  Hi, I'm not sure how to pronounce the name.

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem. That's usually the first question. Okay.

0:12 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  How do you it? So it's João.

0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very nasal. João.

0:19 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Don't worry about it.

0:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very difficult to pronounce it. But Jao is usually the way people say it. Okay.

0:27 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I'm going to do it.

0:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

0:28 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Perfect.

0:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect.

0:30 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  And yours is Mojito?

0:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mojito? Yeah.

0:33 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Mojito. Mojito.

0:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mojito doesn't know. You know what I mean, right? So. are doing? Good.

0:41 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Good. What time is it there right now?

0:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's 5.45.

0:45 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Easy. Okay. How about you?

0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's in the morning. It's 9.15. Here in Brazil. Where are you?

0:54 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I'm in the south of Brazil.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah, okay.

0:58 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Got it. Yeah.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a challenge for me to schedule time with Alex because it's really inverse so either he stays up late or I wake up early or both.  don't know, I get confused.

1:12 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  So you have met?

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We've met, yes, not in real life but we've chatted for a few times and I think the vibe was right, we just understood each other.  I like the way he thinks. think he has a lot of taste and width and I really value that.  And when I came across his stuff, because somebody else pointed out to his stuff, I had to send him a message like, oh, this is so clever and so tasteful.  I really just want to talk to you and know more about what's behind it, right? And that was it.

1:51 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I bumped into Alex who worked on, he had put out this like a crowdsourced presentation on perspective and that really hit the nail on the head for me.  I was like, this really makes sense. the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about it. And I had dropped a message to Alex also about that.  I actually kept thinking about what is our perspective on this. fortunately, I think so that I've been able to come with something that is better than what we had before.  I had gone through the presentation. I shared that with Alex also. So that has been very helpful. Just going through the presentation has been very helpful.  I mean, it's been on the ones. Yeah.

2:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that carousel was historic. It went everywhere. was really good. But so Alex, I took a look at your website and the way people talk about it.  I don't want to come across as insincere, but I think it was very. cohesive right and I don't want to just drop compliments but we've seen so many like oh we get presentations and then they focus only on the aesthetics and it was even in the design of the website there was like this clear clear thing about structure and no and I like that so and Alex told me that you guys would like to perhaps include a little bit more workshoppy things into your process.  Would you care to?

3:30 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I'm not sure what that even means really but I can tell you what the problem we discussed was that you know we we feel that so we do we love our work and because that we go really deep into the work and because that there is a number of iterations on with the client there's no end to it and we don't have a proper structure we have worked intuitively so we go in and we like okay we'll figure this out but  We don't have structure that in first session, we are going to do this. Second session, we're going to do this.  Then know what are we doing? just know it happens. And hence, we can't even structure it and say that in call one, it's going to happen like this.  Call two, this is going to happen. And this is your part of work. This is our part of work.  So we feel that because of subjectivity around all of this, it kind of just gets out of hand completely.  And you might have a glitch also, right? So when I saw their work also, in some way, I do see the relationship between our work and their work that so they do positioning for the customer and create a homepage out of it.  And we do positioning for the investor and create a deck out of it, right? So most of the work happens around that work.  now, but when I see how they process, how they do it, then we're going to do two calls of 45 minutes each.  I'm like, how can somebody do you get a call and you know you have a framework fine but how do you make sure that you know the client is satisfied after that and there are not new ideas coming after that also it's subjective it's creative and you know sometimes you have a new idea of conditioning afterwards and what do you do and so we really get stuck with that and I think we end up spending a lot fine with that so maybe if that is what workshops are that you know it's very well organized structured I don't know what but you know it kind of creates boundaries around the engagement I'm not sure so this but this is the problem that I discuss with Alex and it's a constant thing for us thank you thank you for the context I really I've been there and sometimes I find myself there also so I don't think workshops are like the silver bullet that will solve this for sure but they do help in the sense that they create

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like time box things, they give a certain structure, and they can also be, you know, structured but a little bit flexible in a way you run them, which would account for some of this, but would not like eliminate the process completely, I think.  And because I think to address that, so speaking from experience, just full disclosure, people have asked me in do this kind of thing that you guys do, because that's who I'm the person they know for this, but I don't think I'm the best for this.  just, I did it like maybe three times over seven years. But, but I understand exactly what you mean, like then revisions, then they read the post, then it takes a long time on revisions, and then they keep adding revisions.  this thing, it doesn't look like this thing, and it broke again inside of the engagement that the logic snapped.  So yeah, I think workshops can help to a point on that one. and then there's the other things like I'm sure that the Fletch guys have really clear rules of engagement between themselves like we go up to this point and here in Brazil I think that you're based in India yeah but your clients are global any clients are still in India only okay because here in Brazil at least the work culture is very much like people expect that service providers just keep going the extra mile forever yeah and I think that in the US is a little bit easier to just say look I go up to this point so I don't want to discourage you any we're just talking shop here right um so I think one way that they seem to address it is because they keep talking about their method there's there are no surprises when people get to the method they did they know what's going to happen right  So, sorry, I went on a bit of a ramble. I can show you my basic process for trying to convert these sort of things into more workshop kind of things.  And I just wanted to caveat that I cannot promise that this will just cut everything into a square. But I can show you how I think about this and maybe we'll discuss over there.

8:24 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Can I share my screen with you?

8:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, please.

8:27 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  So, do you work as a team or are you like a solopreneur?

8:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm a solopreneur. Yeah. Okay.

8:33 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  And for how long you've been doing this?

8:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, this more recent positioning, like this name in this brand, two years. But I've been doing this like workshops, custom workshops, converting expertise into workshops for like 10 years.  But that just didn't know the name for it. Yeah.

8:52 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  What were you calling it earlier?

8:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was working in innovation consulting, but because of clients usually had like specific. So I was not doing design sprints like cookie cutter design sprints.  You could do them as well. did them as well. But a lot of times I was creating the workshop for the engagement, which was like constantly customizing the thing.  Let me find. Okay. Okay. So I'm a bit self-conscious now because I'll share a slide with you and you're an expert at this.  So thank you for being kind.

9:30 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Okay.

9:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the stages of the process, actually, this is not the thing I want to show you. Basically, because I think I've said you already, the blog post, in terms of the way  work is we create the workshop together and then we talk about, I train you or I help you teach your team how to run it because there are workshop skills that are sometimes less obvious, how to deal with a participant that cannot stop talking, how to deal with a participant that will not open up and stuff like this.  I think there's also an element of branding it, giving it a name, something that people can point out and say, I want that workshop from Dexterouser and we then have like SOPs and stuff like that that, you know, you know exactly how to process the workshop through when a client comes in and what happens.

10:43 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  you define what do you mean by workshop? Because I would have never used a workshop as a word for what we are talking about here.  Even Alex mentioned this, I thought of it like I wouldn't have thought of workshop. Thank you.

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for that. Otherwise, I'll just go on. So a workshop is a guided collaborative meeting where you mix the client's context with your subject matter expertise, right?  So if it's just a client with their own subject matter expertise, or their own context, and they don't have your help to turn it into something else, they keep going in circles because they cannot, you know, integrate what you know about solving their problems.  If you as a consultant are working in isolation without involving the client, there's a high likelihood that one of these or many of these will happen, which is you design something or create a solution that doesn't fit with actually they need, or it doesn't fit with what they can do, right?  It's a proper thing, it's well done. makes sense, but that client will not be able to do it because they're lacking something.  Could be time, capabilities, the contacts, the text tag, whatever. So by putting both of things together, you solve the problem in the session.  And then there's the added benefit, which I think my favorite, which is because the client was involved in the creation, they will help sell it, right?  It's like that IKEA effect thing, like you like things that participate in. So I think that's actually like the secret sauce of workshops.  Because then you get to decision quicker, and also you get people automatically trained to defend those decisions, like champions to spread out that thing.  Because I did this thing with those deck rooster guys, you should identify with that. And is this a good definition to you?

13:00 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah, I mean it is, mean I wouldn't have just used the world workshop but I think in one way I do feel, I mean I'm still skeptical that this can work for us but I do feel this is where I want our service to get to where right now what we do is we go on a call with the client at different things when for building a positioning on narrative then building the wireframe then doing the design we go on the call with the client take their inputs and like of course there's a interaction and discussion and there's some figuring out happen but we say okay fine we'll listen to this call recording now and you know we'll do our own brainstorming and whiteboarding and discussion with internally thinking and we'll do iterations internally and then come back to you to present this idea to you which is a very very long process.  I'm skeptical that it can happen on the call but it will be amazing to be able to do on the call that  different part of it also you know even if it takes more calls with the client it will be better I understand the value that you said about client is more committed to defending it because these things are subjective you can keep going on and on for as long as you want otherwise and keep finding for this no I mean there's no perfection in this yeah it's a matter of taste right the taste is very subjective and then some one person can come out from outside and give a feedback and I don't think this is good you know why don't you try this and say yeah that's let me you know they will point to us and say hey I've got another idea and I want to start doing this because suddenly it's like for them it's just one small idea on one small slide you know but we know it's going to reflect the whole deck or a significant part of the deck we can't just let it can't just happen like that I think we are also I don't like that within this we are also really bad at telling limiting the client in terms of let's say iteration  the stuff and say that hey, you know, fine, if you've got a new idea, that's fine. I know now we'll do one more iteration of this and that's going to cost you extra for this thing.  We're not good at it. And just before this call, I was having a call retro of a project with my team.  And this is one of the things that is also coming up constantly that, you know, we don't set limits in the number of iterations, we don't have anything like that in our in our work, because we believe that if it's the best idea, it should be implemented.  And the client takes some of these things for granted. Maybe Indian culture is also bad. So we're starting with some of these things for sure.  Happy to hear.

15:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One of the things that, thank you for the additional context and it helps me. So one of the things that I've noticed also for myself is sometimes instead of framing the work and maybe you guys do this, I couldn't find it.  Framing the work in terms of like sprints, because then it happens within the sprint, you have revisions within the  sprint, right? It's just an idea. Maybe there's other things. What I like about this sprint thing is that there's a certain level of flexibility because the client moves fast and there's an incentive for them to move fast as well with feedback.  You can do more things but at some point it just ends. You get our attention for this amount of time and then we have to let it go.  But that doesn't make it easier to say, yeah, we won't do that thing. It's still a difficult thing at least in my experience.  I think for the work you do, it would never be just one session. It could never be one session.  It would have to be several sessions. I can show you also something that I did. This is something that I'm putting together, a new format for me and I'll share with you.

17:00 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  and see what I do for you. Now I can see y'all.

17:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So basically, I'll dive into the appropriate level of Zoom level. So basically, the way to figure out what would be the best workshop format for you guys would go and realize what is the current aha moment that your clients have when they work with you.  And then from that, and there's ways to figure this out. And then from that, we lean into that aha moment and say, oh, clients like when we are really good with word play on the spot.  So let's create the workshop structure that gives us a time and a place for doing that so that clients have an opportunity to see us do the thing we do best.  And then we slice the workshop experience. And what I mean is I think the flat guys to do this.  There are things that happen in the session. There's things that happen before the session. And there's things that happen after the session, right?  So silly example. Before the workshop, maybe there's an intake questionnaire. Maybe you guys already did this. But that's something that will help the workshop, because it gives you insight and ingredients to work with on the workshop.  What happens after the workshop is we can use the workshop output, like the canvas that we fill in and export it as a PDF, send it to them and it will travel inside of their company because they're like, hey, I did this thing with those guys from Deck Rooster.  It's really good. And after we slice the experience, we assemble the workshop with activities, right? We'll just stack activities on it.  And there's a logic to this. But I know this is still a little bit abstract. So I'd like to ask a different question.  In your testimonials, a lot of them, I think, were praising, I think, the depth of your thinking and the quality of the synthesis.  So these are very important things, but also a little bit less pinnable, right? You cannot really point to a place and say, oh, this was when the client understood that they've made the right decision in hiring us.  In your experience, is there a specific moment that happens often when clients are like, oh, yes, these guys get me?

19:44 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I mean, I don't know how much time we want to put in this. can explain. I do have the time, but thank you for that.  See, basically, there are three different engagements that we have. Okay. I'll give you. just of the three different engagements and this has also been evolving a little bit over time.  You know, it's also some bit of this also very recent. So, people come to us for making unistradicts. You know, that's, that's most people come for, but their problem might be different.  So, at the lowest level, the problem could be that, hey, they have got an unistradict already, with the content messaging, nearly okay, final, they are good with that.  The messaging and communication quality is not so good. You know, so they want to land those messages more impact.  Let's say your deck, the one that you're looking at. You say, I'm very happy with this. I've been, you know, doing my sales call using this deck for a while.  Both are okay for me. I don't see any problems with this, but I want this, this look and feel also and communication also the messaging also has to land.  Okay, it's the lowest level of our engagements. This works mostly the smoothest, this engagement works okay. Then there is one on the other end which is our flagship work which is something that we do figure out the positioning and narrative.  we basically reposition the company for investors. We rethink what the company is. For example, you reposition to work. sort of, okay, what do I really want to say this work is?  So we reposition the companies for investors and how do you want to present your company to investors? That work is our flagship work.  Most of the testimonials that you have seen are mostly around that work. So we used to do that work plus the deck also.  was combined one engagement. used called full engagement where we do this work first and then build a deck also.  We use a deck basically as a medium to have conversations to drive, to get ideas from the client for all this process because otherwise they don't know how to think about it.  So deck was more of a, and they needed a deck finally. but deck was, we realized over time that deck was the way we were able to.  have this conversation instruction rather make them think about it. Recently what we've done is we have split this into two parts.  say figuring out positioning a narrative is one part has nothing to do with the deck. It is a strategic exercise that you may be relevant for your business in general.  You know and because you know we want to just run this separately one is I think partially because for two reasons let me know if you're not able to follow at any point in time.  But let's say the reason we are separating this out is one because we want to make this more strategic it is more strategic but when we combine the deck it looks like a deck building exercise only and you can only charge it you know for the deck to some extent it's right so sort of sledge guys I mean somebody might think that homepage they are making homepage only so you know the other guys making homepage for this much why should I pay this much but they have done a good job in making sure that the position this has positioning work.  and not homepage so so we have sort of separating this out and say okay as an output of this we'll give you like a document of positioning and narrative and not a deck right so and third engagement which is in the middle is basically building a deck from scratch for people who do not have a deck in place yet they feel they have position and narrative figure out they know their positioning and they know their narrative they don't want us to get involved in the rethink in those parts so that's our middle engagement something that we have done we have split this two now to make this one and this one these are a little tricky for us don't know it's also new for us to but we know for sure what happened our largest flagship engagement when you figure out somebody's new positioning when you figure out their positioning they're like  it just makes sense. That happens a lot of times. On the other end also, the smallest engagement that we have, I think there's a lesser of a aha moment, but yeah, aha moment when they see their first time designed deck.  you know, they see that, this is coming really well. I really like it. The middle one, we're not very sure at what point there's a aha moment, because I think there's a constant struggle against running against the time also, which kind of takes away from the experience sometimes because investor presentations, they have a meeting planned up and they want something done like fast, fast, fast and they, so sometimes it's, it's kind of takes away from the experience of client itself and say that, you know, while you've done a good job, suddenly, you know, at the towards the end, you are not delivering good quality and, know, I said, do all these things, you're not able to do these things.  now come asking for iteration, you're asking for more pricing. So sometimes it takes a So we're not sure how to structure this engagement.  I think we are failing on that one right now. But that's long, not through your question. No, no, this is a good answer.

25:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. So the intermediate product, it's like literally the middle child, A little bit in between worlds, yeah, OK.

25:21 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I mean, if I give an opportunity, I will actually let go completely. And so we don't do it at all.  We do our first work, which is a flagship work, which is the most highly valued work out there. And I would love to do the end one, because that's highly scalable and easy to find talent, very structured, no problems.  Because I think it is out of, because when somebody comes, they don't have a good deck or their current deck is not worthy for the last engagement.  I can't just tell them, go find somebody. At least I don't have the courage right now to say that they go find somebody else for this work.  We do only these two parts. I don't know a good answer what we should be doing, but this is the problem, which I think, I think I understand what you mean.

26:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I understand what you mean. So something perhaps similar happened to me the other day. And I'll tell it to you and you let me know if this is a good comparison.  So I was helping someone create visual frameworks, right? Visuals that explain their work and their perspective. And this is like copywriting for your eyes, right?  Just making images that explain the process or a structure or perspective or something. And these things can be as simple as, you know, just the index card with the drawing and the drawing communicates and that's it.  Or you can involve like a graphic designer and have the same triangle with some gradients and some cool styling, know, and just take it to the next level, but it's the same structure, right?  I don't like to do this in part. I don't like to do the like the graphic design aspect. like to do the thinking about the...

27:00 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  major architecture of the idea let's say but sometimes I come across clients that they are not used to hiring other talent right they don't add they don't know what to call to turn this thing into like a fancy uh social media posts right yeah and then it's really difficult to tell them yeah guys um that I won't I won't go into that because I feel like I'm letting them on and I'm not taking the thing all the way to the finish line yeah even though yeah so it's it's kind of like this it's kind of like this to come extreme yes um I think maybe one more angle I'll give you is that you know um see when you give us I know for sure that if I if you're making a deck for you for as long as the problem statements and anything that you want us to do is contain within a slide and you say okay I'm not happy with the slide I want to change the message of the slide I won't do something with the slide which is within the slide it's very easy for a it's a very defined problem statement when you have that you know I want to say something this  deck. That for you, it might be one slide. For us, it's effect across the deck. And we have to think through all of that before we can present it after you, right?  We don't like those kinds of challenges. It's messy because you feel as client that I only asked for this one thing to change, why don't we do it?  And you're like, no, it doesn't work like that. It's breaking the whole flow. So that is probably the messy part as well.  I think it's also a little bit of just one slide, more context is also that we have grown from a very small size of three, four people to now 20 people team.  So sometimes it's, you know, challenges also that we know I, when I was involved in every single project, I could control the quality much better.  But when others are doing it, it's much harder, much, much harder. So it's very hard to keep up with the same expectation that we have built with a brand that when I was doing work,

29:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would assume that you founded the company, right?

29:07 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah. Yeah.

29:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you are the initial, you know, spark of the, like, you probably, if I look at your browsing history, I'll see articles about how to communicate ideas, slide decks, investor relations stuff like that.  But some people on your team, it's just a job, it's normal, right? So it's difficult to scale that level of passion, and I think I understand that.  Okay, so there's a couple of things here. I'm stepping away from the workshop things, because I don't think there's much point in me trying to sell your workshop now.  We'll just explore this thing. Why is it that? Because I think we are still, I'm still trying to create a model of the situation that you have.  Okay. And then we'll see.

30:00 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  workshop fits that that model. Yeah, that's fine.

30:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the things that you've mentioned that was difficult, and I, I empathize with, was like this justifying design design decisions to non designers, right?  And it's not just design, it's also narrative and storytelling and copywriting and, you know, information architecture, and the way to justify this to people that they don't see it.  Like, it's like an iceberg. They see the top of the iceberg and say, I don't like this slide. And then you have to explain, look, there's a logic to this slide.  This slide has this purpose. This is a politically tiring process, right? You need to get those guys to listen to you.  So there's that aspect. And I think it's, it's around, it seems to be around finding ways of justifying those design decisions.  There's the other thing which is scaling. in taste, I think, because you're probably being the founder in the principle.  Are there, do you have a co-founder? No.

31:11 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  It was you from the start, right?

31:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I would assume that some of this stuff is like second nature to you and it's even difficult to explain.  It takes a lot more time to explain why you think this slide doesn't work. Just you go and change it, right?

31:25 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah, I think now we spend some time to document some of these things. That's why I spend more time now, how to think about narrative, how to think about tech, how to think about a certain slide.  Yeah, but I was there when, you know, it was more intuitive and harder to explain.

31:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Here's what I'm thinking. I'm going to think out loud. So maybe at the end of my sentence, I want to make a  The, the work that he do has this really deep integration into how people think about their business, right? Yeah.  that's something that probably takes a little bit of time, like even neuroplasticity perspective probably takes a little bit of time.  There's only so much you can change within some, some amount of time. And maybe I'm stepping out of my.

32:31 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  So in the first engagement, our flagship engagement definitely yes, but we don't pay enough of your trouble there. In the second engagement, I'm not sure how much we are trying to change how we think about it, but to some extent yes.  But I'm not sure how much of that is a problem. I'm not sure of that. I can't say. Okay.  Okay.

32:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Right now, from my understanding, I think the middle engagement, yes, we could create some sessions or workshop structures that could help with that.  But it feels much more like it exists in this no man's land, right? So it has influence from the two extremes of kinds of projects.  So I could see workshops helping a little bit. I could not see workshops fixing that middle, the messy middle, so to say.

33:45 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Okay, rather, know, I feel in our work, second one is what is second and third of the most well  suited for a workshop because there is less subjectivity you know these are I mean I think the first one of flagship work is more creative work and I feel there is I would I would have guess there is lesser scope for workshops but still might be but I think second one I do feel I don't good answers but I do feel that there is a scope to structure a well in a very organized manner see the problems don't happen at the design level the problem happened for example let's say one thing because when you're building a deck for you in this deck for you we have chosen to say some things we have chosen certain messages for you we're saying okay this is how we're going to go to the market you had certain ideas about how you're to go to the market good chicken strategy and we captured all  all those things and they kind of, you know, presented and articulated and presented in a certain manner. Now, you are, you may think that, you know, this is good, this is not good or, you know, even the, let's say the company's problem statement, you know, problem solution becomes like opportunity becomes like the most critical place.  How we are articulating your problem statement. So how we are articulating and to what level of depth we are articulating there are multiple issues and different ways of thinking, know, and how we are putting that out and how we are visualizing this.  Sometimes these things kind of change and these are the most foundational pieces. If a company's problem statement, solution, opportunity, this changes, all this everything else can change, you know, but for example, if the GDM strategy side changes or a team side changes, it won't have significant impact.  It can't have a ripple effect across the deck. So I do see an opportunity to, because you're not redefining the company in the second engagement, that's what we do in the first one that you know, completely redefine how, what you say about what the company does.  So in second one, we're not doing that, we're trying to capture your ideas, the whole positioning itself is that we capture all your ideas and take this job of you making the deck easy for you.  So, because we're not trying to, you know, what the company does, and we're saying that, hey, we're going to capture all your ideas in a structured manner.  So we'll run the workshops, let's say, to, in a very organized manner, structure, capture your ideas that nothing gets missed out, you can think, you can articulate your ideas sometimes, but we will make you articulate your ideas, take them in order, put them in structure, give it back to you so that you feel that, hey, my work got done.  That's what we really want to, we don't want to rethink your business in this one. That is separating out of these things.

37:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's something we could shape something around for sure. Now, just to be sure, I don't want to be wrong here.  So when you've told me about the three different engagements, when you say flagship, you're talking about the least involved one or the most involved one?

37:26 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Most involved, right?

37:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. And the least involved one, what's the internal name you have for it?

37:34 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  internal name for that is impact boost. So the least involved is impact boost, the middle engagement is called storycraft and the first one is called positioning and narrative.  You can say IBSC just to be shorter.

38:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, this is good because I wanted to be sure. Yeah, so the first one impact boost is not so much about workshops.  We could have like if you wanted in the future or something you could have like some workshops for like the first like taking the client in but it would be just a next level thing.  The storycrafts the challenge with so from what you tell me the challenges with the storycraft is not the design.  It's that some parts have more impact. It would be very good if we could shape a workshop that gets like the basics right and then just uses best practices for the non critical parts which like the team and stuff like that.  I would assume you guys already do something like this that you begin with. getting the most fundamental aspects right first, right?  That's how it works.

39:07 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  try to be very organized in that and because it's a newer engagement for us, we are separated out from the first one.  We're still rethinking at this point also constantly rethinking how we should be running our process. We have certain ideas we don't have full clarity of those so we are, because we've done this work for a long time, we know this intuitively, but somebody else documented and say, okay, what is the, what are the steps that you follow?  We're not fully sure exactly, more like that, let me get on the call with you and let me ask you to explain your business and ask you a certain question that we have this stuff that says, start taking quotes and then when I take the recording of this, that's when I start my intuitive sense of how an aesthetic should be.  I'll start preparing something around that. I think you write that if we can, in a structured manner, create materials around the core pieces and say, OK, so are you think this is the problem statement that you're solving, but this is not very.  But at the same time, they want us to give some input. I'm saying, hey, it's not very impactful from a master point of view.  And let's re-articulate this. It's not good enough. So let's say our framework should tell them and say, you know, hey, this is not good enough.  Your problem statement is not well-defined. We need to rework on this and ask them more questions and maybe something else comes out and re-articulate it.  And then they say, yeah, this is good. This work will work well. And so let's move to the solution part.  Let's move to the TG part. We should also be able to identify, let's say, that, OK, there are five pieces that are critical for a company.  Let's say your TG, your market, your positioning, some of these things. And we need this input from you. Typically, people have not thought clearly about their positioning.  So what we need is to articulate this clearly. So why don't you do here is the process or here is the framework that will follow.  I'll define what are the critical pieces. We have a sense, we have an article. So what are the critical pieces, and then in what manner do we take it, and how do we solidify them so they don't keep moving all the time, and now how do we build other pieces around it physically?

41:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so you do have an explicit list of questions that you use internally.

41:26 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  So we do have, but that is for the larger engagement that we were doing, and now when we're going to this middle engagement separately, we are rethinking some of these questions because we don't want to go to the same level of depth that we went to, but we have that list of questions.

41:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because this is also a product or an offering that is more recent, you're developing it, you're figuring out what stays and what is left out.  Right? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. So conceptually, the way I think about it this would be um yeah you have a list of slides that are more crucial or more fundamental or more keystone some words like this right and and you have ways of thinking about these slides right so when we're talking about the the problem statement slide you should point out to an actual pain or maybe some data you have ways of thinking about this yeah so a way to structure a workshop around that could be something generically like this um the output of that workshop is the information for that slide or for not not that slide that section right yeah so at the end you have info info info section x  Okay. I will show you my screen and what I'm drawing in the second. Exercise. And then, okay, so let's see.  I don't know if it's super clear, but basically at the end the the output of the workshop is a section with pieces of information that you need to have gathered, right?  And you have different exercises for each different part of the information. And the transition from one thing to the other is really light, it's really smooth, so it doesn't feel like work.  But at the end on the output, you can have all the information that you need and the client also sees that you have that you have a specific way of thinking about it.

44:00 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah, and this could go ahead.

44:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry. Sorry.

44:04 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah, I agree with you because if they see that there is a structure to doing the thing and it's not just random, they also feel more comfortable and confident about where they have arrived.  Yes. So I agree with you on that.

44:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and I think there's also, it's very much related to that, but a certain trust in the work, right?  Oh, there's a method to this because there's no definitive answers. You need to put a lot of weight into the process, right?  The only way of judging the answers is like the rigor of the process because you cannot judge the quality of the answer, just the answer.  So maybe for this would be something like a canvas, right? That you have the ingredients for it. the perfect slide that talks about problem opportunity.  And then there's a problem statement, apologies. And then you could have, you could have, I really like the idea of archetypes, because, and I'm sure you see this, there are many ways of addressing the question of what's the best way to introduce the problem statement, right?  There's probably like, oh, if you're dealing with a new industry, this is best way of doing it. If you're dealing with a health care industry, this is the best way to do it.  you're dealing with an incumbent, this is the best way to do it. If you're trying to get funding for your startup from corporate venture capital, you should talk in this way.  There's probably patterns around this. Yeah. And if you isolate the pieces of information, from the patterns then you can say oh with this information that you've just asked you guys we can manifest this information in different approaches right the same pieces of information we structure them in different ways and again you reinforce the depth of how much you think about this like you know that there's many ways of presenting a problem statement so it's like sub canvases you know I can mix I can whip out something really quickly though I know there's no compromise that just like thinking about this stuff I'm like you I get involved so but maybe there's something there do you mind if I use another example yeah let's go ahead so are you familiar with that book the business model canvas not the canvas but the book yeah okay do  remember that in the book they show how the business model canvas looks like for Apple, for Spotify, for Amazon?  Yeah, I haven't read the book.

47:10 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  have only seen the canvas a lot more, but I can imagine how that would be young. Yeah.

47:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is really clever because they made the canvas, right? And then they do a really good job at presenting the canvas, became a worldwide sensation.  Great. But I think one of the things that they did that was really clever was that they showed all of their tool applied to things that people would already recognize, right?

47:34 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah.

47:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very clever because they managed to introduce an abstract thing in ways that other people already had the mental model for.  looks like this on the canvas. Yes, Apple looks like this. Oh, I understand the canvas, right? So if you do something like that, which is you collect information, let's assume this.  We are building a workshop for designing the problem statement. of a presentation. Okay. And there's some information that you'd like to have for that, and the some information that you need, and some of it would be nice to have, right?  Like, I need to know these things, but if have these things, we can go further. I usually call this the bronze option, the silver option, and the gold option, because people instinctively understand that, okay, there's levels to this, but bronze is not bad.  Gold is better, but bronze is not bad, right? So, and you go through the session with the client, and you collect all these different pieces of information that will be your ingredients for putting together the section, right?  Then you come to the client say, okay, because you are addressing the healthcare industry, the most appropriate archetype for this section is this one.  There's this other archetypes for other situations, but we're choosing this one, right? And the good thing about that, I believe, is they understand that this is not just based on your opinion or your design taste, it's based on logic, right?  And maybe there's a way, especially for some crowds that don't really understand design, but they understand templates and they understand, like, best practices, that they will say, OK, yeah, I understand why.

49:30 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Yeah. Thank for giving me the extra time.

49:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you to you too.

49:54 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I mean, I was wondering if it's going to be just three minutes, what are we going to be able to cover?

50:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think I think I just got excited because the first 15 minutes would be just like getting to know each other and so on, but then we got into it and it's fine.  So I think I think conceptually this is the idea, right? We do the workshop activities on this side and then they become like bits of information in the canvas that says what that section must have.  Let's say the problem setting section and then we have archetypes for scenarios and then we say, oh, for your situation, this is the archetype.  So we're doing this and and then it's easier for them to do it. Do you work mostly remote or in person?

50:55 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Just one second, just give me one second. Yeah, sorry, yeah, I'll put it in more detail than John. Good.  Here's what I'm thinking.

51:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll just, you know, put all this stuff in an email, send it to you. mean, just, it is what it is.  don't need to pay anything for that. And you see what ideas come to mind. If you don't mind, I might recommend maybe a book or two because maybe...  interesting stuff. And we'll just keep the channel open.

52:04 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  mean, yeah, and then see if, you know, I have a point where if you feel confident that, you know, your work can add value to that would love to explore that also.

52:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do think it can, but I also think you need to marinate on it and think about it. And every one questions.  I suspect you like to reflect on things for for a bit to see if they match. I just don't know.  I don't want to be pushy. And I feel confident that at the very least we can learn from each other.  But I think, yeah, in the future, something could come out of it for sure.

52:42 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  But you want to give me sense of how does your work work? Yeah, how to charge? Yeah, for sure.  Yeah.

52:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for the workshop, this is for for 90-minute sessions on Miro and like one per week. Then there's also a week in which we don't meet that I'm working behind the scenes.  I can send in the more detailed proposal, but anyway, basically, that's it. On the sessions that we meet, the 90-minute sessions, we go over your process and we extract the aha moments of your process and we create an experience around that.  The people that should join that, ideally, no more than three people. Otherwise, it gets a little bit confusing and equipped with first-hand information of how things go.

53:52 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  So we wouldn't be like a secretary or an intern, but is not an intern or a first-hand and then we discuss.

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll just say a $2,000 and at the end you have a workshop and the assets for the workshop.  What are the assets for the workshop? You have all the canvases and the boards. I'm used to Miro but I've used all the other tools like Fig Jam, Muro, Whimsical.  We can find something that works for you guys and even you can do it without these whiteboarding tools. I prefer with the whiteboarding but if you want we can shape it around Google Docs and stuff like that.  And so you have that, you have a facilitation guide which is like the instructions of how to run the workshop and also it's like a script with the times and the activities in the outputs.  So this thing I've mentioned now is much more like to help you keep track of stuff and the facilitation guide is more something that ideally you read beforehand.  you will maybe check it out while you're doing the thing if you have a question, but you should need to.  And the workshop asset, right? canvas and all of this. Yeah, and I think that's it. is it like one workshop?

55:16 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  Is it a workshop?

55:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a good point because this is for a workshop, but I think in your case it makes sense to do one workshop per section, right?  Yeah, yeah. I think even, what do you prefer? Do you prefer to try this out, dip your feet? Or do you prefer to get more fully packaged thing?  I'm not sure.

55:50 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  I mean, yeah, I mean, I think the cost becomes one way to think about it because you're like, know, I think my production would be to say, okay, you know, let's do a fully packaged thing.  Once there is comfort and confidence on both sides, this can work out. But the cost will then only be the only thing to think about.  say, hey, do we really want to invest this much right now to do this? And hence, let's maybe, you know, divide feed and see how it goes.  And, you know, so, so yeah, but that's how I would think.

56:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think the same way, to be honest. I think it's best if it just starts all and then build up the confidence from there.  I'm confident in the work enough that I think that's a good way. And I also, when people join, want them to feel as comfortable as they can be.  So, yeah, I would start small, not like a package of workshops multiplying that price. I wouldn't. want to do that, to be honest.  But OK, next steps. I'll send you everything that we've discussed here. I know that there's the AI thing, but it's not the same if we just put our thought to paper.  You'll think about it. I'll send you some book recommendations. I cannot help it. I'll be thinking about this. know how it is.  Ideas will come to me. And we stay in touch. Do you have some deadline on which you want to make a decision on this or something coming up?

57:34 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  No, because it's never on the mind. this is very critical for us anyways. So no deadline like that, but you are critical for us.  Very critical. Got it.

57:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are you satisfied with this conversation? is helpful to you? No, very helpful.

57:50 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  This has given me a direction to think about. I'm actually looking forward to the books or ideas, because I love to  more prepared into an engagement like this one because I want to do our part of the work. You know, make sure that we are ready for taking up something like this and you want to think deeply about it.  yeah, no, I'm very interested. I'm very satisfied. Oh, thank you. I don't get to get a chance to speak to someone like Alex, you, you know, so very often because I'm mostly talking to the startup founders who are my potential clients.  So, you know, I use this as also an opportunity to see just how others are doing their thing.

58:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I think that's the favorite part, my favorite part of the job is talking to other, you know, experts.  Perfect. So that's it, Mohit. I will send you the stuff. Thank you for the time. Thank you for the extra time.

58:59 - Mohit Bansal (Deck Rooster)
  This is really

59:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  interesting and I I loved also how you insisted on nuance because at some points I was like I think it's like this instead it's kind of like that but not like that and that's very useful so thank you for for being like part of on that and I'll send you the email today sounds good thank you so much for your extra time too I mean I was really glad to be even good to be able to hear your brain and hear out your perspective on artwork so I'm stripping poverty email and our future conversation perfect likewise so much all right have a nice one you bye bye
