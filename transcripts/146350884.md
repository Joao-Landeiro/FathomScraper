0:08 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  was in the middle of the show.

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a week. On this. I don't know why that's strange It's not the first time that happens to be but I think it only happens well now that I'm talking to you I think it only happens when it when it comes from like a difference calendar like this Maybe calendly think I don't know if it wasn't going to leave I think so yeah calendly usually it works really Well, I don't I've heard that before I think it's happened to me before as well, I'm not sure why So So anyway, thank you Glenn I was checking out your your bio.  So you you said like former royal marine Yeah, roll my rings commando of nine. Yes. Yeah, there's a guy.  follow around on the internet. so funny Benforth, I don't know. Maybe it's a small world there. Do you know this guy Benforth?

1:50 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Yeah, does he work at leadership development?

1:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so it's coming to command control.

1:56 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  think yeah, yeah, I think Anyway, immediately, immediately took me there.

2:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you?

2:06 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Good. How are you? How What about you again in Brazil?

2:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sao Paulo. No. it Qui Tiba? Qui Tiba is like 400 kilometers south of Sao Paulo. Which in Brazil is caused by?  Yeah.

2:22 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  in Portugal. Yeah. It's funny because I was, I don't know if you saw what I'm doing, Miss. I'm beginning a project of building well-being retreats or places in Portugal, and it's really funny because everybody I've spoken to, they say, don't do it too far away from the cities because Portuguese won't travel.  They won't travel too far.

2:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A lot of people told you this?

2:54 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Yeah. Yeah. I was looking at Serco de Chtorello.

2:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh-huh.

2:59 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Yeah. And a lot of people said, oh, it's three hours or, you know, three and a half hours is a bit too far.  So basically, the feedback I got was doing it within an hour and a half.

3:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So I have two feelings about that. The first one is that definitely Portuguese, especially when compared to Brazilians, we have this resistance to trips.  It's like we are used to a small country. one hour, that's a lot. That's like crossing the country. So I think psychologically that has been the biggest difference when I moved here.  Yeah, yeah. Because here people will say like, oh, let's go out. Let's go to a club, 300 kilometers from here is to the point of being irresponsible.  It's insane. It's not super common, but people do it. I know people that do it. And they don't sleep there.  Just go and drive back, which is nuts. But unfortunately, the other way, but my parents, they travel for food.  They will drive for a while to go to a restaurant, and I think maybe there's something there, because if you've noticed how much food has a place in our culture, so maybe there's something there.

4:18 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  I don't know if I told you, but my wife I see her mum, I'm getting something, I don't know, visual, pepperaries, right?

4:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go back and forth.

4:42 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Cool, so Riley, I know you've spoken to Riley, I'm pet, right? can you explain a little bit more about what you do as a coach consultant?

4:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. I great work. I create custom workshops for consultants. So basically my thesis is that everybody's talking about productization.  And there's a lot of ways of going about that. And I think workshops are a very good first step towards that, before people start thinking about software, signatures, stuff like that.  think workshops are a good way of starting.

5:24 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Yeah, I had a quick look at your LinkedIn. And I've worked with a lot of consultants. And there's definitely a place for that, for sure.

5:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm getting more comfortable with that. Because at first, I mean, I'm sure this is familiar. But people tell you to niche down, and then you start coming up with weird combinations.  You're kind of nicheing down a lot. But it's just based on an internal feeling about it. And this is not the first time I've ever had.

7:00 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  that.

7:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I'm still at that phase where, you know, it comes to referrals and people still, you know, there's these referrals come from people that know me to a level that is not very scalable, they really, really get me.  And that's uncommon. And oftentimes, so the thing is not super package, I think, which is a little bit ironic, right, the couple of sun kind of thing kind of deal.  And but but yeah, I have projects and I'm doing things for other people being paid to create workshops and formats.

7:41 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  So it is kind of working. I just wanted to work better. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, I think you're in the right place by talking to Riley overhead.

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I used to work with Riley by the way.

7:53 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Okay, he was the ops guy.

7:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was the marketing and sales guy.

7:57 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Okay. And yeah, we. worked together for a while and then he left, started doing his thing. I did a bunch of different things and then ended up doing his course.  Because it was really weird, right? Because I knew all this stuff.

8:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I knew what I to be doing. Yes.

8:17 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  And I said to him, like, I know what I'm supposed to be doing, but I can't do it. Because it's me, it's wrong with me, you know.  So I did his course and yeah, it was really good. Obviously now I'm doing a few different things, but I decided to help him out with this as well.  Because well, you've spoke to him as a great guy. But yeah, I think you're in the right place. So well, I mean, I'll just unlock everything that's on there for you.  I don't know if you've looked at it yet. you the leverage game?

8:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I went through it when it was just on the notion. Because I've been talking to Bob for a little while.  So I threw it when it was there and and now I'm going through it again because it's just worth it.  It's good stuff and Yeah, I agree. I got I got the feeling that It makes a lot of sense for me to be in this and I was very close I don't know how much context to have about this, but that was really close to getting to the you know the paid package But then like I wasn't sure about cash flow and I went I went to the Right mode and I was like Not not very responsible for me to do this right now and mean they were very gracious about it because I haven't even sent it and then they send the deposit back.  We're super gracious about it, but Yeah, what I'm thinking the way I'm seeing it right now is It's not about information is what you said before so you knew this stuff  but it's not just about knowing the stuff, right? So it's not about information. And I believe in the power of doing things without people and getting guidance and all of that.  I'm sold on that. It has become a little bit of an aspirational thing for me right now, like, oh, I need to get to the level where I can just get this and do it.  I'm convinced it's gonna help me. And well, the free stuff has a lot of value, so I'm going over it and coming up with the same sort of epiphanies, but it's a process.

10:38 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  Like, oh, I knew this and I forgot. knew this. I'll unlock it all for you. There's some extra stuff in there now, a couple bonuses.  One of the bonuses isn't complete yet. think it's called Sales as a Service. But the other two are, and they're actually taken from the program.  OK. I think one of the... it's called the big five. That may help you quite a bit. Yes, how to use AI and chat GPT to brainstorm your ideas on how you package what you're selling and how you present it.  So I'll unlock that for you. And then all I will say is, yeah, my issue was that I had all the information too much information.  And yes, everything from a marketing and sales point. But I, so what I was doing when I was trying to do it myself, I was doing one thing, I'm trying to do another and doing, Oh, what about this?  What about this? Because that was my job before to try other things. it wasn't, it was working, but it was slow.  And I, because I knew what Riley was like, you know, his background, his operations. I said, let me see what your course is all about.  Yeah, I did it. And I can't remember the exact numbers, but there's a video of me somewhere on the website.  You are a ghost study, I think, right? Yeah, however much I paid, I tripled quadrupled it in six weeks however whatever it was so and obviously I because of my background it was more of an extreme result right yeah yeah don't get me wrong like it's not like everyone's doing that but I'm sure he's got a guarantee in there you know so I would yeah I'd say I'd highly recommend it it sounds like you're in the if you're financially there then you're in the right position to do it yeah yeah that's how I feel about it and yeah that's how I feel about it I've noticed that this tendency for for just trying to accumulate information and I think a lot of us do this yeah on the internet stuff and it gives you a false progress right oh now I know what to do but there's a hidden cost to it

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  which is the uncertainty, right? When you were young and dumb, you didn't know there were other ways of doing it.  So it's kind of, in a way, I think looking for too much information is kind of accelerating the trade between balls and wisdom.  there's a balance there that you need to keep and I'm wearing this now.

13:19 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  So, yeah. That's it. It was quite funny because I I left the military and so, you know, I was like, I don't want to be told what to do ever again.  But then I went down that route, gathered loads of information, utilized it, but it just wasn't at the level that I wanted it to be.

13:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then in the end, I ended up going back to Riley saying, please tell me what to do.

13:41 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  And I'll do it and then boom, boom, did it and it worked. That was the best part of it, just being told, this, don't do anything else.  But yeah, so I'll unlock that stuff, have a look at the big five. It sounds like that. will be good for you and then sounds like you're on the edge anyway so if you decide you want to take the lead give me a shout and I'll set up a quick call with Riley and something but apart from that if you've got any questions or want to talk again just let me know cool cool we'll do that for sure thank you for this and yeah I think I think in terms of of like the product everything is very clear to me so it's it's fine um I won't give you being there in Tazimra uh nearly a year okay that we were in it's quite crazy we're in a set up uh-huh for seven months maybe then we said okay we're gonna move north uh to south Pedro de Sol  I set up the company there, was going to buy loads of cheap land, of cheap properties and build all these things and after we'd been there with her auntie for two weeks we found out my wife was pregnant and she said okay I want to go back near my mum and I want to go back near civilization.  We came back.

15:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well congratulations. Is the baby due any time soon?

15:27 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)

15:44 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  She's important.

15:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's the easy mode for me.

15:49 - Glenn Nicholson (Leverage Accelerator)
  being an uncle is fine, right?

15:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not complex. But well congratulations and I hope everything goes was really well for him.
