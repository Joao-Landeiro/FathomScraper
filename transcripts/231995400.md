0:16 - Mikko Mannila (unipro-solutions.com)
  No, no.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you say hello to the note takers? Sometimes I say that when I join and then just to them.

  You're in Germany, right?

0:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

0:38 - Mikko Mannila (unipro-solutions.com)
  I grew up in Finland. I moved a long time ago after one and a half years after my studies.  I did business studies in Finland and I worked in one and a half years in Helsinki and then I got a chance to move.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Germany to work for BWC at the time and I stayed here yeah I'm also an immigrant I'm Portuguese but I live in Brazil okay I've been living in Brazil for 13 years now before that I lived in the Netherlands but okay it's it's always I mean we have that in common I'm sure like finding the weird things about your country that people in your country don't realize and vice versa yeah yeah it definitely it broadens the horizon you know when you see a little bit other cultures as well yeah do you go back often I go back mainly in summer we fins we have a lot of summer cuttages on the lakeside or seaside a very very simple pretty small

  been so much with Sona and some rowing boat or a little bit bigger boat depending on and my I have I have something like that on an island or small island so it's a that's been in the family since since I was born I was two weeks old when I was there the first time so for me it's a kind of the when I go there I know this is a place where I belong and it feels good that must be amazing when when I was in the Netherlands one of my friends was of Fin descent it was North American but like his whole family was from from Finland and I regret to this day I didn't take him up on the on the plan to go hiking and in Finland because he told me there's this law in Finland right in camp anywhere as long as you keep it yeah yeah every every man's law

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's a beautiful concept because in the Netherlands like there's no wildland everything is like structured right everything belongs to someone so it was a huge contrast it's true but it would never work in the Netherlands I mean we are we are a bit lucky that we have a lot of space I mean outside of Helsinki there's enough space for everybody yes it's the same size as Germany with 85 million people and we have soon 6 million people so you know the size is about the same so it's easier to do it for sure for sure I get it yeah but I never ended up going but so thank you thank you for you know being up for for this quick chat I mean there's no big agenda on it I'm just trying to you know meet more people that have this perspective  services, productizing, some of them go into very complex things. Some others are, you know, taking a piecemeal approach. How was it for you guys at UniPro?  What do mean how? The process of coming up with like the first, was it a long time ago?
