1:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello, straight from outer space. I can hear you. Hello, hello, hello.

1:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Hello.

1:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm here in the space.

1:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Of course, of course, I should have known.

1:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I'm always out there.

1:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How are you being there? Good, it's great to see you. It's nice to see you. Did you change your haircut?  Yeah. Yeah, I'm always changing my appearance.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's not.

2:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Changing the skin, the video game skin.

2:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, let me see.

2:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I want to put my microphone. Just a few minutes. No problem. Can you hear me better? Yes, yes.

2:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. I'm embarrassed now because you have this extreme audio profile. Well, let's do it.

2:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I changed my haircut. I bought a new beard machine, so I'm doing everything, so I'm very clean right now.

2:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very clean, very clean.

2:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Caught you on a good day.

2:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you mind if I record this? Yes, go ahead. So, I'll reduce a few things here. Okay. I'll make you the biggest screen.  Okay. Yes. Nice. So this is the first time I'm doing this. So thank you for being up for it.  And basically, well, I'm trying to experiment with creating like video case studies where I interview people that work together.  at the end, I'll probably maybe cut some of the times where I do. But I'll always show you the the version and we can adjust things if you're not happy with it.  Okay. Thank you. Thank you for being always so so optimistic about this stuff. So, okay, let's do this. The work we've done together, we've done two things together now, but I thought about focusing this  on the visual framework stuff. Is that okay with you?

4:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Everything's okay with me. Good, good.

4:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I have my iPad next to me with some questions to remind me. So just to get us a little bit of context.  When we, you found me through LinkedIn and something clicked and you said, oh, I need to speak to this guy, right?  Do you remember that moment?

4:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, let's go back to, let's go back in time. But I think I was just trying to create something nice for my community.  I was trying to digitalize myself and I was just trying to see the best talent out there that could help me out, get this done.  I don't actually remember how I got to you but I was looking into a visual thinking and visual design and branding and I was throwing my attention through these kind of dimensions and trying to see where can I go to really bring out the best of my abilities or my vision into reality.  I thought about I need to create maybe something tangible. I need to people how can I show the value of my expertise of what I know what I have discovered into something that people can feel in touch and something you know they can sense you know yeah so that's how I end up in the concept of framework and I'm like well wait let's try and search for framework thinking we have this thinking future thinking so I stumbled upon on framework thinking so okay let's search framework thinking  frameworks, and framework design, and all of these things. And I think that's how I, in my rabbit hole, end up with you.  Nice, nice.

6:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for the detail. I've noticed that this thing of a confidence that what we know is valuable, but at that pain point of making it sure that other people can understand what that is, right?  That's how I interpret what you're telling me. And going back even a little bit further, do you remember moments before we were working together, But we're like, yeah, this person is not getting what I'm saying.  Because I need another way of communicating this. Do you remember stuff like this?

6:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think you always. got me because you had this kind of mindset and framework of thinking and structure that it's just about extracting my intellectual information so we can structure it in a way.  So you had like, you were like these robotic arms taking information of my consciousness and mindset to really put it in a structure that could serve a purpose and put it in a way that it's visually appealing for me and for others.  I didn't find a moment when you didn't get me. I always felt like we were in sync. That's great to hear.

7:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the things that I really I really enjoyed in our process. So we spoke like, I think four times for 90 minute sessions.  And we began with some structure, but then you had this, you're very comfortable with the creative process and exploring things.  So eventually we realized that we didn't need to be tied down to that structure, but it was just useful, like suppose in a landscape, we should be around here.  And that process for me was really interesting, because we were really doing it at the same time, right? We were thinking about post-its and the ideas, then it was with the iPad and just scribbling, and you got that really fast.  And one of the things that I remember from that time was when we started to find different ways of saying the same thing, like different visual frameworks for the same sort of idea, but from different perspectives.  How was this very like, the noticing that, there's this thing I know that the best way of explaining it for this audience is with this sort of image, but for this audience the same concept can be explained with a different kind of image, right?  you remember going through this with me?

9:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, and it seems that we really need to understand who is our user because it depends in how we're going to show them the information, know, like I know that with the unconscious mind the symbolic images are going to have a profound impact in each individual, but it's different if we put like just a normal graphic to if we put like a stick, like this, like the sticky, the  voice right yeah stick figures yeah it's the stick figures right so it's it's different the way that people really understand what i love about visual thinking it's you know like it's immersing in information but not just in the logical mind but with the creative mind it's like through the through the frameworks we create like a hemisync in a way so people really get the information really though but yes i saw the difference you know like and one of my thinking was like how how do i choose or do i pick the right one you know and at the end i i told myself maybe it's just a prototype and and we need to show it off and maybe we can make it better or optimize it or change it you know but we need to start with something you know so the best thing is just to finalize with one uh framework visual framework that it's going to to  to work?

11:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but now you've touched on something that I think not a lot of people mention when we talk about frameworks, which is the fact that you need to test them, right?  Test them with other people to see how people get it. So after we did the work and you did some other, you did some retreats and you've worked with some of the clients, did you have the opportunity to experiment with some of them, to show them, to see how people reacted to them?

11:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, I actually did a retreat in Costa Rica and I did one of, I did two frameworks, like the final one, and yes, and another one it was, I think it was kind of like the security.

11:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have the frameworks here.

12:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  they had a security one, yes, and people really got the idea of what I was actually explaining, you know, and the funnel, you know, people understood, you know, like what they really need to do to be here, you know, to be part of this retreat, you know, so this is the first time I was, you know, during the workshop, I was explaining the visual framework, and they were really loving, they were like, oh, can I take a picture, can you please send us this information, or, you know, I have people that this is the second or third retreat that they're coming with me, but I never did that before, and they're like, okay, this is this is just amazing, and the results are just, you know, like, over all the experience, you know, beyond the frameworks, and things like that, it was so far the best product ever I thought, like, people  but actually love the Costa Rica experience. I think the framework, the visual framework, the visual thinking, workshop, the kind of experience, it was just mental, you know, people really love it.  So I knew that I had to do this framework thing with you. I don't know if it was destiny or something, but we did it, you know, like, it's incredible.  Yeah.

13:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I had a lot of fun doing it. And I think one of the things he said just a few minutes ago, that I think you phrased it in a very nice way, which is that the frameworks, they are kind of like a bridge between a very structured mind and a more very rational line and a very creative mind, right?  They speak both languages, right? So I never phrased that in that way in my mind. And I think this is a beautiful sentence that I think I'll reuse it, I can attribute it to you.  But that connection between in, you know, the right side and the left side of the brain. I never know which one is the creative one.  I always get that. But you get the picture. And this is really good that you also that you've also had the opportunity to experiment and test them out and see how people react to them, right?  This is great. And did you, did you find opportunities for improving them and like, oh, I like many things about this one.  But not that I've shown it to people. I want to improve these aspects.

14:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, of course, what I love about the framework thing is that, you know, once you land a framework, it's, you know, like, this is, this is my land, you know, like, we could be doing lots of things and work with the infinity.  And we never end. But when you land a framework, it's, know, like, this is the constraints. I'm going to put my creativity and my attention  So when days go by, I go back to the frameworks in the mirror and I look at them and I say like, what can I change?  maybe can I add something? Or can I take away something? it's like, the framework is just, it's like my own canvas and I can work with that canvas.  And I can optimize that canvas and I can redesign that canvas where I work through that canvas. So I understood that also into my way of thinking that the limits, people think about the leaves system, we have limits, they're okay if you know how to work with them because you need to live inside of the limits, through the limits, with the limits, in and out of the limits, but you need to understand the limits.  the frameworks are the limits. And I have so much on, you know, like we have this framework of the journey of the experience of the  exploration and all the faces and I'm just looking at you know like in this phase we could change the piece or maybe we could add this technique or maybe what happens if we add this tool or imagine it instead of going in through the experience in this immersion in this phase with this attitude what happens if I add this attitude you know so I'm also you know changing techniques abilities skills and agility is all of these things you know but I work inside of it so it's amazing it's fun and it's it's kind of a game it is kind of a game my own way of looking at it is that it's a mix between you know making frameworks is a mix between expertise like your expertise the expertise of the subject matter systems because they help you navigate this web of connections and ideas and concepts and fun because it's just the fun is kind of the the few

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you keep, oh my god, this is a really good idea, I like it. And I want the next good idea, and I want to change this previous idea into another one that's more interesting even.  So for me, I'm thinking of it like a framework in my mind, those three circles intersecting. I cannot avoid it, I think you understand what I mean.

17:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But it's like, you know, you have the football field, you know, and you put soccer players in it, and you're always going to be a witness of magic, you know.  If you put Cristiano Ronaldo, maybe he scores in a way, but the next day he scores in another interesting way, and maybe the next day he does another crazy thing, you know, and you are always surprised by the different kind of goals that soccer players can make.  They're always inside the soccer field, you know, and it's like that is a framework. like it surprised me, know, like what you can find out or what you can explore and discover inside your frame branch.  The framework is like your own lens of perception to work in the space.

18:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, absolutely. I remember you've used that analogy on one of our conversations that he said something like, yeah, if you just have like a pitch of grass and there's no lines on it, it's no fun.  It becomes fun when you create the field, the boundaries, the court anyway. Yeah, really good. Let me see. So let me see if I don't forget anything because I want to get as much enthusiasm from you as I can.  so during the process we've described, like we had a few meetings and during that sequence of conversations, like from us, you know, sending you the proposal and the whole thing,  Was there anything that stood out to you like a specific moment that you're like, oh, this was a good idea to hire this guy was a moment like that at some point?

19:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Well, since I read your blogs on soft stack. I knew this guy knows what he's talking about, you know, and, you know, it's been a hard time for me, you know, like, I'm hearing that you can turn Mexico.  It's been hard for me to really get in touch with people that take the way I do or, you know, like, they want to spend your creativity and they love design and they love innovation and they just want to collaborate and things like that.  as I was researching and I found some interesting people, I contacted you. And what I love about you is that you reply super, super fast in a way.  So I'm like, okay, he's open to it, you know, like he's. close like we made a connection okay so let's continue and let's see where it goes and I was ready you know I I was ready to to make contact I was ready to uh to be helped you know I want the help and I and I knew you were the kind of guy that uh wanted to help others so no so so you say okay let's go to the meeting we got to a meeting and since I got to know you and since that first meeting it was like an instant match you know it's because uh we were have that kind of the not just the same mindset but also we have likes in books in common and you know there were some interesting match things and and I know it was it was a no-brainer decision you know like you know as I said before  I don't know if it was Destiny or something, but I knew you were my kind of guy for this kind of project, you know, because I didn't know what I was creating or what I wanted to create.  I just knew that I need frameworks, you know, and when I saw people doing like big presentations, you know, if we see Tony Robbins, Robin Sharma, see Dan Sulivan, all of these big players, you know, doing great things.  It's because they have frameworks, you know, they have this framework of thinking. It's not just about, oh, read my book.  No, they have this, the will of something, the graphic of this, you know, the four levels of that, you know, and I'm like, I didn't understand it yet before, but I knew like they have a map for the knowledge to show other people.  So when I got that idea, I was like, okay, I need my own frameworks. So when I went to you, I knew that I  And this is the type of guide that I need. This is the word that I need right now, and this is going to take my consulting work to the next level.

22:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Now, this is amazing. And it's true, right? I mean, to me, I always look at this framework thing a lot like a meme, because a meme is made for distribution, right?  You just make an image with a funny text or something. And then you send it out into the world, and some people will react to it.  Some people will not understand it. It depends. But it is something that people can send around, right? And in my mind, when you put your expertise into a framework, you're putting your mind into a meme-able format.  You can go out into the world. And yes, I think we look at this thing from the same perspective.  It's a tool, a framework is a tool to give legs to your... inside right or wings maybe so it gives authority to your knowledge in a way you know like it's you know it gives what can you repeat like authority oh yeah yeah yeah exactly because it also I mean we know that the process of coming up with these things it's a creative process so it's not very linear at some points we're like oh I'm trying this I want to go back to this version because this version was better then you will learn something so it's a very creative and looping process right and we know that there's behind a simple image there's a lot of discussion and reflection and all of this thing but also when we see these simple images on a book that we respect or on a reference that we care about they just simplify the entire discussion is just like look the best  For the best of the author's knowledge, the simple way of looking at, I don't know, any specific problem is this shape.  And this shape is something you can memorize, right?

24:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, yeah.

24:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, simplicity is a lot of work. think that's the lesson here for me.

24:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think there's only 26 letters in the alphabet. But there's so much information in just bringing that into symbolic imagery.  I don't know, but when I have a book, I understand more in the book through one simple framework that through all of the entire documentation of what does it mean.  know, because a lot of the book writing is just to give you kind of references to what are they trying to tell you.  But the framework goes beyond belief, it's, know, this is it, you know, it's, you know, integrate that visual framework, that symbolic thing in your brain and your being, and it's just more impactful than just reading a bunch of letters and stuff, you know.  There's something powerful in imagery. Yeah, yeah.

25:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've always liked maps and stuff like that. and I've noticed a lot of people, when I bring it up, when I bring up the topic of maps, I've noticed that a lot of people find them very interesting as well.  So that's book that you're telling me about. In a way, it's a little bit like, is the legend of the map, right?  There's a map, and then there's a hundred pages that are just about how to read the map, right? Which is, it really goes to show, like, when people  sure a thousand words that kind of thing. So Jorge, this is great to get this insight into how it felt to you and the value you got from it.  And let me see if I didn't forget anything because we get excited, we always get excited with these conversations.  Yeah, I think these were the questions I had. mean, let's just record a little segment that I'll bring to the beginning of this, where I explain your business because I think it's important to have that in the video.  Then we edit and reverse it. So actually, maybe the best way is if I ask you like, could you describe your business and then I put that part in the video.  Jorge, can you tell us a little bit about your business?

26:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, yes, my business is kind of a psychedelic innovation consulting. I do retreats all the more and I'm just here to help people go to beyond their potential, you know.  So what I really do with my business is just be this psychedelic GPS or ecosystem that helps people understand the psychedelic world and the territory, you know.  And with that, I need frameworks and maps to teach people how to navigate the spaces and bring the psychedelic insights into actionable steps that they can contribute to change their behavior.

27:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and you've, one of the things that you've mentioned is that in our conversations is that this mix between psychedelic innovation, consulting, not just the exploration, also the integration phase.  You've mentioned the integration phase time and time again. This is something that is getting more attention out there in the world, right?  Because there's like more established or blue-cheap initiatives around this today, right?

28:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, well, lots of people know psychedelics through this bad label, you know, that they were for hippies, or they are for drug users, or crazy people, or it's just for traumatic purposes, you need to go to Peru or Brazil and do ayahuasca, or maybe we have this new lens, you know, that it's the clinical therapeutic aspect that how they're doing it in the USA, that it's through this medical lens.  But we need to go beyond that, you know, there's like actually lenses that we can use psychedelics, the spiritual and tegenic way, that it's the shamanic way, then it's the recreative way, like we do it for race, for parties, for music scene.  And we have the therapeutic way or the medical way, the clinical way, you know, like where we have a structure of protocols versus we don't have protocols.  The creative way and the spiritual way is just more about the spiritual aspect of, oh, I'm the one connected with everything.  We are all one and like that. But hey, you're still a human being. You're in a planet Earth. You need to earn money.

29:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You need to do things.

29:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So what I'm trying to do with my business is, you know, if we have this design lens and we have this innovation processes that actually work to grow our businesses, what could we do or how might we make a better ecosystem if we integrate the innovation processes and the same principles into psychedelic insights, you know?  Like what might happen if we do that, you know? So this is where I come in and integrate that.  my work, it's not just the focus or the content of the experience, because when... you open up yourself and as a psychedelic experience a lot of people get lost in the impact of the experience like wow this is amazing but then you come back you come down of the Everest and you need to work again you know it's like you see everything and that's it no okay you see everything but not what and my my attention goes to you know this other process it's not about the content it's about the process you know so my board it's mainly about creating methodologies and creating these frameworks that people can really work through psychedelics but to have some results in mind you know it's an outcome oriented way it's experience oriented you know because that's what it is happening in psychedelic renaissance with the clinical framework and recreating framework and the spiritual framework so what I'm trying to do is really let's do a professional development we need to  oriented, results oriented. need to be results driven, you know, so this is where I come and this is where I do.

31:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's an interesting place to be given that the tide is rising and you see all the the way people are talking about this is changing and evolving and getting much more sophisticated, right?

31:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And people want new experiences and it's okay, you know, people just want to get it out of their corporate lifestyle, you know, like it's like they have two lives, you know, their personal life and the professional life, you know, and when it's not connected to the other one, but what I want to do is try to reconnect them.  There's this new TV show called Severeance by Ben Stiller that it shows about, you know, how people are disconnected, you know, you need to disconnect yourself from your personal life, professional life.  What I'm trying to do with this work is, you know, let's reintegrate that person into one being and you know like how can you create a new business model you know in a way so that's how I want to approach the psychedelic space and the psychedelic world to really help people reintegrate themselves into life you know not not escape reality you know don't escape to your spiritual self you know you don't have to go to the malayas you need to come back to your community you know yeah yeah yeah come back to the treasure do something with it um this was this was great I mean I I always like talking to you so I have no more questions just happy to to chat and uh yeah I thank you I mean that's that's it perfect we did it we did hopefully it went good you know I tried my best no I could I could see that you

33:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  who are trying to, you know, introduce naturally in the, because you've seen the document, you've seen the document of the case, like, subtle ways of things that I could use.  So thank you for that. That was very kind. Sometimes people don't understand the value of a case study or a testimonial.  They just say like normal stuff, but you understand the value and you're like, I'm going to help João. So I've noticed that.

33:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  thank you for that. Yes, of course, I'm, we're here to help. And I know you have so, such an amazing talent and work in your hands and people are really need to, to go with you.  And I really want to share more of you. But once I launch my new project, know, like, because the project is coming, people are going to ask like, how did you do it?  And then I'm going to hurry and people to go with you because I have lots of people, you know, I'm teaching coach.  you know and the coaches need their own frameworks you know in a way uh there's there's going to be people coming into you but the thing is that most of them they don't speak English so that's that's going to be a barrier but I'm gonna have practice more Spanish but let's what happens and you know like you know actually actually you know I did the the framework but just kind of writing you know like I have my my my uh my board and and I wrote it down and and they were like taking pictures things but if I they see it digitally when I have the brand they think oh it's going to be so fabulous you know and I changed the six six weeks training course to I'm going to launch a school community you know the school community it's going to be a membership and they're going to have access to these frameworks to have I developed this new thanks to the framework their integration  on business canvas or like kind of the business model canvas but actually you know it's you know like it's going to be your integration management canvas you know like who are your key partners you know what are your key resources like what are you going to do with these psychedelic insights what are you going to change you know and people are going to work with that for six weeks and they need to every week just change things from canvas i'm just so excited about this you know and and they're going to give me the brand on the 28 and with that in mind i already did i understood also that you know what separates an expert from a knowledge entrepreneur is the knowledge entrepreneur knows how to do a briefing and a briefing is you know giving instructions of your vision into the design team you know because a lot of people have the vision and that's something that i also learned from you that you know  my perspective it's my perspective you know and sometimes I get a lot that people are going to see my perspective but it's impossible because that's my perspective and the framework it's kind of like but it's going to help them align to my perspective you know so the briefing process is you know it's how I can bring down that vision so the design team can put that into a visual design and they see like what I'm seeing you know like kind of a steep just what he did with the with the Apple ecosystem he saw it but what changed the worry that he does he did the actual briefing you know and you need to do this you know and yeah I don't know how you're gonna do it you know and it's I understand that it's the briefing part the briefing I never thought about that but I think makes a lot of sense because unless you have a way of as an expert unless you have a way of you know talking to other people that will help you with different things  you'll keep feeling like oh they don't get me they don't get me i need these guys to understand what i'm saying and they don't understand it and that's very frustrating that's a very interesting point the power of the briefing of knowing how to breathe yeah it's kind of uh if we go to the mystical side it's what the difference between a psychotic and a mystic you know in the keys language you know the mystic knows how to express what he's experiencing and psychotic is like i don't know what's happening you know oh that's a very okay okay yeah you get me that in language is the briefing you know it's how can you communicate you know and it's leadership it's collaboration that's the it's that's the key to team alignment to visual consulting everything and i understood that with my ketamine trips these past days uh-huh because i'm thinking about another project i i'm joining in i'm working on right now and that's exact
