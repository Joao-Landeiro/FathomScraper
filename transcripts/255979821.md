0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no worries, no worries. How's it going? Good. How about you? What time is it there?

0:09 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  2.30 in the afternoon.

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How about you? 2.30. It's 6.30 in the afternoon. OK.

0:16 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  So you're a little bit later than me. Yeah.

0:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah.

0:24 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Remind me again, I I know you do kind of workshop design sort of stuff, right?

0:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yeah, tell me more about, like, what way are we having this conversation? Well, it's like, yeah, more of what you do.

0:40 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  mean, I'm genuinely interested in just kind of your specialty is. Sure.

0:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. So very quickly, I help experts create their own workshops. the reason why I. I do that and why I like doing that and I've been doing that is that I came to Brazil, I'm not Brazilian, I'm Portuguese, but I came to Brazil to work with innovation consulting at the time.  I went to school for design and at the time this was 12 years ago. It was a lot about designing thinking and workshops and stuff like that.  And so I got exposed to it during an interesting time and I saw that they worked. But also I could see that then people start having poor experiences with workshops like HR, cringe, activities, team building stuff that doesn't really...  that was really frustrating to me because it was like the principles of this create space and time for structured collaboration.  This is really good stuff and we are running out of simple problems to solve and this is useful for the complex stuff.  And I got really interested in the topic of expertise as a whole. I love the book, the business of expertise and other things, nerdier things on that realm.  And I was like, I love to mix both of these things. And I can run workshops. I can see that they are helpful for knowledge work.  And I think a lot of experts are starting to find themselves in this place that they're just diagnosed and prescribed method, which used to be the way of doing like consulting and knowledge work, is not working so much more because clients are more discerning.  Information is free, infinite and instantaneous. It shifts a little bit. So that's my thesis. AI just accelerated that. But I don't like to talk about AI all the time because it feels like I'm just chasing some shiny thing.  But yeah, it's true. And that's what I do. and I came across your stuff, I think because I was looking on purpose into people that help professional services market themselves better.  So that's how I started to see your stuff. Then I think you had a notion resource that you said to me, it was really good.  yeah. A notion or maybe on the kids. Maybe you just keep to distribute it, but it was a notion I don't remember exactly.  Yeah, I think which one you're talking about.

3:33 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  It's probably, if I had to guess, I see.

3:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe I can find it. Is it, does it look like this? Yes, I think that's it. Yes. Okay. Yeah.

3:56 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, it's mainly just like work your way through the. different sorts of questions, you know, plug in some of your own information, and then kind of it, the idea is it'll spit out kind of what you need to do next based off of how you answer things earlier on.

4:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't put the whole information there, so I didn't get the spit-out thing. I just wanted to be transparent on that.  But I remember I liked the authority it was. also felt, I think, the thornness. Maybe that's it. I think the thornness also made me feel like, this is serious, I should reserve some time for this.  And then I think I didn't get around to it, which makes me feel bad. You don't want to lie about it.  That's all good. But so yeah, basically, that's me. And I told you that I found your posts, well, on the surface level, I think they're stylish.  I like the style, I like the They're understated, but even your site there's a lot of text, but I see that as a good thing like people that write a lot usually communicate really clearly, and I didn't feel lost on your website.  So that thing also caught my eye. And then at some point I was like, yeah, maybe we should meet.  And also, for me, I'm really like, I should talk to people that serve my market. I think I do a different thing, but we are probably serving the same kind of people at different stages.  And I think you have a much more strategic brother, like, serious, let's say. It's not my favorite word thing around it, but I was like, I should introduce myself and I should try to learn from you and other professional services marketers.  Well, that's flattering.

5:57 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  mean, I feel like I still have plenty to learn myself. So yeah, I mean, thanks for saying that, but it's true.  mean, mean, it's well, I mean, honestly, for me, it's just been this has been the same sort of thing that I've been, you know, breathing for the last 10 plus years.  And so it's it's just kind of what I notice what I've seen. And so really, I'm just trying to speak from experience and try to, you know, provide some insight and value up front so that maybe people who are who kind of need what I know on a more like personalized basis that like they can maybe we can work together or figure out some way that I can help them more formally.  in general, I like, you know, I like meeting people. I like learning from people, know, like I do this  podcast you've probably seen or like interview show on LinkedIn and you know like there's one facet of that where it's like I'm building new relationships some of those people become clients but a lot of it is just like market research and me just kind of like broadening out my understanding of the pains and the solutions that a lot of people in my target market are currently employing and so you know I can find out you know oh looks like 90% of my target market is getting new business through referrals rather than you know anything proactive or you know oh there seems to be a higher propensity towards events you know or conferences right now you know like I can kind of be learning that stuff just by talking to folks at a regular cadence and so it's been really helpful for that but yeah well I mean  I mean, are there any particular things that I can where I can be helpful or I can answer questions or yeah, where you think it makes sense for us to kind of, you know, further, anything like that.

8:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I do see a couple of ways, but I think for now, honestly, and maybe this is a little bit of self serving, but I have like questions around.  Okay, so this is my I'm going to share with you my thesis on this, right? I'm interested in your perspective because if you saw this market, I didn't know that it was for 10 years, but you can see on the testimonials on the depth of the writing that you have a perspective on this, right?  Which is really important. And so one of one of the things I wrote here on my questions was is agencies, they always seem to me  to be on this kind of transition moment, right? Market is changing, clients are in-housing things, expecting things than with AI, faster, cheaper, that kind of thing.  And the feeling I have is that the floor is lava. So whatever is near the bottom is going away.  And then you need to climb up to, so the tide is rising, floor is lava. think you picked an analogy you prefer, but just a need to move up markets quick.  And there's aspects of that that I think are a little bit more obvious, like perhaps the way the materials are the way they introduce themselves, that is more aesthetic layer.  But then I also feel like there's an aspect of moving up markets. This is, okay, so this is something I'm not sure is...  and it's a sense that some of these things about moving up market also mean a different kind of relationship and a more I think max trailer talks about consultative or facilitative kind of dialogue shoulder to shoulder solving a thing right right is this roughly accurate like is this the feeling that people need to go up market but there are skills about operating in that level that they don't have yet I mean I think some of it is skills they don't have some of it's they have the skills but they are not maybe reading the market well to realize like I know sometimes it's almost like they're in this sort of reactive or like order taking sort of mode especially in the dev agency world it's like they think oh well the only time somebody needs our services if they've decided oh we need a python development

11:00 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  and see and so we're going to find somebody who you know code specifically in python to build our You know our digital product or something and in reality like If if you're just waiting for people who have like a very broad pain point like that uh Yeah, you might get a lot of leads, but you're also going to be in a kind of a bucket where you're solving the same You're able to solve Problems on the same level that many other agencies that also work with python camp, you know, so it's like oh, you don't stand out at all and so I think More agencies need to be I guess always aware of the constant kind of like what you were saying the Essentially, there's there's always commoditization.  There's always a commoditization type force on Agencies So, you know, whatever you think you do That is unique and innovative  on the execution side, people are going to find out ways to execute in a faster, more efficient way. so, if all you're doing for people is execution, there's a risk that that could be cannibalized, right?  You know, if you're a content marketing agency and all you sell yourself as is we write long-form blog posts for people who need them, you know, and you tell us what you want and we'll create it for you.  Well, great, but now that AI can write a bunch, you know, like, you know, are you out of a job now?  But if you are the agency that has a particular point of, like, maybe works with a specific industry, has a particular point of view on what works and what doesn't work, using content to achieve an outcome of, like, you know, driving more revenue for your business.  and you have a certain framework for how your content that you know how to produce does that. All of a sudden, you're a lot more interesting than just using AI.  Like somebody is now thinking, well, do I use AI to write my content or do I talk to these experts who know exactly what content I should write and how I should edit the generated content?  They know what stuff in particular I'm going to need to write. Specifically to achieve this goal that our agency or that our business has.  So, you know, you get how like you change the conversation from just like kind of a lower skill. We're just turning out content to knowing what content to actually produce.  And I think more agencies especially, well, and I think part of the problem is. If they've been serving a wide range of clients, know, if they're like.  We have 10 different industries that we work with you can do that when you're providing a commodity service like when you're providing Development you can be a little more one-size-fits-all But you're you're putting yourself at risk of Of the sort of cannibalizing forces of the market where it's like if you're if you're at the bottom of the market on execution that can be You know the the advantage you have can be erased pretty quickly, so I think I think more agencies need to lean into What they do best like really really thinking hard about what they do best Doubling down there You know identifying specific outcomes that they can drive like oh we can help revenue we can help growth We can help efficiency, you know, whatever it is.  There's usually some like core Outcomes that that agencies can help drive and then like lead with like what's their methodology like show their work like you know it can't just be like this box where it's like just trust us we have a way of of helping drive that outcome it's like no like we can we're not going to give you all the nitty gritty because that's not going to be helpful to give you like all the details but we can give you like a high level like step one step two step three and step four and this is what goes into those general steps and that's how we get from where you are to where you want to be you know it's like enough that people their ideal clients can wrap their heads around it and be like yeah you know this agency has worked with people like me they've achieved outcomes for people like me and they have a methodology for how they consistently do that like that's going to build a lot more trust and make it much more likely  that somebody is going to want to work with them, know? Like, especially, you know, if there's any sort of recently high cost involved, you know, that the cheaper something is, you know, people might be like, well, it's only 500 bucks, you know, I can risk it.  But, you know, if it's, you know, you're talking about $50,000, it's like, okay, we want to do a little bit more due diligence up front to make sure that we're making the right decision.  one of things I advocate for is this goes into like the productization side of things. And I've actually gotten some validation from the conversations that I've had.  But doing some sort of, I think more dev agencies need to get better at providing sort of a, maybe a workshop or a  a short, predefined and like fixed price smaller engagement up front that helps their audience validate that they're going to be building the right thing because I think a lot of times what happens is they think in terms of look if somebody wants to build something we're just going to be an order taker they tell us what they want to build we'll tell them how long it's going to take and how much it's going to cost then we start building it and then they're going to tell us oh we changed our mind we want to go to this thing and the scope is going to change a lot and so that's why we only charge hourly blah blah blah blah blah when in reality if it's like okay this is our vision and it's like okay cool great vision let's put together some high fidelity markups then we're going to find some people who are in your target market we're going to do some like user testing with that initial  like that wireframe or that mock-up to get feedback from the market, like the people you're targeting, let's see how they like it, see what their feedback is, and get some of that vetting done when it's not, you know, like a fully developed working prototype, but getting a lot of the sort of big problems solved when it's in the early stages.  So you can learn at that point, like are we building the right thing? it's just like, you you want to know that you're building the right thing, like, you know, say your budget, you know, you not even know your budget, but you're like, do you want to spend $250,000 and realize you spent, you know, like $50,000 of that was kind of thrown away because you had to change the directions significantly partway through versus, oh, you know what, we actually did all that hard work up front, we validated exactly what we should be building.  And we got the MVP basically fully designed before we even started development. And that reduced the costs, the risks.  We had an audience that we could go to immediately following and knew that there was a much higher likelihood that it's going to connect and grow.  you see if you're an agency, a dev agency, or actually, I should say, if you're a potential client of a dev agency, that sort of upfront offer is going to be much more appealing to you because it's going to reduce the risk of you spending too much or building the wrong thing.  And it's probably going to be appealing to investors and things like that as well, because investors don't want to spend a bunch of money and then find out, oh, you know what, you guys spent all that money.  But you've had to pivot three times because the market doesn't actually need what you're building. So many such cases.

20:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I feel like I'm getting out of soapbox a little bit there.

20:07 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  no, it's interesting.

20:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it doesn't make sense. And I've been, I mean, I've worked in product. I was a product manager for a while.  recently I've also worked in kind of, kind of a product manager fractional sort of thing. my background is design.  So I understand what you mean. I've been involved in like digital projects. there's some, and now that the people usually, there's a famous quote about the beginning of that book, the Anna Kanina, I never read it, that says all the happy families are happy in the same way, but the unhappy families are unhappy in their own specific ways.  So it's interesting that when things fail, sometimes they fail for very specific. reasons like I don't know maybe the founder didn't know what they didn't know they were just too green for this kind of thing or your stubborn stubborn founders are kind of a common pattern and so it makes a lot of sense to me it totally clicks I do have like questions I would like to drill down into like this so I might just list them so the first one is we don't need to to dive right in but the first one I would like to understand is like from your perspective as a as an expert that helps you know the agencies what what are the signs that give you a sense of okay it's going to be a good kind that it's possible to do good work for them another question is what do you think is different because to me it sense to serve the agency world but I'm also understanding a little bit more of like there's a lot of different ages  And there's a common branch on how they operate, but there's specificities. And I'd like to understand a little bit more of what's different about dev agencies.  And finally, I would like to understand a little bit more if, also from the perspective of trying to be useful, it's like, if there's anything about your work that you find that's usually challenging, they don't get this thing, I tried to explain it, they don't see it, something like that.  So just to recap, what do the good ones have in common? What's different about dev agencies? And what's something that's difficult about the job that you do?  You can pick anything you want. I'll try to answer them one at a time.

22:44 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  sorry, the first one you said was I did it.

22:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The good ones, what do the good ones have in common? Your clients, the good clients, you did it.

22:55 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Honestly, I would say they are. They're open to doing new things. I know that seems kind of like obvious maybe, I had one client that churned that we would have regular meetings, we got a lot of the strategy mapped out, and then it was like, okay, well, now we need to execute on these things.  This is a coaching client. It's like, okay, well, here's what we need to do before the next meeting, and then the next meeting would come around.  I'm thinking, okay, I'm going to start getting into the next thing we need to do. But first, I'm going to see how far they made it.  It's like, oh, yeah, they got busy. We didn't really do any of that stuff. Yeah, we'll try to do it this week.  Basically, they were spending money with me, but they were... They just weren't executing on their end and so like there's only so much you can do when people are like You know, they're paying you but but they can't Follow through Sorry, sir.  Did your spider sense tingle when you first met them and you're like this guy's gonna be trouble No, I mean honestly it was the opposite They seem like they're pretty like open-minded, but I think they're I think early on Any engagement there is times where it was like I'd be like, okay So this is you know one aspect and they kind of thought of themselves as like the exception Like oh, yeah, we can see how like other people other agencies would need to do that, but I think we're different so like Yeah, we're not interested in doing that particular, you know facet of of your Your approach, you know and then other times of you like yeah, well, I think you know, we don't need to do it that way and  it was almost like they they pushed back on the stuff that I was saying and I was like you know you guys can do whatever you want but like I'm working from not only my 10 years of expert like experience but also talking to tons of other agencies as well and so like this is you my framework is not made in a vacuum there's a lot of you know whether it's qualitative or quantitative data there's there's there's data to back it up and so but you know you can you can say that sort of stuff till you're blue in the face but if people aren't honestly I think what it was is I ended up being a lower priority um and it's like a lot of the stuff that I like it needs to be a high priority for your agency to to want to  invest in kind of your your growth engine your pipeline systems and so I think that's that's where it broke down is just maybe maybe not prioritizing it sufficiently.

26:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I had a client actually we're still finishing on some stuff so I technically I still have that client really nice person but I get super defensive every time I suggest something and it's like I'm I'm not saying you did wrong I'm just like there's this thing we could try I like no but I'm trying that other thing is like and it's so difficult because once people get into that mind space like they feel that they need to defend themselves or that they're not open to like they're theoretically open but they're not really open it's it's really frustrating it felt to me it's really frustrating like you don't need to defend yourself I didn't say  This person should be, I think, putting gasoline on the fire, but just felt very unproductive. Like, why are you begging me?  Because I'm telling you these things, and I know these things make sense. was like, yeah, the thing you said about feeling that, like, the exception run really true to me.  Like, oh, that's an anti-signal. Yeah. It's like, if you think of an exception, that's a thing.

27:24 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, I think, in some ways, I think of myself as like an editor, somebody who's like, if you think in terms of writing, somebody who's seen a lot of writing, and they know where the problems tend to come up, and who can be like, oh, you know what?  I think this angle needs to change. We need to break this up in the style of what you're writing.  It's like, I'm not coming in and saying, you know, oh, you're a terrible writer or something like that. More of just, OK, let's punch this up a notch.  Like, let's make this even better than what it is. And I think... My other clients who've been a great fit, I think almost universally, they're regularly sharing stuff with me and being like, hey, you give me feedback on this, you give me feedback on this.  Like they want feedback. And so I think they have this mindset of, you know, this is why you're here to like to make us stronger and better by giving us, Frank, an honest feedback.  And some people, maybe it's just, you know, maybe their egos wrapped up in it or, yeah, in this one client's case, like they had an idea of what I was going to be bringing to the table and it ended up being different.  Like I thought I was, you know, very clear about it. But I guess I could see where, if they thought maybe  of like marketing as this sort of add-on, rather than something that's like, you know, kind of important to the to the actual fabric of your business, like it's an extension of your business strategy.  And that in order for us to figure out marketing, we're going to have to figure out business strategy together or like, you know, at least discuss and refine it.  I think what I do is not just kind of a bolt-on to what you're already doing. I'm going to be asking you rethink some fundamental things.  And if you're open to that, you know, we're going to have a good relationship and we're going to get results.

29:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can really, I think that's the vein of marketing, People having like all these word? I don't know. It's like they have the wrong idea about marketing is like preconceived notions or something.

30:07 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Perfect, preconceived notions.

30:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And like poorly made preconceived notions, right? So I was talking earlier today, I was talking to a guy here from Brazil, from my city, and he has a branding agency.  And he has had his agency for a long time. They have won awards, they were regarded, they do good work to get clients, good clients.  And one of the things that he was mentioning was part of what they do is branding, right? And he said there's a part of branding that people get, which is the logos and the colors and the fonts.  And there's a part of it that they don't get, right? And he said, which is like the tone of voice or this is the sort of event you should run or this, I'll, this is  how you should greet people when they arrive at your restaurant, you know, like these sorts of things. he says, these things people don't get, especially because it serves larger companies.  He said at the lower levels, they really don't get it. want really concrete stuff. Like what are you delivering?  What's the output in terms of files at the end of this? Yeah. If you manage to get up the ladder, then you start to find some people that are a little more comfortable thinking in abstractions, approximations, analogies, and so on.  But he said, yeah, branding is a little bit, yeah, two worlds in one. People get the surface level thing, but they don't get the other things.  And I was like, how do you make them understand? And he said, we just show pieces of work, and we know that people will latch on to the visual stuff.  But we always sell the new work based on the previous work. And he was not happy with this. was like, I wish I could sell it on the ID.  on the thinking behind it. But we don't have a method. Anyway, so that's the thing. So, okay, this is really interesting.  Thank you very, very good stuff. in terms of Dev agencies, what are like some things that are really, people from outside that world, they might not realize, but we've been serving Dev agencies for a while.  What's like something that's a bit unique about Dev agencies compared to other kinds of agencies?

32:33 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  The thing that I think probably has made it easier for me to work with them rather than other types of, at least marketing agencies, is like, I'll talk with prospects in a marketing agency and they'll nod their heads and they'll agree with all the things that I'm saying about like the common problems, know, the framework for like fixing them all makes sense.  I'll ask for some stuff. it gets to the end of the conversation and it's like those all sound like great things and we should definitely implement those but they say well we're like we're we're a marketing agency so we should be able to do that ourselves you know like I think it's almost like there's like sense of like embarrassment where it's like if we hire somebody else outside then like how how good marketers are we if we have to hire outside marketer to help us with our own marketing and on in contrast like you talk with a bunch of engineers and they're like we can build stuff we're really good at building stuff but like that right brain creative marketing stuff like that's not our wheels and so they're much more like we know what we don't know and marketing is one of those things and so like please please help us with that and I would say that you know  The other like that's not universal. There are some marketing agencies. In fact, I have one client who's He's a marketing agency and You know is very like open to Learning and and Like that sort of sort of feedback so he doesn't have That same sort of hang up But I just I noticed that as I had a lot of conversations with different marketing agency folks There is a lot of like agreement in what I was saying But it was a really like it seemed like it was a big leap for them to go from I need this To I want to take the next step and actually Be free to help with it.  Yeah And I I'm just like I was trying to connect the dots and I think it is just like You know we're a marketing agency.  We should be able to do this ourselves like we do it for our clients And I think part of the problem is there's this misunderstanding it like b2b  marketing or e-com marketing is, you know, that it's largely the same and you can just do a lot of the same things in order to make it work for your agency.  And I think it's, it's significantly different. Like, you know, people talk about B2B versus B2C marketing. I think there needs to be, like, a strong differentiator between, like, B2B SaaS and B2B services, marketing as far as, like, just advice that's out there on the internet.  Because I think there's so many, these people who, like, I was guilty of this in the early days of, you know, doing marketing for the agencies I was in, like being like, well, you know, I got to learn, you know, from as many people as I can.  so many, there's so much content, you know, so much inks built around B2B SaaS marketing, except they just call it B2B marketing.  And so you're like, oh, B2B marketing, that's, that applies to me. know, but in reality, they're selling, you know, tangible products, you know, they  could go in demo for maybe 500 bucks or less or a retainer of 500 bucks or less. And that's a lot easier to sign on to.  And a lot of times it's like you can you can cancel at any time, that sort of thing. Like that model is fundamentally different than, hey, like we're going to, you need to pay eight grand up front and then it's going to be 100 grand for the actual thing that we're building.  Like that's a much more significant investment. And it's going to take more of a more trust built up ahead of time.  I'd say I think a lot of dev agencies tend to have larger price points. And so I think as a result, you got to have a slightly longer perspective.  And but the upsides really good, you know, like if you can get your marketing engine in place, it's like, you know, you pay for a coach for a little while, and you just get one client and it pays for itself, even, you know, after six months or something like that, you get a six big client, and it's like, okay, cool, like, this is working, and, you know, keep it going, and, and the ROI is even more.  So, back to your question, though, like, I guess what's unique about that, I think I think the other thing too, like, this is more of a problem that I think is unique to dev agencies is that kind of like, think, like the legal profession, at least here in the States is there is a deeply entrenched pre supposition that that billing hourly is just doing is way to do it.  And this is interesting, like my clients that I do fractional work for, they've built a product in the legal space, so they're really good at stuff with that market.  And they were talking about how AI is kind of both exciting and also petrifying for a lot of folks in the legal profession because it's like our entire system is built on the billable hour, but if AI can make our work more efficient, then like either jack up our rates significantly and people get sticker shock from that, or it's like, I don't know, it's just affecting their pricing model and it's like making them having to really think about their pricing because it's like when you get greater efficiency, how do you think about the pricing in the legal world?  I think it's the same sort of thing in the dev agency space. There's probably a higher percentage of dev agencies that think that niching down means picking a programming language, not picking a specific industry or picking a specific problem.

39:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I had to write this down. I've been writing down a lot of things, so it's not. But that thing is said about the billable hour.  So my first instinct was like, oh, have you read Productize from Isha Armstrong? Have you? It's a good one.  What is it called? Productize.

39:48 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  You have it there? So yeah, you know what I mean.

39:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I actually have it on my shelf.

39:52 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  I bought it because I need to read it, but I haven't read it yet. I haven't finished the whole thing, but everything that I've

40:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that I found very coherent. And one of the things that they address is that. So when you're used to selling services and you start to move into products, like incentives change, and the whole network of things is not just putting a thing on the shelf.  There's like the way you operate changes. And they talk a little bit about that, what kind of pitfalls. I think if you have the book, it's a good one.  But the way this lit up a light bulb in my head was, so part of the reason why I'm so foolish on workshops is basically they are rails for collaboration, for free form collaboration.  You create the space and you can work together on things on that one. But this is also useful for a deeper integration with your clients.  And again, shoulder to shoulder working with them. The billable hour is going away for some professions. In order to prove impact, you need to be really closer to the metal and say, that change that you guys have, we were a part of it.  Because if you have this model of, we do the work, we send you the work, you don't have a line that connects you to the results of your client.  And then the billable hour goes away. You are supposed to be starting to be based on value or impact, but you are blind to it because you're working from far away and you don't see the impact of the thing, right?  And I was like, oh, okay, this felt something I needed to write down. That's why my eyes went, hmm?  Yeah. Sorry, sorry, I you.

41:47 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Oh, you think you had a third question? What was the third question you had?

41:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, the third question is on your side, what's more challenging for you working with these clients? something that you wish  It was easier. That's more easier.

42:04 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Now, let's see. What's more challenging for me? I think this is not to say there's no challenges. It's more just, know, which are the most apparent challenges.  I think like setting the right expectations and then delivering them, I also think like, I mean, part of it is, as I'm doing work for clients, I'm learning new things and I'm wanting to integrate those learnings into what I do for the next client and the next client.  And so it's, I think, just making sure that I'm being smart about how I take new learnings and actually integrate them into what I do so that I'm not wasting new insights that I'm uncovering You know just kind of like letting them disappear and not improve my service So I think you know, I think a lot of my my Challenges really come down to my own Weaknesses, know like in areas where I'm disorganized that disorganization is gonna affect my business and where I'm more gonna more organized You know that's gonna positively affect things, but I think You know one of things I'm definitely Cognizant of is just trying to keep things organized and orderly so that I can Kind of have a little bit more of a leveraged business you know not just One-and-done sort of thing That

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That speaks to me so much So I'm always I like this stuff But I feel that you also genuinely like what you do so you're reading about it finding things listening to podcasts having ideas, right?  And then I make notes and I love index cards. I love finding index cards and and and one of the things that's really and playing around with I don't know obsidian and notion and Complicated Google Drive setups and and one of the things that I've been noticing is Related to that aspect of like the work teaches you more that you want to apply to the work Right, so it's a cycle and it's also a characteristic of like consulting like consulting is pattern recognition pattern matching So you are learning new patterns and you want to bring them in and one of the things That is it's not a solved thing for me either is  how do I don't miss like ideas? Oh, this was, oh, I like this. I need to write it down, but I need to write it down in a way that I'll find it later, right?  Yeah. And like this AI thing, the note taking, it's cool. I think it's kind of like insurance, but it's not the same thing.  If we say something that is really, oh my God, we can go back, but it's not the same thing as, for a while I was like transcribing all my notes into paper and into obsidian, but that's just too much time, right?  But I understand what you mean, I don't have a solution, but I'm like, I feel that it was funny to mention that because people don't usually, I think share the granularity of this challenge with knowledge management.  It's like, oh yeah, people talk about content, right? Oh, creating content is hard, but it's not content. It's like managing,  or pipeline of of insight or something. don't know that that that speaks to me a lot and maybe it's fair.  I just you know mirror the the question to myself. So for me right now the hardest thing I feel is there's a couple but okay the first one I think is more obvious is that I think I'm a really this is not a sales conversation so it's for me to say this I think I'm a really poor salesman like I don't know how to shift on conversation into the other one.  I'm aware that that's kind of the way of doing things and I've been practicing and getting coaching and writing like checklists and stuff like that so I can see the path forward but that's still like a new thing to me and another thing that sometimes trips me up is I was talking about this with someone else and they said yeah it's because you  of the work and because you love the work you give a lot of it for free. Like you just enter into these conversations and you don't book and the conversations and next thing you know you're like just giving away free consulting and because there's a point I believe for these free-form conversations at which a chapter would make sense like oh we've proved that we can help and at some point we shift it into a different conversation but for me it's I just love the work and I get like I lean in and that's a challenge for me.  I've been trying to police myself a little bit better.

47:36 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah one thing I would I mean you know feel free to take this with a grain of salt but one thing that I've been digging into lately is if another spin selling.  I've heard about it but I never got into it. Yeah I mean I had heard about it too multiple times and I was just like yet another sales month and was like yay.  But I had one client who was not like, they're more an engineer, and they're just like, you know, oh yeah, we use spin selling and it works really well.  And I was like, you know, you're clearly not a salesperson, but spin selling like the approach seems to work for you.  And I was like, okay, I need to look into this. And plus, you know, they're selling something that's not a cheap solution.  So it's like that there must be something to it. And just in my digging through it, it aligns a lot more with the way I would naturally want to have a conversation.  It's much more question driven and learning more about where the client's at. And it's us about making the what they call it like the making the close at the end of call or something.  It's more about just moving things forward. And basically what they, they did like this very scientific approach to like what works, what doesn't work.  And essentially they're like, this method is best if you're like in enterprise sales. Like when you're selling something big and complex and it's going to take multiple calls and it's going to, you know, it's basically more of a relationship driven sale.  And I was like, I can see where this would be really beneficial for agencies to approach it this way, but also for me to approach this because I'm, I'm also like kind of allergic to being disingenuous.  if like I get on a networking call and they're like, so tell me about your problem point or something.  I'm just going be like, nope, nope, nope, but, but it is more of like, think it's S is like situation P is like, I don't know I'm forgetting it, it's like problems, you know, situations like kind of the big picture, like  who you are, what's going on in your business. P is like where you're kind of running into issues. I is implications.  like, okay, how does, how do those problems, you know, translate into, you know, kind of bad consequences. And then in, there's like a same part of in, they kind of cheat, but it sounded better if you just have SPIN.  But it is like needs, needs and outcomes or needs and something else. I mean, chat should be ticked by the answer.

50:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, for sure, yeah.

50:37 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  But yeah, it's basically, you're just kind of like asking questions that help them kind of recognize their own pains, their own implications of that pain and their own sort of needs and whatnot.  And so that way at the end of the call or at the end of multiple calls, say, if you just kind of slow  really working through this, you can be like, so does it make sense to like, you know, have a conversation about what we do, you know, that sort of thing, like you're, you're like asking for permission for a lot of the whole process.  And that goes into like, another book I read that was really interesting, was called, I think it's called start with no.  And I heard about it. Yeah, it was written by, or it was recommended by a guy who's like, you've probably heard of this book, it's similar.

51:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't know. I don't know what's Oh, Chris boss, you mean? Yeah.

51:40 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  So Chris boss recommends start with no in his book. And it basically is like, what it does is it allows the other person to feel in control up front.  Because a lot of what happens is like a cold call or a cold email, you're kind of taking away their power, you're basically saying  And, hey, I'm trying to show that we relate. let's hop on a call. And it's just kind of like, hmm, I don't like, this makes me feel gross, sort of like the way that you're pitching me.  But if it's like, hey, I've helped people reach this outcome. You're even like names, like we've helped someone like you, blah, blah, blah, achieve this outcome.  And I thought you might find it valuable. You know, I'd love to provide some upfront value to you upfront, like, can I give you, you know, kind of three things that you could do to improve your pipeline?  And be like, no problem, if not, just wanted to, you know, make the offer or something along those lines.  And it's like, oh, they're basically giving me an obvious out, you know, the ability to say no. And it's a lot of times people are like.  Well, you know, they said that I could say no, so now I'm going to be like, okay, yeah, you can tell me a little bit more, you know, like they're open to you at least taking the next step.  And I don't know, I thought that was a really interesting approach, isn't it?

53:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can see that. my mind, the picture I've painted is like, and maybe this is a very cold one, but when you walk past the street and you see somebody maybe pen handling, anyone across size is because the moment you walk in, you feel like that person will approach you and maybe you don't want to have that conversation.  So you kind of don't look at them. then I've seen also people that are like for NGOs and stuff like that.  They've been trained on this and they have a much more, it feels like the way you're describing now, they put me at ease in the sense that I don't feel like I need to try to be invisible.  the picture I fainted in my mind.

54:02 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, no, I mean, I think that makes sense. And really it comes down to like giving them the agency and the conversation.

54:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And not like agency, know, more of the personal agency. The power.

54:16 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, give them the power in that conversation. And yeah, I mean, I struggle with the same thing. Like you're in the consulting space and you're like, I don't want to give away too much.  But I'm kind of evolving on that. Like I can provide a lot more value if I'm working with someone.  And sure, if they ask for three different sales calls and they're asking me very specific questions about how to do something, I'm going to be like, hey, we're just kind of getting into the territory of, you know, you're just kind of getting some free consulting from me.  But if it's like, you know, it's true like. They're just trying to kind of get like better understand my framework or better understand why it costs what it costs or that sort of stuff.  It's like, okay, I'll hop on multiple calls to suss out those sorts of things to make sure it's a good fit.  But, yeah, I don't know. And then honestly, you know, I try to give away a lot of free insight by a social, but I think that's, I mean, the downside of social content is it's not personally applied to a specific company.  And so, like, they can try and apply it to themselves, but I think they're going to get more value and impact if I'm helping them ask the right questions and really personalize it in the best way possible to their business.  So it's kind of like, yeah, you might get some benefit from this, but if we were working together, you get even more benefit from it.  Yeah, it's probably a good.

56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  review, I suppose, like if the free conversation is this valuable, imagine the, yeah, so yeah, that's the thing I've, I feel that's a little bit of a stone in my shoe, can I say this, a rock in my shoe, like, yeah, can I say, so, but I think I see the way forward, it's less mysterious, it's just like, okay, there's a skill, there's ways of improving at the skill, following this, I'm getting better every day, but that's something.  And then it's, I mean, actually, I want to be helpful, because you've shared so much, I'm like, is there anything I can help you with in terms of like, the workshops or stuff like that, because you're very generous right now, you gave me a lot of  perspective on your world.

57:01 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  I think honestly, for me, I've never done a workshop, or not strictly speaking. I mean, I guess some of the stuff I do with clients could fall into that category, but like not like a group workshop sort of things.  But I talked to somebody a while back and they're like, have you ever thought about running a workshop? And I'm like, no, but should I?  And they're like, maybe so like based off of what you told me. And they recommended I get this book.  It's very good.

57:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very good.

57:36 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  But I feel like a lot of it in there is all about like physical, like in person workshops. And, and I was like, and maybe I'm wrong, like maybe I just haven't gotten far enough in it.  But I was, I guess one of my questions might be for you is, um, like, how do you think about delivering workshops digitally?  I think the other part is Like right now I do a lot of stuff in Notion, so like I'll kind of have almost like a fill-in-the-blank sort of, mean, kind of like the thing that you had downloaded, like a positioning sort of workbook where I'm kind of just a guide through something like that where they're answering things or we're working on writing down the answers together so that at the end they have this essentially completed template and they have clarity that's personalized to them.  Like when you think of a workshop, can it be something as simple as like something in Notion or when you say workshop, do you mean something like here is a PowerPoint presentation where there's like these, you know, clear breaks where you're doing Q&As and where you're pausing to let people, you know, think through how they're going to answer  or something and then you know there's a little more like back and forth with people who are attending and the person who's teaching that sort of thing.  I guess basically I'm probably asking a bunch of very sort of newbie questions because I haven't attended a lot of workshops and so I don't know what people's expectations are and whether you know if I wanted to just do like hey I could do a work like a free workshop for some people you know as a way to like build my email list and showcase my expertise.  If I should be thinking oh I need to pull together a PowerPoint or if I should be thinking you know what like everyone comes in you're all going to copy this Notion page and we're just going to work our way through it as a group.  I'm going to show you how to answer things and you'll have that sort of resource to take away with you at the end.

59:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure. Do you mind if I share my screen? And I can show you an example. Go for it. So the way I usually do this is the way I'll show you.  But it doesn't have to be like this, OK? I've run workshops on Google Sheets. that's spreadsheets are even possible.  I'll show you what I mean. And there's a way I've been thinking about this, which is in terms of collaboration primitives, right?  So it's better best if I show you. So this is a workshop. It's in Portuguese. It's a recent one.  So that's why I'm showing you this. Have you seen this Miro thing? it Miro? OK. So what I do is, on this case, this was planned for a lot more people.  But it was a free thing. And a lot of them didn't show up, right? But what I planned was I had some slides that were mostly run content.  So I bring Everyone into this thing everyone is in this window and I see their pointers with their names moving around Which is interesting because then people feel that they're doing that together with other people, right?  Mm-hmm, and then I Sprinkle there's a logic to it to do it, but I sprinkle some activities some interactive activities Like there was a voting this was a voting thing where people could drag a vote into things And this was just four different problems around explaining what you do, right?  what's what hurt what hurts the most when you explain what you do and People don't understand what I do.  I take I need a lot of time to explain what I do some people don't understand the connection between How I describe my work and my work and sometimes people think I do X but that's not what I do And so the participants drag these things and put it here, right?  It's just an example. There's many kinds of Activities and as we move through it This is more explosive and then  then there's some exercises, some worksheets, right? And each participant had a row. So this is for one participant, this is for another participant and so on, right?  And actually, like the tool, the tool I'm showing you, it's so much more powerful than this. But what I've noticed is that most people don't spend their days in Miro.  I do, but most people don't, right? So if you like the really advanced functions, most people get a little bit lost.  So I use the basic primitives, which is just like, I give them a space where to put things, it's locked so it doesn't move.  There's a question, there's a post it where people can write down the answer, right? And based on this, and you can see that this is just questions and space for people to put in the answer.  So it's very easy to convert like a notion thing into this, right? The checklist in a sense. So people move through it  I'm asking questions about the problems they solve and then the second thing is the process they use to solve those problems and the third thing is their perspective.  What I'm describing, I've seen things like this around positioning, but I don't think I'm a positioning guy. I just wanted to have like a workshop that people wanted to participate in that I could show them how I do this.  So that's why you see these things. And then people have like a final worksheet where they would just drag the answers here and see the conclusion.  So if you think about it, it's a couple of each worksheet is a funnel where you answer these things to get to these answers.  So there's two funnels, one horizontal one as you move through the worksheets and a vertical one as you move through each worksheet.  And at the end you have a bunch of snippets of what matters about the problems you saw, what matters about the things you deliver, how you deliver your work, how you do your thing, and what's the basis for your approach, what's the perspective behind all that you do.  And then there was a space for people to try to craft a more cohesive sentence, not just a bunch of broken things, right?  So basically there's a link to this, I sent a link to the people, I copy the link, this thing, you can put passwords on it and so on.  And people don't have to pay, other people don't have to pay to use this. And yeah, I mean, this is a basic example where you can see that there's parts of it that are interactive, some parts of it that are just me, you know, talking about stuff, some slides, I put some  and check some checkpoints. Like how are you feeling? Is this being useful? What was the difficult thing about this?  So for instance, this question was, how are we? And just say, please drag two votes to what was the hardest thing to do, right?  There's three options. Know what to do on each exercise. Nobody said this, which for me as a facilitator is a good sign, the sign that I've organized the exercise in a good way.  Coming up with answers was something that was difficult for some people, which is also an interesting data point because how do I solve this?  Do I change the answers? Do I give them some pre-work? I send them a video before the workshop? It's just data that is interesting, right?  finally, picking or filtering my answers. if you ask people, like if I ask a question and I give you four post-its for four possible answers, most people will try to fill in the four post-its.  But if you give them six, they'll try to fill in six. So there's like an element of it which is calibrating what you're asking, the time you have and what resources you put in front of them so they can answer.  And this was just other things and people said, is it difficult to have a unique perspective? And this was a note about Philippe liked the final question.  So was this useful in explaining what I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah.

1:06:30 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  I mean, I think in one of my takeaways is that I probably need to like have some more of these sort of intermediate pieces where I'm kind of explaining the concepts.  Like, you know, the one with like the three shapes on it. Actually, I that shows up multiple places. Yeah, this thing was  index so I would click in.

1:07:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But this is like a status like we've done this thing. We've done this thing. We've done this thing and this is more like a visual framework to explain how everything connects.

1:07:13 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, I guess that's that's part of the thing that I'm trying to work my way through is. You know, I to like have something that has the most value possible.

1:07:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I always.

1:07:26 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  I like my weak point is. Maybe being like not as good of a teacher as I could be. And so I'm always trying to think, how what's a good sort of framework or visual that will help make this more concrete.  And maybe part of that's me, you know, maybe I'm maybe I'm an OK teacher. But I just know that when I've read stuff, you know, and I've seen stuff put out by other people, the stuff that I've most enjoyed consuming.  that sort of stuff in it. It was like, oh yeah, here is kind of how we explain this way of thinking with this sort of visual.  And you're like, oh, that makes so much more sense when you describe it that way. And so I think maybe part of my taste in how I like consuming content has informed what I want my output to look like.  I mean, I really like this, like it's really clean. And I need to probably figure out what the particulars of a workshop for me would look like.  yeah, I mean, when it comes down to just like, you know, maybe the the attendee experience is kind of like the average person, like what their expectations are.  Is it just that like, they don't want to listen for 90 minutes to somebody talking the whole time?

1:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and they want to like kind of get little snippets of here's the thing to think about and ask yourself now we're going to pause while you like do this you know fill in some things and then we're going to talk a little bit more ask you some questions and then fill in this other thing is that kind of like the back and forth that tends to work best or I don't know what are your thoughts around that so yeah at the back and forth it's useful it keeps things interesting for people and also there's there's an idea that I really like and maybe shows up on the book you're reading which is the idea together alone so these exercises about how you explain what you do they were very personal some of the questions here were a little bit more personal and everyone was trying to fill them in at the same time I mean they could just drag up and see everyone's else answers there's ways  around that but I didn't know that that feature but now I know there's a feature for that that increases privacy but I didn't use it then but the point is you are doing your thing but you see the other pointers moving around and that gives a certain sense that yeah I'm doing my thing I'm alone but I'm doing this together with other people which I think is it invites a certain certain sense of aliveness you know and and also the fact that it is interactive it's like this is an infinite whiteboard right it's already different from most software people use so it has a certain sense of I'm in the special place doing a special thing like when I did the workshop on Google Sheets I had to do it there because a company I was I was working for they're like very strict it guardrails so I couldn't use like  anything outside of their approved tools. So that's why I did it. But the primitives, maybe this is useful, the primitives for this kind of collaboration are you need to have a way for people to write down to participate, which is why post-its in the physical world are so popular, because they make it very easy for people to participate.  That's a good primitive. You can simulate that with the Google Slides. It's an online file, just create a square.  And people, you add the shade on it with a shade option in the Google Slides. And people can use it as a post-it, right?  You don't even need this kind of tool. Another primitive is the range. And if you double it, you make it a two by two.  So a way to organize things in space. Like if something is next to this, it means something. If it is next to this, it means something else.  In your framework, it's a two by two. I love two by twos, of course. And it's a An example of that.  The way you position things on that thing changes the meaning of the thing that's written. You don't change what's written, but just by changing the place, that thing means a different thing.  So that's another primitive. And you need timed activities. And this is very easy. Like this software, I'm not trying to show it soft, but this software has a function with a timer.  And you can select a timer. You can put some music on it. makes everything easier, right? Yeah, it's almost even set up for workshops.  It is. It is. I think it's the prime one workshop tool. It's the market leader, I think, by far.  It's a little bit, it can be a little bit overwhelming for people. I've never had much trouble with that because I don't try to use all the features, right?  There is very little features. But it could be overwhelming if you jump into it and you try to get all the.  bells and whistles working. But he's made for workshops. And there's another thing I wanted to say. So that book you're reading, you might have noticed this.  It's a good book. I like the book. love the author. I have a book from that author on my table.  It's a great book as well, this one. I have that one too. I need to finish reading that one.  Oh, as you can see, I mean, I like it so much to the point of maybe the highlights are not useful anymore.  I really like the book and the author. One of the things about that book you're reading is that it's closer to an idea of workshop related to skill development.  So it's mostly about workshops where people learn how to do something, which is a valuable thing to do. But the kind of workshops I'm showing you now, there are less about teaching people how to do something, and they're more about guiding people through a process.  so they can do something during the workshop, okay? So the outcome of a workshop from that yellow book would probably be that person feels more confident in doing this thing, they have had this practice with this, they feel they have leveled up, you know, that they've experimented with the new thing they didn't know how to do.  And the outcome of a workshop like this, I'm showing you, is more around now they have something that they didn't have before, maybe a statement or a canvas or something like that.  The tools, the primitives, are the same, almost all the same. When you're talking about the skill development workshop, the one of the book, maybe you have more things around role play, improvisation, know, prototyping a solution, stuff like that.  But it's a subtle thing, but maybe now that I've told you about it, maybe you'll see it in the book.  But I like the book. It's a good book, and I like the author. Cool.

  Are there any other books you'd recommend on the topic, or is that, I don't know how many books there are on workshop?

1:15:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I don't know if you noticed the post, but I've started to write the book on workshops for consulting companies.  But it's too soon. I'd love to have your feedback on it as soon as they have more stuff to show.  Yeah, sure. But for now, it's too early. But I have a book that I can recommend you. Yeah. How do you do them?  Hmm. There's actually two books I can recommend you. So this one, there's an English version. It's filled with workshop exercises.  And the first bit of it is how workshops work. It's a logic behind workshops. And it's very good. And this guy, where's his name?  Dave Gray. The great guy. I can find him on LinkedIn. And he has written all the books and he also talks a lot about visualizing ideas, so I think you might find that interesting.  There's this other dude, Dan Rome, that he also talks about drawing out ideas for business. And I can put it in the end there.  Dan Rome, I'll write it to you on the LinkedIn message so you don't lose it. Okay, so Game Storming.

1:16:36 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  I have some sort of connection to the Game Storming guy.

1:16:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He lives in so he lives in Portland, right?

1:16:46 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, well I think my old boss used to work there at the company he's at, or maybe he started or something.

1:16:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Explain?

1:16:53 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Yeah, my old boss used to work at Explain. so familiar. yeah, these are cool resources on that.

1:17:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what else? If I think a lot of the advice you'll find online around workshops is written or is presented from the perspective of somebody that is a facilitator.  And they want to level up their skills, become a better facilitator. One of the things that, to be honest, I haven't found much of is that's it's kind of weird because I think it's really valuable and it's very self-serving that I haven't found much of.  But I also feel like it's possible that there's not so other people talking about this. I just haven't found it.  But I've been looking for it, which is its perspective of the workshop as a product. So workshop for a business owner that, you know, they have a business subjective and you want to  workshop to help you with that. If you are a facilitator trying to level up your workshop, there's a lot of books on that.  It's a skill that has been around for a while. There's a lot of information on that. But if you're trying to use workshops as something that fits with your offering matrix, I found less stuff on that.  And I'm trying to collect everything that I can on it. But yeah, I mean...

1:18:30 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Well, actually I gonna have one last question around that. Is this kind of like, where do you think workshops ought to be kind of, I guess, utilized more?  I mean, it seems like maybe if you're trying to appeal to an enterprise clientele that the workshop model might be something where they have to be more receptive to that, because it's like, hey, come in and help get this particular team.  within our larger company kind of, you know, focused on the same thing or adjusted to this new way of thinking or something like that.  And so I could see, like, if your agency, like, has some done-for-you stuff, but maybe also has, like, a component where you're, you know, trying to kind of do some change management things where it could be useful for that.  But yeah, I don't know, that's...

1:19:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To answer your question, yeah, I think the environment changes a lot. So even the arguments you use to sell the workshop change a lot.  And I think oftentimes what you need is not really a workshop, it's a work session that uses workshop principles.  But that's a mouthful. But sometimes people, when you think about workshops, they think, but all this is going to take four hours and there are some workshops like that that they need to be like that, but sometimes you have like this really, well, in the development world, retrospective, sprint retrospective is a little bit like that.  So it's a short session, it's collaborative, people work together to figure out what went well in that sprint on that sprint, and what could improve, right?  This is kind of workshop thinking in a sense, it's collaborative way. And I think depending on who you're selling to, it makes more sense or less sense to go for the bigger things or the smaller things, and also what kind of what stage, for instance, the other day I was talking to someone and she serves, I found the idea really interesting, she serves boring industries.  And she was like, it's from a marketing perspective, which was like I know and you know that you are in a boring business and that's fine but all the marketing agencies want to do the cool stuff and they don't take you seriously but I want to take it seriously because I like to work on boring businesses.  And one of the conversations we're having is about selling marketing to skeptical audiences like I don't know the CFO.  And we were discussing is this a workshop thing for the CFO should we invite the CFO into a workshop because honestly I don't think that's a move.  I don't think we should invite someone that hasn't been convinced yet into a workshop because the workshop is very immersive but if that person is not like open to participate maybe you start something smaller you know maybe a guided meeting that just has one very specific output that doesn't look like the thing I'm showing you now.  I think your question is very good for me to noodle on because I think intuitively I know I'll think about this but I need to find a better a more structured way to think about this but I don't think workshops are like a silver bullet for sure.  I mean I've always been kind of curious.

1:22:15 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  mean I put an offering on my site that's you know a workshop but it's you know I essentially I have a slide deck and there's probably more I could be doing to make it more maybe more similar to this so but yeah I don't know I mean that's just kind of my you know experiment at kind of a smaller introductory offer.  I don't know if that's the best place for a workshop to be you as kind of like a you know a gateway offering you know maybe there's something else that would be a better fit there but  It's You've definitely you know gotten me to think more about the utility of workshops and where they fit and what they Should look like and what you know kind of how to define them and that sort of stuff So it's been super super interesting and that for me as well.  Thank you so much Yeah, well, I hope that we can kind of keep on staying in touch, you know through LinkedIn and maybe hop on another call sometime But I like that.  Yeah, if there's more questions that come up. I'm happy to be an open book and Yeah, maybe we can Just Hopefully I keep on providing good value for you.

1:23:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean I'm very happy we had this conversation. I think you were very generous with what you shared Is it's pleasure?  I think we both have this helper kind of personality We like the thing we do and we see that it's gonna be helpful and I like to help so we  of sharing it. think we both mentioned that it's maybe to a fault sometimes. So I'm very open to that.  And would it be okay for you if I send you like one or two links for newsletters that I've written about topics we've mentioned here?  then it's my thinking on that. And there's two that I think maybe you would find informative. But I don't want to give you a homework.  It's just like maybe you'll find it interesting.

1:24:29 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  No, I mean, I'm always game for more sort of insightful stuff to help me learn things better. yeah, if you have something for me to read, I'm game for it.  Cool, cool. And the same for you.

1:24:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  there's like something that you feel like, of all the things that you share that this thing, you feel like it would connect better to me like something that, oh, you really should not trust the algorithm.  show you these. should go after it.

1:25:03 - David Hoos (Haus Advisors)
  Okay, yeah, let me think on that. But I'm more than happy to. Thank you. Thanks so much. You gave me a lot of extra time, so I appreciate that.

1:25:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
