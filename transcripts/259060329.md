  Okay, so this is me testing the enthusiasm of the podcast. Welcome Alex to this session. I'm very excited to have you on.  What time is it there? Yes, this is the classic, right? When you live in Australia, everybody asks you what time it is there.  So one of the things that we let's let's start off with the banger. You think that everyone is wrong, right?  Is that as it? Yes. Okay, uh-huh. So one of the things that I find really interesting in what you do is clearly you have deep perspective on this.  And you've been thinking about this for a while. Well, I remember when you created that carousel, I just sent you a message, right?  I just sent you a message. I didn't know you were about to break the internet back then, but I sent you a message and you were like, yeah, I've been working on this for a long time.  And one of the things that you do is that you're not always posting content, which is interesting because it seems that you have a certain knack for, well, you're  work with words, You have a certain knack for, you know, creating things that really tap into the collective unconscious, like people don't know that they think this, but then they realize, oh my God, yes, that's, that's exactly what I've been thinking for a long time.  And you just put it in words. Well, that's a fascinating thing. That's a really, that's a really impressive skill.  But one of the things that I'm intrigued about is, and I think a lot of people in the audience could be as well, is what kind of signals do you pay attention to?  know, because one of the main things that you mentioned is the importance of perspective, right? And a way to build perspective.  Tell me more about how you build perspective. I think I should just shut up and let you spread your magic.  So Alex James on LinkedIn, I've heard you have quite the TikTok following Alex James as well. Okay. Very good.  So thank you for participating in this and let's start. Okay.
