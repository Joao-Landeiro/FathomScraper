0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  end of the financial year for you guys or what is it like a sorry so end of the year what do you mean by end of the year like is it yeah we are in October we have only two months ahead yeah you're kind of planning for the last parts of it yes yeah I know it's just like it's crazy this this time because you know everything's going so fast but it is what it is yeah it is going by really fast I agree with that I'm just trying to find yeah it's gone by really you know really quick since we've lost you know spoken you know to you and like and it's only like it's only been like a month but it's it's crazy you know like how when you know how far we've been going and how fast we've been going so it's like been interesting times so it's been good though like so it's we're trying to like speed up a little bit  But can you hear me?

1:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I'm just trying to find phone and camera. But I can't hear it.

1:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK, great.

1:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, shall we?

1:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Joining us, he has no taker right here, but I don't know if he's here.

1:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, just show up. There he is.

1:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, there he is. I think, yeah. Hello. Hello.

1:27 - Joao Landeiro
  Can you hear me?

1:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I can hear you. I can You can me well. yeah, it's great to be connected, because I was just, we've had a big push.  I guess it's only been October now. So October 16th, we had a big push like a month and a half ago with the eggs team, as we discussed.

1:51 - Joao Landeiro
  And it's been really good also.

1:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I realize like having them face to face was very helpful, like in the same room that we can discuss some of these things, especially in the beginning, like just trying to find.  and out everything. I can imagine that that part was good and we've had a good relationship and we pushed through a lot of what the product, at least the first parts of the product are, but our engagement will end just by how we budgeted it and how we would do it would end at that.  Obviously the bulk of the work is done this month and then there was like a few hours in November kind of for handover or for the next step.  think when we first planned it out we were thinking like we can get a lot of it done within this period and then as we've done it we realized actually there's a lot that still needs to happen so we're probably still going to need some support moving forward.  So that's why I wanted to reach out to you guys also and do work together in the past of that, whether not it could be interesting and how it would look like.  And I think one of the first things I can do is kind of show you what they created and like the first part of the vision so you can see it and more of it is still being created I would say but it can give you a viewpoint so you can like kind of  Ask questions after you see it, um, right? Do, uh, and let me know if you have any questions or anything too.

3:08 - Joao Landeiro
  So do you see my screen?

3:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, uh, is just going to, I'm going to try to zoom in. How do I zoom in here? No, that's the other way.  Okay, this is the most I can zoom in. So now this is the view of a compliance officer that they made.  So this is the video and I'll pause it along the way.

3:28 - Joao Landeiro
  Hopefully if I can figure that out.

3:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So this is, um, this is the dashboard where people come in. So you have like the overall dashboard. Then you have some tasks requiring action that we actually auto generate for them.  And then there's incoming request that, uh, they go in with. Um, and I'll, and I'll kind of walk you through a flow.  This is working. So they, they kind of walk you through and then the G side we're building the whole B side that the whole E and S still need to be built.  Then we have this compliance map, which is actually all of the content that we're building, the risk assessment, the policies, the training, the communications, the controls, the suppliers.  So each of these have to be developed out more. We're developing, I would say, the top three risk assessment policies, trainings, communications, controls.  So an example of this is that we would automatically generate a task that you need to do around governance.  So it's like deploy annual conflict of interest form. So we would set it up for you. They would click on it, and then it would say, or finish policy set up, we have both flows.  One is if you want to set up a policy, these are the different kind of policies that you would need to have in the governance side.  And then they would click on a policy, let's see, and I kind of show you like the different steps within the policy that you need to do.

4:54 - Joao Landeiro
  It still needs to be developed a little bit more.

4:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  the overall flow is like... Here's an anti-bribery encryption policy and then we'd actually give you the template for the policy and say, you know, you're not started and then we have the option for you to edit the policy or download it or share it to somebody to review.  And then, you know, they can edit it within the document or use some kind of AI generate tool to help use it and then you can also report we revert to the default policy if they mess up and then once then you can share it for review.  can send it internally to people to review and then you can comment or edit it and then you send it for review and then they're able to make comments on it.

5:43 - Joao Landeiro
  Right.

6:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like for them to draw. So then you approve the deployment and then it's sent to the whole company, you can deploy and decide who you want to send it to.  And then you can see it in the employee portal, you know, when it's been done and then you can go to the next part.  So that's just one workflow and then you can track the completion on who's actually done it and follow up.  So that's like for the policy overview, but we have one other flow too that it could show you here.  Yeah, so this is just saying that you can't edit it once it's been deployed because there's some fail state mechanism and it's not as important here.  But let's see if I can zoom forward to some of these too. So you're able to track, so you're able to deploy it and then for people to review and then it kind of gets updated that it's been deployed here as we get a kind of updated one.  But I think what's more interesting is the next flow, which I'll show you.

7:20 - Joao Landeiro
  This video is not the best edited, let's see.

7:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you could send a reminder to people to complete the video. I think it's more interesting about like, okay, you finish this flow, it's not as important.  But I think there's one flow now which is about like finish the policy, finish the code of conduct, the conflict of interest.  So we also again give them, we also give them, you know, the conflict of interest form. They click on it.  We actually provide the conflict of interest form that they need to and they deploy it. And then they go in and kind of confirm that it's okay to deploy.  And then you deploy it, you know, send it for review or you're deployed into the employee portal. It goes into the employee portal.  Employees have been notified. You know, we switch to the user employee user and then they get an email saying like, hey, need to complete this task.  You know, please complete this task. They go in and then they get the form that they need to do.  This is like an annual check that most employees should do.

8:34 - Joao Landeiro
  Make it easy on their mobile phone. They'll try doing it on their phone and then you submit it and then it's completed.

8:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then you go back to an employee center, which is like an employee view where they would have a lot of tasks like, you know, complete the training, sign off on the policy that was sent.  Here's some ongoing things that you need to submit as part of the governance side. And then as a compliance view, you get to  see whether not, you know, they've completed the form, you know, and then you chase them up. So a lot of this stuff is doing, like, very manual right now.  It's like, I have a thing on MS forms. I send it out to a lot of people on email.  I come back, try to track it, and you don't have dashboards and different things. Whereas we kind of put everything into a task, like every part, it requires a different task associated with it, and then we tell them how to do it.  So that's kind of the flow, and it really goes back from the if I go back to the beginning.  Let's see. Sorry. Where is it? Let me see. Where did the video go? Here it is. So then going back to where's this.  So if you go back to. This part. Like we're building policy training, communication controls and risk assessment. Probably by the end of November, but there's a whole another part around kind of reporting like the other boxes at the bottom of these, these like, you know, six boxes that we haven't done yet.  And then we also need to bring it together and then we haven't done it in the S and the E part yet.  But that's kind of where we are. I hope that makes that makes sense. What is made. I think so.

11:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's a great development in a very short of time. And to be honest, from what we've seen in the past, we saw in the past, I think it's, you managed to get together and having a clear path and how to make things to happen the flow.  And it seems very logical for me right now. As I see quickly, but of course. we have to get more in depth about to understand how to navigate to all that.

12:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you know, congratulations.

12:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a big amount of working in a very short of time. Thank you.

12:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Luckily, we did actually have, and we still have a lot of the information, like, like, know, conflict adventures form.  We already had a lot of the data like already put in into like an ugly design, you know, and we also had, like, same with the risk assessment and that we had it.  So they're able to take out some of our existing ones and then make it pretty, and then make the overall flow make sense, which really was, I think, that's cracked the picture of, like, that compliance map.  Like, we didn't know how to visualize that compliance map, and they were able to crack that and the dashboard.  And our pilots that we've been showing, our pilots, they've been very happy with that compliance map because it puts everything at compliance offices, their head, into a very map, very clear, you know, what needs to be done.  So, but it's more developing those that we will need help with. And I think, you know, one of the things  that I also realize it's like, it's been really nice to have both, so we're working with like Rui, I don't know if you worked with Rui before, Rui at eggs, and then Pinar is a UX UI designer, but I'm realizing that we need, it's not just that UX UI designer, I think we need somebody like Xiao or somebody like that can think about the process and the like the overarching like strategy, and then have the UX UI designer do it because it's been, it's been, I feel like the UX UI designer wouldn't have been able to do Rui kind of being like, okay, this is like, we understand the overall picture of the strategy and then you kind of executing on it, so I think that's like, that we would need some kind of like senior person kind of understanding that and then kind of guiding the UX UI design, I think that's from what we've seen there, but we wouldn't need to kind of continue on this, we have a big push towards the end of the year, both in terms of like development side, we're starting to develop, like so we have the compliance map already, I wonder if I can show you that.  actual app, where we are on this, because we have, yeah, so this is our actual, our actual app. So you can see our, we already have, you know, the front end on the app, a little bit ready and then, you know, then the compliance map from what you saw here.  But the content is not, is not in here. But we have, you know, some of the, the things are ready, kind of, you know, like working, I would say, in, in the, in the compliance map and the overview.  But this is only the front end part. So, but this is the actual app. So we have been moving forward on that, but there's still a lot that we need to develop, you know, just to continue on the process.  Yeah.

14:55 - Joao Landeiro
  Right.

14:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, um, from what you said, and it completely, agree about, you know, many times when you have you, add to your designers, have more focus on the functionality and I think we are managing to have strategies in the process because, you know, in the end of the day, it has to be a nice experience for the users.  We are talking about something that since we're the beginning from the first meeting you said, we don't want to make this whole process very bureaucratic.  We want to make it easy for people. having in mind that, you know, it should be a very easy experience, a good experience so people can feel engaged with, you know, ESG in a whole in a sense or working in a company like that who has a very interesting approach in ESG.  think this is how we can help you in terms of seeing the overall future, but also having the service and experience on the top of everything.  Of course, you have to go to all the deployments and all the documents you have to do your own part, but it has to be fluid, it has to be nice to do it.  Otherwise people won't do it. Yeah, exactly.

16:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Exactly.

16:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's how to simplify it.

16:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Somebody to also challenge us not just to do it, but how do we make sure we simplify it? How do we make sure that we make it easy for the people and viewers to respond to it?

16:40 - Joao Landeiro
  So, no, I agree with that.

16:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I feel like we have an idea now because we're working with them.

16:46 - Joao Landeiro
  We have the overall map.

16:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's actually looking like And then you know, the faster that we can do with the faster that we can develop it because we have really fast front.  and developer too. So it's more like, um, yeah, trying to better understand what it takes. So we have, we have pretty much until the end of this month because two more, two more weeks, I was looking, I think I was looking at the, I thought we had more time and then I was speaking with Rui and I was like, oh .  And that's why I wrote that to you Mel because I like, okay, I don't actually have the time that I thought we don't have you as long as we thought we did.

17:22 - Joao Landeiro
  So that's why I reached out quicker.

17:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And so it's like by the end of October, like most of their hours will be up. And then in November, it's like almost eight hours a week.  that's more like closing up, you know, things and fixing the components and doing that, maybe doing a handover. So ideally we want somebody to start in November timeframe and then like December and January to be able to help close out and also maybe have a handover with them and so that they could finish on some parts and then you can take it over.  And that, um, so that's what we're looking for, uh, you know, availability. I don't know if we need somebody full time or maybe it's better to have someone full time because we've been using that.  full time like in the last two months to have a really big push, but I think it also depends on your availability too.  So that's why I just want to reach out and show you this and have the initial conversation. So then you can think about how it could look with your resourcing and that.

18:15 - Joao Landeiro
  Yeah. Okay.

18:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In terms of, you know, the continuity of the project, I think it's okay in terms of, you know, thinking in that life.  So are you still thinking about launching something in January or February? Have has the timeline changed or are you still with those go?

18:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. I think we, let's just say, like I've changed the deadline for the investors from like December to Q1, you know, of left a little bit blank, but I do think that we need to launch something by the end of the year.  Whether not the enough is the policies, procedures, training, and third party that we've already done with eggs, maybe if we can just launch that part.

19:08 - Joao Landeiro
  So then part of our product, like in part of our pilots are using that part up and then the rest of them we can like launch later on.

19:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think that will be okay, but I think it'd be, but I'm not sure that we can wait until like, until March to launch everything because we need to also be able to convert some of the pilots to start working.  But from my understanding, some of them are already happy with just like policies, procedures, training, and that part, and they're happy to start using that functionality in terms of not having to chase them to deploy policies into the organization.  So like that flow that we showed you, we showed them to some pilots and they're like, oh, this is really great, we can start using this.  So maybe that would be what we would deploy by the end of the year while we start building out the rest of Because that also, you know, we need the picture about what we're building so that the front end developer and the.  back-end developer can start working, right? So like the more, and we're also hiring more front-end and back-end developers to go faster on the, you know, the first part of them.  Eventually, they're going to catch up, right? So the faster that we can go with this, then the faster that they can go to.  But I'm quite flexible. Like we're trying to look at different options right now, you know, like there is a person that our development team that's based in Norway that is looking at a UXUI designer, but I'm not sure that, again, it goes back to like, I'm not sure one person is the right person for the job.  I think we need like, you need more than one person, like maybe more senior person and a junior person.  So I feel like a team might be better. And then there's also the cost factor, of course, that we need to consider and everything.  So, yeah, so that's what we're trying to figure out the best way forward.

20:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right, and I don't think you just mentioned about, you know, the structures you are thinking, but based on our previous proposal, do you think we can continue?  you know, strategy about having a couple of six months working together in a couple of hours or setting up a couple of hours because we had some people who were working, know, like Jerome in the first three months and then Joe would be in the next six months, for example, because I believe that now if you do something for the next six months or give you traction for everything you want to do.  First beginning, so not to start something and then step back, start something and step back. So that would be a way of working.  I don't know if, you know, that the previous proposal makes sense for you right now or you just or you want to think about something else because it seems like they still have a lot of work to do.

21:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think I feel like I'm not sure I'm quite open. I think that like when we had the first  process like a very big push over a certain time period, right? And now we've had that big push with eggs.  So what is it going to take to kind of maintain the momentum that they've created? And then is that like, is that, and then I don't know if it's like, because I do think like, we need somebody that can execute very quickly along with like kind of the strategy.  So how we've been doing it is like, we have a maybe three hours sprint like in the beginning of two weeks, we're going to go through each of the process and say, okay, how do we do this?

22:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How do we do this?

22:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Draw it out, do that. And then we have touch points like, you know, every other day or every week to see like the progress of the UX UI designer, right, in between.

22:38 - Joao Landeiro
  So it's like a big book for the strategy in the beginning.

22:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then maybe following up with the UX UI designer to make sure that they're on track. then we have another, you know, follow up meeting there.  And then at the end of the two weeks, we presented to a pilot customer and say, hey, what do you think about this?  So it's been kind of like very intense, you know, in that period, maybe more intense for like, it's been more hours on the UX UI designer.  But I wouldn't want to like, but I think the, what I've seen is the hours that the more senior person that can put in the beginning really helps the UX UI designer come out with the right thing.  If you didn't have that person in the beginning, the UX UI designer might have gone into another path that like didn't make it.  it's like, I think that's something that I think what we've learned from So strategy discussions, so they're very clear on what we built so that they can communicate it with the UX UI designer and then we come in.  So I don't know if that's how the proposal, I have to look back at your proposal aside, now I'm going learn kind of a methodology that seems to be working at least with the eggs team.  So I don't know if you could update our presentation based on that. And then again, I think it depends on the availability.  Do we need, like, yeah, do we, like the other parts that we have that are coming, are not going to be as.  intense as the ones that we're doing right now, the big push around policy procedures, training risk assessment, and third party.  Those are very heavy. I don't know how much we're gonna be able to get within two weeks, so there might be a part where we need to be like, we might need a handover or not, but those are the heavy parts of the ones.  The rest of them like reporting and describing reports from and then like an audit trail on that, it's not gonna be as deep.  But I don't mind saying like, okay, first three months, we go all in and go full-time. And then like the last three months, we do part-time or something like that when we see what we have.  But I think a little bit is like, we don't know what we don't know. We thought like when we did the first design with eggs and I kind of set this budget, we're like, we're gonna be done by then.  And then we realize, okay, no, we're gonna need more budget for it, but then we need to see how much more budget can we afford, given that we put all the money in here.  And then how do we balance that moving forward? Cause there was always gonna be design help that we need.  Yeah. Well.

25:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So do you have any questions?

25:03 - Joao Landeiro
  I do.

25:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Can I fire away?

25:08 - Joao Landeiro
  So thank you for the context.

25:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It was really pretty as well. Nice to look at.

25:16 - Joao Landeiro
  And I'm assuming that now you have a lot of visual components that you can use, right? have this, like, don't know, bar.

25:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We don't need to code actually again. Yes.

25:28 - Joao Landeiro
  That is great. So probably the development time of the next stages will not be shorter than the one so far.  Yeah.

25:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I agree.

25:44 - Joao Landeiro
  And I'm a little bit, it's not entirely clear to me what questions do you have right now? Not about this conversation.  It's the whole project that you need answers for.
  ACTION ITEM: Set up convo w/ Eggs team + João/Joao for project handover. Coordinate in Nov when Eggs still has hours left - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/sHLyp67zpLnxkhkv_yZXEL42jczvExvy?timestamp=1556.9999

26:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Um, I think it's like, for me, I'd like to understand how you would like to work on this, given like what you see.  I'm also, I'm wondering at one point that maybe you could have, we could set up a conversation with you and eggs and I just want to see, because I don't, from my understanding, eggs has already booked themselves onto other projects.  they're not like saying that they, they're not fighting for this project right now, you know, that's, at least that's my initial impression.  I haven't asked them to bid on it, but I know that PNR is already going to be good to have a conversation with, you could have, I'm like, quite open and transparent as always, like, have a conversation with really, I can say like, can you talk to them, see, and then you can learn like what they see, what they think in terms that is needed for this to make it work.

26:43 - Joao Landeiro
  I'm open for that.

26:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  For me, it's like, I know that we're not going to get through everything. So like, you know, if you look at the compliance map, we're not going to get through it.  And it's still going to be like, there's a lot of missing pieces, like, I think, you know, as they go through and as they develop, something's going to pop up and then you're going to be like, okay, how do we do this?  And we're going to need it. I think that there's some of the processes we haven't totally thought out, and that's when it's very helpful with these strategy sessions, when it's like, you know, who's the user, let's walk through a user flow, like from this person, what is he looking at, and he kind of forces us to go through and be like, have you thought of this?  Have you thought of this? Have you thought of this? you thought of this? And then once we have that, then it's easier for the UXUI designer to design it, right?  But without those initial things, we would have been like, here, just do this, right? And then, but then because he asked these poking questions that we have, and then we kind of find out, okay, we need to look at it from this point of view, oh, we hadn't thought through this logic, oh, we need to consider this.  That's been very helpful in getting the process a lot clearer for the UXUI designer to work. So that's why I think it's important to have that.  Like, so we've been working off of Miro, you know, Jia, last time you had used Miro to the same thing when we're from Miro, he has some user stories, like user journeys, and then we try to follow through on each of the sides, and we go through each of the process.  And we're going to have. Was it me?

28:02 - Joao Landeiro
  Sorry.

28:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, we have a mirror from eggs, too, but that's been good with our developer who's also based in Croatia, too.  He's been participating using mirror and giving feedback and looking at the overall flow. So that's been a good way to manage it.  Any other questions?

28:26 - Joao Landeiro
  Yeah, so the designers, they are from eggs, but the developers are not from eggs, correct?

28:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, the developers are our developers. have our front-end developers and we have some back-end developers. So when I showed you the app, that was our own developers taking eggs, designs, and putting that in.

28:48 - Joao Landeiro
  Okay, so even if eggs cannot design the whole thing, maybe the developers with the stuff they already have can get to a workable version.  And even if it isn't like the same thing as eggs, but they have the legal parts now, right? can just...

29:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, they have, like at least they have enough to do policies, procedures, training now on those, because eggs has kind of developed the one.  They're probably two or three weeks behind what eggs has done. But once they're done with that, know, how far eggs is gonna get a risk assessment and third party management, which is what they're doing now over the two weeks, then they do that.  And then if we don't have another designer coming in, it's gonna get ugly, right? Because then we have, they'll have caught up with the development and then we don't have as much, and then they're gonna...  And then we had, before we had eggs designed, we were using our front end developer as a UX UI designer, which wasn't the best situation, right?  So it's just like, we're trying to get ahead and have all of the designs and everything ready so that when the development team comes, like they're probably like, yeah, two or three weeks behind the team that they can start implementing things so that we can build quicker.

29:58 - Joao Landeiro
  So there's a few... I'm sorry. Perving, you know, I do have another meeting, but I have like three minutes, but I can, but I can set up another meeting too.

30:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I get like that meeting something half an hour.

30:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I could also meet in half an hour after that meeting.

30:13 - Joao Landeiro
  So, yeah, so let me make the money to the F stuff to step because maybe I'll just leave this for another conversation.

30:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, no, no, I actually, I think, as Abi has another meeting, I think maybe we can just write down some questions for you.  I'm going to send you, you know, tomorrow. And then we set up to talk on Monday, for example, as you suggested before.  So we're more structured to talk about. Well, it is now a question for us to understand where you are.
  ACTION ITEM: Write down questions re: project status, needs, workflow. Send to Abbey tomorrow for discussion in next call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/sHLyp67zpLnxkhkv_yZXEL42jczvExvy?timestamp=1849.9999  And again, can we just jump in the project as we're just keeping. the same momentum and you know the same energy that's what I was talking about maybe just like we can write down some questions right now if you have to leave.
  ACTION ITEM: Send links to João/Joao for review of current project status (incl. app demo, compliance map, workflow videos) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/sHLyp67zpLnxkhkv_yZXEL42jczvExvy?timestamp=1860.9999

31:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah that would be great or I might I'll probably be free in half an hour or two but yeah we can do that I think I just have an initial conversation so you can get it I can send you the links that I sent at least so you can look at it again now and you can forward it to shout but yeah let's have another call on Monday or even yeah like our or Tuesday or we could try to just connect over the phone and I think there will be a handover period but that's why I was thinking like while in in October we're going into no we're in October now in November when eggs still has a few hours left it could be a good time for a handover too because they're still part of the project so then it gives you time to like kind of onward while they're still in it so that was just the thinking but yeah let's let's um let's have a let's just stay in touch on the chat and then we'll find another time to catch up but
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule follow-up call w/ João/Joao for Mon/Tue. Coordinate via chat for specific time - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/sHLyp67zpLnxkhkv_yZXEL42jczvExvy?timestamp=1860.9999  It's good that you guys can like at least have your brain thinking now that you've seen Where we are right now, so great.  Thank you so much.

32:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
