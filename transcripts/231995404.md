0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello. Yes, can you hear me?

0:03 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I can. Can you hear me? Yes, I can.

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Give me a reason, three minutes. Okay. You I have to finish doing my breath work.

4:34 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  No problem, no problem.

4:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you been doing that for a while?

4:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Since December 25th. What do you think?

4:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's been a while.

4:44 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  We've both every day, between three to five times a day. Okay.

4:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, if this is not my chart, yeah.

4:54 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, I'm sure it shows like, like a GitHub.

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  thing with all the days filled in. You're invisible now because of the crowd.

5:07 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Funny how it's not working. You kind of see some dodgy, strange-looking lines. Yeah, yeah. Funny. Yeah, so this is like a graph.  But then I've had three viral infections since December. So I'm just recovering from a new one. I'm still a bit infected.  So it's been very inconsistent, very erratic. But it's interesting to see how when I get a viral infection, then my breastwork, you can see the immediate result.  Also, my resting heart rate and my heart rate variability.

5:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's, yeah, I've never committed. something like that for a long time, but desperate.

6:05 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  believe it works. Desperate because of the asthma and sinus issues I've been having since Covid. I told you I was in bed from November till August last year.

6:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  November to August?

6:24 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Not August to November? No, November 23 to August 24. I was mostly in bed because of my sinus inflammation.  That's my allergy. I was in June, then took medication, got better in August. It's three years of immunotherapy. Then I got hit by a cold mid-November, and since mid-November to now, which is mid-February, I've had three viral infections.  I've only been okay for maybe six or seven days in the last three months. Is that three months already?  three months, two months, mid-November to mid-December, mid-December to mid-Jan, mid-Jan to mid-Feb, three months.

7:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Jesus, that's heavy. Marafa is also, since Covid she got like some sinus, some perma sinus thing and yeah, it takes a toll for sure.  I'm also not feeling, I mean, not feeling amazing because here right now it's really hot. We are going through a heat wave and it's a little bit, it's weird because the heat here also mixes with the humidity, but at the same time it just gets these shifts in humidity, like it gets really humid and then really dry, like really close to it.  So it wrecks havoc on your respiratory system. But I've been sniffing a lot of glue, helps, I don't know why, and anyway, sorry.

8:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

8:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just had a piece of glue here next to me and I thought I could make a good joke, maybe not a good joke, just a joke.  You know, you be going through a hard time trying to pour the real drugs.

8:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's like, okay, wow, that's like, it's tough man. It's like, we want everyone else.

8:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not even like the right kind of glue, right? I didn't realize the type of glue. I think it's that one that cobblers use for the shoes.  I think they call it the contact one. Anyway, I think there's this new thing about you.

8:42 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I never sniffed But actually look at it. This is amazing. I didn't know about this. I never heard about this until I moved to Brazil.  But like, if you're really at the bottom of the hole, some guys, they make like, you know, tape recorders.  Yeah. So they make a tee out of the strips, the ribbons inside of the tape of the cassettes. Because that thing has a lot of lead.  That's insane. I mean, apparently it gets really crazy, but you'll die like in months, I suppose, I don't know.  But so it's a kind of knowledge that I've never come across in the default worlds, like, what can you make a tee out of that?  I didn't know. Anyway, the conversation took a little bit of a grim turn, sorry. Anyway, let's improve this. I've been reviewing our conversation.  And like last time we ended up shifting into a different direction, which was the direction of testing out like with your audience, what things they might be interested in getting  workshop about. But then you got ill and I don't know if you had time to learn some things on that, so we can figure out what's the best way to do it.  Let me send you the mirror link, by the way, it's here on the chat. Okay.

10:17 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And it has been at the back of my mind, but it's not been front of center. I've been finishing up my intro series with him.

10:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've got all the drops.

10:27 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So it's intro email, top three mistakes. And then invite to my diagnosis, and then a summary email. So all of those are written.  And that's to be my lead magnet, that's an alternative to, and up to my newsletter, call to action. Got it.  So it's my first material lead magnet, that's an alternative. the diagnosis is part of it. I guess the diagnosis tool could be a lead magnet on the top, but I guess it's question of where would that live?  unless compelling as an intro series for my purposes, is to build a relationship with a reader over time so they perceive me as a thought-eater and an expert Thinking thinking thinking I do think There needs to be a simplification of the challenge in order to fit it into an hour Mm-hmm agree And I think there does need to be a component There is a group workshop to treat it like a group workshop So I can't give people one-on-one support Maybe there is a component of participant collaboration  But I guess it depends who the persona, the target persona is, like, what's their personality type, what's their, what are they trying to get out of it and how are they thinking about it and who are they, people have a greater propensity for collaboration and others have less of a co-op propensity for collaboration.

12:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And even the ones that have propensity, sometimes they're not very good at it, they're just like people but they're not very structured.  I agree. I Given that this probably will be a group thing where people are not part of it. What's again?  again? What's the password?

12:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  To look into the mirror? is it not on the, yeah, it's RnRn, your name twice.

12:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Low caps.

12:49 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah. Here, yeah.

12:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me bring it to you. Yeah, thank you. So, so given that the people will probably not be from the same organization, I don't think you need to.  was too much on collaboration. I think the format I think for this would be together alone. Like they are on the Miro board, but their performance is not dependent on somebody else's being, you know, paying attention and being committed to it.  Like you can just do your thing and there's other people. And the group aspect can be helpful in the sense you pick up examples, like from one person.  I said, oh, I saw what Jamie said here. is really clever, by the way, is what Jamie's insight about his own thing.  And somebody else, maybe, I know, Peter hears that and says, oh, yeah, it's true, I have the same thing, you know.  But you don't need to get Peter and Jamie working together because that introduces a certain brittleness to the workshop, especially if they're not part of the same organization.  And my team would be like competitors because they have the same sort of business, perhaps. So, that's a thing.  do you want a minute to go through the, I see you're moving around the mirror board? No, I'm listening.

14:12 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm just absorbing. Yeah.

14:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's in two weeks flew by, so two or three minutes. So the basic thing is at the end of the last conversation, we were thinking about, okay, let's test this, right, talking about you putting together a workshop and asking people what they would like to see in it.  And there were two basic directions on that. One of them was because on engagement. So you perhaps ask about an AI workshop.  And the other one was focusing on not engagement, but more on nudging them towards choosing something. I think that is already pretty much within your zone of excellence.  So in the second scenario, we would assume that maybe these will get less speech than a post about the magic of AI, but at least the answers will not pose outside of our zone of excellence.  So that was one thing. And the other thing, which was actually the initial plan, was for this session, we would start to put together the exercise and the sequence for the ICP workshop.  What's my thinking on this? I think the idea of figuring out what people want to learn from you in a workshop is more valuable than us just designing a workshop on ICP.  And now my current thinking is, you don't stand still, so you keep you know helping things, working with people, and I'm thinking like, do we need to change something in our plan to fit with the things you're developing and learning through your working with Liam?  Is it, does this change anything like the things you've done with Liam? Does that change anything about our workshop, where it goes in your process?

16:34 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It just sounds my way.

16:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. What is your area? I don't know.

17:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  you I mean, it's really geared towards CEOs, what do we get to when we talk about the mirror? Do we talk about the who?

17:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, we spoke mostly about your process, then towards the end we were like, maybe the ICP is like the biggest lever, and then we collected some information around ICP, the theories of ICP, and you got some references.  But then, because towards the end, were like, maybe we should just figure out what people want. we left on a bit of a different note.  So I think there's like three main directions.

18:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I mean, this is kind of very nuanced and quite niche.

18:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's about ICP definition. Because the thing you're doing with Liam, I assume there's kind of a journey aspect to it, right?  A user journey aspect to it.

19:01 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm thinking about a client. This is like a summary call that we had. So it's like refocusing that business.  I mean in my head what's kind of the ideal would almost be I think, I think, taking people through some sort of canvass is probably going to be the most fruitful, but I'm wondering if it's like...  I don't know if it's viable to like a workshop around the introduction of a strategic framework. It's like, here's how I build a marketing plan of strategic framework.  And then I give you access in motion to play and take you through it. And then people can ask me questions about it.  I don't know, it's like you can't fill this in in an hour, it's maybe too ambitious to do, well for small business but not like a material business, it's just a size, signal earlier stage businesses, they wouldn't need something too complicated anyway, but then I'm not sure, they're short on canvases either.

21:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah and also I think one of the, so I was talking to a guy that was there when the proposition covers was made, these guys really close with a guy from the business model and so on and it's really just because it's an ecosystem right and like they start with the business model but then  have other canvases that help you figure out like what goes inside of each box of the business molecule. And the main thing about this was it's not just converting into a canvas.  Because the canvas is just a vehicle for your expertise, right? It needs to get famous.

22:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You need to get the canvas famous.

22:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the things you do for the canvas to be famous, mean, you know about marketing, they mean like it's kind of red building in a sense, right?  So it's definitely something that could be done. But I suspect that the best way to go about this right now would be trying to integrate what you're doing with Liam.  I love this stuff. read all these case studies. I'm sure these things, we share some API, some reference to our API that we can connect what you're doing with him and this thing, right?

23:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  correct me if I'm wrong my interpretation I don't know how because I mean what we do I mean if look at the offer when we were talking about it we're like what's the offer I kind of like so essentially we did the diagnostic and then reshaped all the emails so all the emails you can see the notion right so we had the yeah I can see the notion yeah we had the kind of problem solution problem solution problem solution and then I remember one point with Liam was at what's the most valuable thing how to evaluate the direction and he's like it needs to be belief changing mm-hmm your belief like okay and then I was like I think we should point  diagnostic tool, which is like, And then it's like, okay, so you did a diagnostic and then there's to be an offer, the offer has to be commercial.  Okay, what's the offer? And essentially, what we ended up with is, you know, if you read here, it's like, okay, this is a summary of the series.  So you can see it's got a summary of three common mistakes. And a bit of a narrative, outdated playbook.  And then if you're tired of studying growth ready to become category leader, let's create your breakthrough strategy plan, review your diagnostic results, create prioritized roadmap, focused on your three biggest opportunities.  So in theory, I wonder if we did a workshop that was related to the diagnostic output. The, in theory, great idea.  is what happens when you have different people scoring different scores in different areas of the diagnosis. But in theory, if the workshop was related to the result of the output from your diagnosis, it would be more relevant to you.  How do we do that with knowledge sharing one-hour workshop? I don't know, because that obviously wouldn't really be personalized for the most accurate person if there's 10, 15, 20 people on that call.  Yeah.

25:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't think it's square that circle. There are different things. So I think that it's either a group workshop that is free and used as for client acquisition or is a more limited workshop for people that have the same problem and have scored similarly on the  on the assessment, but that's a scheduling nightmare. it's either the workshop is generic and everybody can take it or it specializes in you only expect one person at a time to take it.

26:11 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, but I think our goal was definitely as a cat hall saying to run once a month on going to It's a lead to Magna to get people in and have conversations about relationships.  Thinking about this guy. So yeah, I don't looking at the Liam thing. I don't see how that's going to fly.

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so let's think about this. So with Liam, you've created an email sequence that goes after the diagnostic, right?

27:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Can you just repeat that?

27:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the work you did with Liam, this most recent, I know you guys have been working together for a while, but this most recent was the email sequence, correct?

27:28 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  The intro series, yeah. Okay.

27:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. The diagnostics tool, is that tool you've sent me in the past, the Excel file?

27:42 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, because I'm kind of thinking about what else.

27:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. In terms of the workshop, I think you now have two philosophies, free for all, premium individual, right? Free for all would happen here.  Premium individual would happen here. I don't want a premium individual that's small.

28:34 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think that's like the sales call to do with someone that has a problem and there's a funnel. When I was talking to Liam, he was saying I think what specific problem the one workshop solves, highlight your way of solving that problem, but one specific problem has expressed by your clients.  For example, it's we've always We're trying to figure out who ICP is and how to position ourselves against a competition.  Now I think you're not sharing your screen. I remember this, but I don't think you're sharing your screen.

29:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you see it now?

29:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so you can see. I remember you sent me these on the email. Yeah.

29:31 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I mean, that's how we ended up kind of this ICP thing rabbit hole. Can we put up on a vitamin to a pain?  a strategic problem? These are hard strategic problems that make it difficult to run a workshop.

29:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is interesting. In your opinion, the hard. The strategic problem makes it harder to run a workshop. Okay.  Why? Why do you think why do you think that? It's too broad Okay, but how do you how do you currently address those things that you this pretty because you deal with this strategic things, right?  Marketing strategy.

30:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah It's an understanding business and then tatering the different things It's like always on the second journey up a mountain, and we're always doing it together I'm helping on it.  They're like for example now my clients are hiring I just went the process of interviewing And screening a candidate a marketing manager for the head of marketing So helping the head of marketing with hiring a marketing manager.  I'm so that's like quite strategic I think that person is I There's an okay go ahead.

31:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, please go. No, there's there's an aspect which is kind of the expertise format fit kind of like this.  So if you're to remember that two by two with the neurosurgeon, the psychotherapist, the nurse, the general. Yes. Okay, so well, when when you talk about like examples from your work, I the thing that the way I interpret that there's there's a little bit of going high going low and high going low right you get strategic but then you help them like hire people which has a huge lever but it's a bit more closer to the implementation aspect.  Is this roughly accurate?

31:58 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You're asking is it is my support pricing a custom delivery, custom pricing. Very far from productization. Why? Because I'm not solving a concrete, repeatable, specific problem.

33:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But you do have problems that you notice that they're more frequent? 100%. There's a lot of very common frequent problems here.

33:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay.

33:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So would it make sense just to think in terms of a matrix of like offer matrix? So let's say sometimes either this thing and it belongs actually this is the process you do and sometimes you do this thing and you follow this other process, right?  And basically the whole interpretation is The eggnose and prescript. What is this? Roughly. Because I might, okay, let me tell you a personal story because I think this is somewhat familiar.  It's not uncommon that I enter a project and I eventually find myself because I'm faster than teaching the client how to do it.  Just sharing my screen and going, hey man, this is how you can do it and start doing it. And then suddenly I'm helping them set up JIRA boards and stuff like that, which is not part of the work, but really, really unlocks a lot of things for them because they would never do it.  They don't know how to do it.

34:56 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So when I do that, I do it from a place of trying to be helpful.

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it also messes up a little bit of how they see me, because then they start seeing me like, oh, this is really helpful, multi-disciplinary and that can think deeply about things, but also help me with tools.  I don't like to find myself in this pattern, but I do it often. Is this somewhat related? No. Okay.  Good for you.

35:24 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Because I only help on marketing and sales related topics, so they don't bring me into product or development or this stuff.  But I am interested in ARR growth, and I'm blocking growth, and I do will try and support if I can.  So if they're like, hey, I'm hiring a good product person, and I was like, okay, I cannot skin my network to see if I know anyone.  But I start jumping on the calls with a product team to try and help them in product. I do stick to my lane which is marketing and with one of our clients I did talk about hails today like reviewing the job spec for his sales director role and telling you that I can support into interviewing the process and give an opinion on a person with another good fit and that's a bit of a stretch for me but it's still within the main of marketing sales got it okay so with the problem let's turn back a little bit what do you think is the problem we're trying to solve with the workshop my problem or a problem for other people for your business for orange business we have that if you go to the left and to the desired outputs to table yeah that one the green green stickers workshop parameters all of this outcome for me no I know but like what's this is  uh desire right but there's there's something right now so you mean something that precedes that no it's like why why workshop right um I think I think just if I am even more transparent the the next the next stage in the data so you see my video with flirting in the bar uh I think I saw parts of it I don't it didn't see the whole thing but I think I saw like the beginning no of what of the video yeah wasn't there like a short video on LinkedIn no talking about your content on LinkedIn as a whole so my video on LinkedIn as a whole is flirting me and the prospect then the workshop is like we're going to the date because they committed to like spending time with me and then getting married is I guess is like a power alcohol which is like I don't a pre-married   and then there's the getting married which is the retainer and right now I'm jumping straight to the retainer that's my offer say hey let's do a retainer so now I have like the intro series which is meant to be top of the funnel linkage from intro diagnostic into a strategy call so my pre-marriage my I guess whatever before my writers is I guess I don't know is is the is the power our call the strategy call and the power our strategy call I guess I just see that what pre-empts that is the is this workshop I think I see the workshop as another top funnel activity that's one step beyond the video that gives people a feel for engaging with me okay so

39:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or we have the diagnostics.

39:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, the ideal would be that the workshop becomes another monetizable, another way to monetize. But I think it's better to validate it for free before I try and monetize and get people in for it paid.

39:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this roughly accurate?

39:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I wouldn't say the diagnostic and the workshop are the same. So there's no serious, just a tool. I think I'll be linked in content.  Then workshop.

40:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the Ignasiq tool is just auxiliary. I don't know where to put the Ignasiq tool. I think it just sits outside of the funnel.

40:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's just a support tool that helps the process.

40:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so if we are still thinking about the workshop at this stage, it clearly is a group workshop, then the tension is making it broad enough but useful enough, right?

40:36 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, that's a challenge. It needs to be a broad enough problem, that's common.

40:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

40:57 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  That's something specific enough that we can

41:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can't in a workshop and one of the things that useful we are assuming that useful equates with specific but it's not the same thing so it's separate this yeah let's say I'd say specific is a dimension of useful it's different dimensions when we make something useful but I'd say specific tends to be something more specific tends to be more useful like for yeah but for instance let's say that you have a workshop that's just helping this is a example right just helping clients get their first stand LinkedIn posts out right something like this you could give them like like super generic advice yeah and it could still be useful I'd say it's a

42:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Limited use compared to specific Yes, okay, yeah, it's really different it affects is Yeah, because we know this because otherwise everyone who's producing content on LinkedIn for free Wouldn't be producing LinkedIn content for free Because The reason they do it is it's a generic abroad it gives a sense and then if you want personal advice You reach out to that person for support, right?  Mm-hmm. So people obviously they're they're paying Everyone pays for something specifically when you go to doctor is there shortage of medical advice on the internet?  No, so why are you going to see a doctor if there's Medical advice that's prolific because it's not relevant to you.  So specific is all about relevancy Mm-hmm But yeah, I mean is it generally broadly useful do we still read about medical things online we do right?  So it's the inundiscovery process, it is useful, but we still go see the doctor to get an expert opinion.  I guess if you ask me the key challenge we have here, is we are still not clear on what is a specific enough problem that is broadly applicable that can be done in a group setting within an hour.

43:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. So I think we should go back to this thing. And we change the criteria. And it runs in an hour.  Hour. It. Okay, so something like this, and then we start adding some other options. We need to generate some ideas for this, and then we score this, and then we see if any of them makes more sense.  We know that we have some idea around the ICP defined workshop, right? What other things come to mind when you think about the workshop based on your process.

44:56 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You mean the bottom right bit or the whole thing?

45:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The thing, of all the problems you solve right now, problems you're experiencing that solving, right? Let's just bring them up, the ones that you're already working on or already do stuff, doesn't have to be anything new.  What things do you already help people with? Or if you prefer, we can try to go back, perhaps in even better ways, just we come here and we use each one of these for the scoring matrix, right?  You put each one of these nine things into the scoring matrix. But I think it's still a little bit generic.

45:50 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm just thinking through, why don't we go client by client? So with leapfrog, we just ran the workshop. of two sessions, a little bit with sales process, then we created one of the new CLE program.  We created this, you know, I helped them with sales process, and then I helped them with the outbound messaging, helped them with sourcing and screening, someone to help them with CLE, for outbound execution, looking at triggers and list building, target list building for ideal customer profile, ICP.  I mean, the ICP is definitely coming up very often across all the clients as a theme. ICP won't be previously  quite common. With Redbrain, it's the orchestration of the marketing strategy. I'm helping them with the brand agency, supporting on that process.  then we've got a proof of concept that we're launching, account-based marketing proof of concept. So that reviewing LinkedIn ads, created for LinkedIn, the management of LinkedIn ads, freelancer, I pour in.

47:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just a second, let me try to organize this better because I come here. Sorry for interrupting, otherwise I'll just say things and I won't be able to capture them.  So this is for Libfrog, and then what was the Redbrain? Yeah.

47:52 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So for Redbrain, what did you do? Redbrain, supporting on the branding agency. Okay, then creating the proof of concept, account based marketing proof of concept.  This is a LinkedIn ad support, mostly creative, so it's reviewing the LinkedIn ads for them, create POC, support and branding agency, that's Redbrain, then we've got Hogg, I'm here, I am, what do we do with Hogg versus POC?  So we just did that last week. We've got another one this week. So here's your alignment. that's quite high value.  I mean, we just did that red brain as well, but like a low attach variant. Then I've got, I don't know how say it's a Q.  I'll add it here. I'll add it to you. I'll the strategic alignment session as well. So I'm So I'm just going to do a little round.  So those are my current four clients. I just had a few prospects.

50:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They take up so much time and energy and then they don't buy.

50:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's very annoying. But I think I've only got one prospect that looks potentially promising and she needs help with that attribution.  But obviously the scope would extend beyond the attribution if I close them. But you can see like almost all of this is like, I mean, I guess there is the ICP list building for Redbrain as well.  Kind. Has it come up with? Not really. I mean, these are like very everything's custom. There's convert into a repeatable problem with other than the ICP ListBuild language that's back to where we were.

51:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what I'm looking at is that the support shows up six times, review shows up two times, and then other things are a little bit more their own categories, right?  But another check. So you have support at six, strategic at three, and review at two times. And these are difficult things to turn into a product for sure.  Of these things, I think the one that is the most conducive to a workshop is probably the alignment thing.

52:40 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I can't do that. It's a workshop. It's entirely about their business and their priorities and internal discussion and thinking it through, discussing it, seeing the gaps between people and the team, and aligning on activity.  There's nothing. It's impossible to do with stakeholders outside from different businesses.

53:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So of these things, talent is also something that doesn't seem, it's either like creating a job description or something.  It be like a workshop thing, I would imagine, but I don't know. I can see it within the realm of possibility, but...

53:37 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I can do that once I've got my tool ready, but then it's kind of a cool way to sell my tool, which is, you know, how to use this tool to build up job spec.  Using data, but that's not really... That would just be a mechanism for selling the tool. So not for now.

54:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we are back either at ICP or messaging. I think I don't really want to do because that's like lean as we met.

54:15 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm supposed to messaging is already kind of already assaulted as a frame as a method as like a framework for that and a way to run that workshop.  So that's ICP.

54:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think also. So I see me right.

54:54 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It can be so many different things right.

54:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. There's not a lot of tasks and things to do inside of ICP.

55:07 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think there's like, don't know, but okay.

55:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Think about this. Yes, there's a sequential process about going to do it.

55:15 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  it's not like, it's not like there's a lot of, there's only a certain number of ways you can cut a cucumber.  Yeah, I get it. I get it.

55:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But what do you think is the main reason why people need help with ICP?

55:33 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think they may not know how to do it. Why they don't know?

55:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's the blocker to them knowing it? In your opinion, of course.

55:48 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, that's a good question. Thank you. Now practically with Redbrain they've got 6,300 clients, they just haven't put it into clay when Richard to define and build the list with hog they tried one and it didn't work so that pivoted to a different target but they had like relatively loose definition of grouping and with leap frog he hasn't figured it out yet he's still going to market and figuring it out then hands HQ have a very well defined clearly like well articulated definition of the ICP so  Frog is also the just didn't do it argument, right? And the leap frog Haven't figured it out. Okay Because it's not like Everything is an hypothesis, right?  So no, yeah, but I don't know if the issue is Like I was helping him do it I was going to sales navigator Looking at the job titles trying to understand how many people there are in each tube title and in their list of businesses So kind of talking it through thinking it through and getting data to back up the rationale But really the goal was to for to to micro segment for outbound So the purpose wasn't just defining ICP, but to practically deploy it for In segments for But how many of them  a donor. I guess the problem is because I haven't actually defined the process clearly, I haven't, it's not like I've done it so many times over and over again, but it's not clear to me if my thinking of how to do it and how it should be done is necessarily thorough or superior to the way these people are currently doing it, hacking it together.  They're going to be the hacking it and they're getting 99% of the way there. I'm creating a workshop to get people over to 10% and that's like a nine to half rather than a last half.  Now I think the problem is even though I know ICP is a common issue and it's something I should have a codified process for ideally is it something I've actually done or have a codified process for to justify.  So in a way running a workshop something I haven't really created is probably a relatively high risk endeavor.

59:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I think there's two ways of looking at that. let me just organize my thoughts. So the first one is maybe there are experts on ICP that know more about these than you do.  But relatively, comparatively speaking, might not be the global expert on ICPs, but in the context of your clients, you are perhaps one of the local experts, right?  I don't know.

59:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  There's no ICP expert per se. I think ICP is just one of the Yeah, I understand.

59:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  one of the reasons that people ask for your help on different things that they trust you, right? And they see that you can probably believe it.  And they get this feeling and they come to you with challenges. And I'm betting that sometimes some of those challenges are not super well-defined.  They just trust that you will be serious about this and throw about this. One of the reasons, I'm not saying it's the only reason, but one of the reasons.  So it could be the case that you have an expert's POV, which is, by default, very critical and demanding and serious, so to say, right?  The other thing is, another possibility, and maybe these things interact, don't know. It's that you do have a system, but you don't see it because it's like unconscious competence.  I don't know you ever spoke about this, but I think the term is kind of self-explanatory. I'm translating freely from, I'll just use another word, unaware competency, right?  Maybe I'm really good at ICP but you don't even notice it because it's been a while and you can see like your shortcomings on it because you're very clever and you see these things but you might be assuming a ruler that very few people have and what you know is already useful for a lot of people so you wouldn't need to know more about it, right?  For it to be useful. The third one I think it's kind of modernist versus post-modernist view on this which is  like is there a truth with the capital T or there isn't any truth and and maybe this is also something that makes you want to know more about ICP because there's something to be figured out with some finality like oh this is it right the ICP final answer but maybe there isn't such a thing I don't know these are like three related things that come to mind in terms of how you're thinking about your capacity for helping people with their ICP you

1:03:02 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm just reading a blog post around how to define, so I went to Proplexity AR.

1:03:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I thought you were blown away by my explanation, and now I realize you're reading Proplexity. Now go ahead, go ahead.  Well, I guess it's defining the different people who may need or want the ICP definition, right?

1:03:29 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Mm-hmm. Yeah, essentially what you were, is this image, which I just pasted into the mirror? Mm-hmm, yeah. Right, so they're unaware of that, need to ICP, they're aware, need to define it, but they haven't done it.  They're aware, there's maybe solutions, they're aware of someone here. can help them do it, I'm there at most aware, I've already done it and I know to do it.  But I don't know if that helps us in any meaningful way. Well, I'm looking at what is the actual template for defining the ICP, because potentially if we look at it and it's something that we couldn't make an on-the-watch shop with, the temperature will help validate the thinking on it, but I don't know where the template is because I submitted my email and should have sent it to me and it hasn't.  But let me just hold you right there for a second.

1:04:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One of the things that you've mentioned, like since Our first conversations, I think, was like your desire for marketing to be a little bit more rigorous or something along these lines.  Like, oh, I should have studied maybe engineering. I think this is at some point and it's very coherent that we are now doing like live research on what are the actually, you know, good ways of defining an ICP, right?  But my thinking on this is it's a little bit like trying to climb up a hill to know everything, like there's a hill of competency, right?  You climb up this hill and is the hero of knowing how to define it in the ICP. But as you go up this hill, it realize, oh my God, there's other hills over there that they're kind of related to ICP.  And now I realize that I should know more about those things and like, it's not like you're Confidence is increasing your competence is not the confidence because you see more of what you don't know, right?  And my suspicion is I don't know that I think you probably know enough about ICP to do a cool ICP workshop because You've done this enough times that people ask you for it and you can deliver and people seem to like it you get like testimonials and case studies There's no better ICP I get that for like generating results to extend beyond it.

1:06:38 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but for instance The other day I saw this quote and I thought it was really interesting which was like somebody wanted to know what they think about something So they wrote a book on it, right and The act of writing book forces you to learn about the thing and to realize what you what your opinion on it and and so on so  If I got this right, if the match between the problem they have and something you can help points towards ICP, yeah, sure, there's things that we can do to deliver even more value in helping them define an ICP, but I'm pretty sure that you can, with what you know now, with jumping into another rabbit hole, do something that is helpful and valuable for people, without having to play the game of becoming like an expert at ICP, because you're very aware of how further this could be, this is kind of the curse of knowledge, you know, in a sense, you know, you know enough to trip you up the search for more knowledge, what you know is almost certainly enough to start helping people.  Just getting people sign up, would be like just tricking them. Yeah, it is enough for tricking up for sure, but I know that that's not what you want.  But I think it's enough for helping some of them. And if we select the audience right, for helping most of the people that participate.

1:08:20 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm with you.

1:08:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I don't think the problem we need to solve right now is the problem of figuring out what's the best way, the absolutely best way of defining ICP and then from that create a workshop.  Because this is an infinite task. The more we know about the ICP, the more new ones we have, and we fall again into the trap of knowing so much that we lose interest in this thing and we just try to research about some other things.  So I think the challenge we have right now is like, oh, are we confident enough that people have an issue with ICP and that we know  have to start solving that. I suspect we do. And then we look for information that we find that we think it's missing.  So it's more like just-in-time knowledge instead of just-in-case knowledge, right? And we can start building an ICP kind of journey, ICP defining kind of journey, and then realize, oh, at this point, maybe we don't have enough information.  And then we do a quick detour on a complexity, and we figure that out and bring it in, right?  But kind of time box it. Otherwise, this will be like an infinite thing. It will never end. So my suggestion is we can start to put together what are the basic steps of what you do today without checking other sources.  How do you think about ICP? And then we see the holes, and then we see what could be improved.  But we start by- the you do the ICP mapping thing. And we can do it right now. I'll bring it to me and do a little bit of that process mapping thing, but just focused on the ICP, what kind of questions you ask, what kind of things you're interested in figuring out when you're working with clients to fix their ICP.

1:10:33 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So we've honed in and agreed that ICP is the way forward for the workshop?

1:10:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so, yes. I think ICP is a good one. It ultimately is a decision of yours. But from my perspective, I think ICP is a good one.  It's like the only option.

1:10:51 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I don't think we've come up with anything else that's more appealing or concrete.

1:10:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. OK. OK.

1:11:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  fix ICPs.

1:11:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can role play this, right? You can ask me to pretend to be somebody else, and we just role play this thing.  Let's say we never spoke, I said, Oran, please, my ICP is hurting. Fix my ICP. would you ask me?

1:11:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  First, I'd say this is a good criteria. Just find where everyone's gone. I can put the image in. There we go.

1:11:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I see it.

1:11:49 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'll put it next to our work stage.

1:11:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this yours? No. Okay, so rules of engagement. for this section of our session together, everything we do now happens inside this tab, we don't go looking for anything else.  Just for like half an hour and then we open the floodgates to information.

1:12:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Sure, so I'm in good proxy here with the, we need to define the thermographic and then the ideal vipersona.  The thermographic really consists of, you know, number of employees, industry, locations and probably potentially ethnographic profile alongside graphic. Okay.

1:13:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what does that mean?

1:13:08 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Technographic, what it means? Uh-huh, yes, yes. It's the, like, if a company uses Shopify, then the technical profile will show me all the websites that contain Shopify.  Okay.

1:13:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of, like, the variables you collect for that is, like, text tag, that kind of thing?

1:13:31 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, there has to be publicly identifiable tech. Mm-hmm. Given the theory there are vendors that allow you to identify the patterns that are not publicly available, but that's a niche player and it's probably outside the scope of the workshop.  Mm-hmm.

1:13:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So at this point I could tell you, oh, yeah, Orrin, we use a, we know we're calling And they use notion a lot.  Is this something that's relevant? And you would say yes, that's technographic.

1:14:05 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes. Okay, okay.

1:14:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, what else?

1:14:12 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Potentially funding stage within employee industry location. So it's not a separate one, it's within the employment employees.

1:14:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. Okay. Why funding stage? Okay, let me make a difference. Lauren, why is it important for us to know the funding stage of our clients?  What changes?

1:14:35 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Maybe the targeting businesses just raised the A rounds because their solution meets that criteria and helps them the most.

1:14:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, are there characteristics of a product that are more useful for companies that just close an A round as compared to a C round or a C round?  Probably not. Okay, okay. Cool. What else? else?

1:15:03 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It could be just a part of the trigger that is for outbound. So it's like I just need to know who raised money so I can target them.  Find old-fashioned retailers who just raised money. Because that's a good opportunity to sell. Mm-hmm.

1:15:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What? And so raising money is trigger? Is a signal?

1:15:27 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Raising money is a trigger. Okay. I can't remember the difference between triggers and signals. But don't check, don't check now.

1:15:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's just call it trigger slash signal. Okay. Okay, cool. What else? mean, yeah, we have this software. We know they use Notion and we know they are like based in Central Europe, I don't know, and they have 15 employees.  really, you work for the mining industry. What else do we need to know about our ICP?

1:16:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I guess depends if you define the ideal by persona as part of the ICP and some people confuse them.  Oh, okay. What's your expert opinion on that? We don't know about expert opinion. I just have an opinion. Some people call me an expert.

1:16:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

1:16:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I see experts on the invoice.

1:16:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I say you are the expert when I talk to my secretary. yeah, you are the expert.

1:16:35 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So if you have a person, a buyer, that's a persona. That's a buyer persona, IVP. So a buyer persona is a subset of your ICP.  Oh, okay, okay. Are you setting for like CTOs in fashion or CTOs in fintech? but two very ICPs, same biopersona, in terms of job title, but job title, one aspect of the ideal biopersona, the three dimensions, so the first is the jobs to be done, like where they need to get done, the second is the job title, which is demographic, and the the criteria, so this is the criteria for the psychographics, it could be there's a conditional criteria, it's arguable, which could be mapped, I think you can't map it externally, it's only part of the sales process, which is this one.

1:18:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, and so we have this kind of we have a feeling about these things right we we think we know who our ideal by person is because we had a guy we had another marketing consultant I think at the end of 23 he helped us with some stuff I'll ask people to send you the reports maybe you can go through them but we don't have a lot of we're not sure that we're doing it right so you're saying that our ICP needs to include like firm or graphic okay the technographic interesting I didn't hear I have not heard about that before but I see the point the ideal by a persona cool this connects with what people told us in the past as well I see that you have your own way of thinking about this which is interesting and what other like main things we should  to the fry to be or are there on other iron well do you have existing clients or not because if you do then we need to look at that list and extract their current characteristics to identify who is the ideal customer profile whether you have clients I think we did that in the last call we flushed out that flow mm-hmm so let's say still rolling right so let's say we do have some clients but we have this new product and maybe we are changing a little bit of the ICP and I think there are things we can use from our past clients but maybe there's like new things that we don't know about future clients because you know changing the product seems to have changed that I do think we should explore that like getting this  ground level of understanding of ICP so we can build up other things because right now it's all but it all feels a little bit flimsy we have it we have some PowerPoints with it we have some PDFs with it we never feel like absolutely sure that we're doing the right thing we're doing something but we're not we're doing the right thing you know can you help us with that what's your question so I think our paint point is how much can trust our current ICP definition we have something but we don't know if we can you know really put a lot of money behind it and invest in all the other motions that we need to do yeah often it's too broad and the other day I thought there's someone and they said them companies with more than 500 employees mm-hmm so that's your  ICP and he's like yeah right why not just people who can breathe just hug everyone if we get just one  of those I mean we're golden exactly so the key is kind of niching down to who is will benefit the most really and how do we know that because yeah currently I like our dilemma is this like we have some clients we've been serving some clients some of them become repeat customers so it's in that reading something right for them but now we're trying to export this new direction with a new product that we are launching and it doesn't seem like the new the old clients are the same ones that would benefit the most from this right so we just have a lot of uncertainty around our ICP I mean what we have is might be a little bit broad but it's not fully insane there's there's some results for me from our current thing  So, yeah, we need your help to figure out, correct our ICP in a way that will give us confidence to make investments that are sizable enough to actually get the results.

1:22:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  What would be interesting is actually, just thinking about it, creating a component like a basic canvas. So, now we're not, you're talking to Zhuo now, okay.  That's like value mapping, mapping the value of the product to the personas. I think it would look like feature, benefit, pain.  And then why is it relevant for that, for that ICP or by a persona, but not this one. So forcing the user to think about the mapping and the forcing of the narrowing down of the criteria.  So if we could do that, that could actually be a pretty cool output. Okay, okay.

1:23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for the sake of not jumping, I think that's a very interesting direction. But just for the sake of taking ourselves, my suggestion as usual, not the role-play character, would be to, let's explore this a little bit better, because it's an interesting hypothesis for a pain point they have, right?  Connecting their multiple initiatives and products to their ICPs. the solution that you're probably going be raised, you're like, you don't have data to go after.

1:23:51 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay, so map out what you do, questions of who you want to target, and evaluate what you do and who's going to benefit the most.  But to do that, I need to give you a tool to help you do it. So I was like, oh, why don't we create a canvas that helps people do that?  No, I disagree with the idea.

1:24:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't disagree with the idea. It's just that this is a very common pattern in a conversation like this.  Not with you, but with everyone, which is like, as we explore the problem, an idea comes up and it feels very enticing.  then we go into it and we stop. We don't, you know, book and the exploration. And if later on that idea, we find some fragility with it.  We are left with no idea and no complete diagnosis process, right? So we have that idea. It seems promising.  I like the idea. But I'm just nudging it towards, OK, OK, we just saved it. We put it on the parking lot.

1:24:51 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  What I was saying now, I wasn't pushing towards creating the idea. was giving you context as to why went there.  No, I understand. I understand context.

1:25:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so one of the, let me try to role play again.

1:25:08 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So we have this, so you don't know, so you don't have any customers right now for this new product?

1:25:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We don't have a scalable way of getting them. what we have right now is that we have some customers that are like friendly and we've shown them stuff.  And they're like, okay, this is interesting.

1:25:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I don't think it's for me, but I know someone.

1:25:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then they refer us because it's just...

1:25:30 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Have you mapped them out? Have you mapped out other characteristics like the industry, the job title? Do you have a clear idea of the profile?  I think it's all in my head, but it's not clear.

1:25:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, whenever I talk to someone from our team, I might be forced to extract that, but we never put it into paper, no.

1:25:50 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So how are you, how is your team clear and aligned with who to target? They are not.

1:25:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, it's just based on the hunch and sometimes... we will notice and I think that's the point that what we feel is that okay we need a definition cool let's define this but every time we try to sit down to define this thing we are not sure we can do it alone and we're like oh this ICP thing is really strategic it's really important if we don't nail it it will just be burning money right and this happens in the context of everything else right so we get into these meetings with my my closer team my executive team and everybody sees and feels the problem and everybody understands that we need to get an ICP definition but then we have like one and a half hours scheduled and somebody's getting emails about something that broke or a client that needs attention and in this turmoil we have two choices either we stay with a weird job of defining the ICP which is something we're not very comfortable doing or we just fix a problem of  about the business as usual. And what happens usually is just get distracted, don't look at this because we don't have to deal with it and go just fix the old problems that we always had.  So I think what we lack is the confidence that it's worth it to put in the time, our time, to fix it in a way that will have confidence that you can trust it.  So what we don't want is, OK, let's set aside half a day and the whole executive team will do this.  And that's really expensive, right? And then we do it and we spend the day to make that time investment and attention investment.  But when the time comes for us to pull the trigger on, like a big ad spend or big motion, go to market motion, we're like, yeah, but I remember when we did this and everybody was a little busy and can we really trust this thing we did?  So this is my feeling. Maybe the executive team would have a different one, but I think this is why we are not really being explicit on the ICP.  Okay, so yeah, so it's not really a question is, mean, I'm just, can you help us, can you help us, I know, capture these ideas we have around ICP in a way that is structured enough that we feel confident about it.  And I think we trust you, you are an expert, I think if you help us do it by default we will trust more than if we did it ourselves.  But also, yeah, in a way that fits with our current challenges. our, we have challenges about the ICP, which is we have new products, and maybe the ICP has changed, that's one kind of challenge.  And we have the other challenge, is getting to the ICP, like we don't have the skills to craft our ICP thing.  So we are stuck in this, we need an ICP, we don't know how to make an ICP. So I think.  That's why we need your help.

1:29:03 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, so just paste it into here the output of different challenges, numbering godness of.

1:29:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so now I exit the roleplay mode and of all the things around an ICP, what is it a one thing we could perhaps get them to start to do in one hour, even if it doesn't finish in one hour that maybe it's something it's like a trial on software, right?  Like they will get the feeling how it is to work with you, but they won't be able to finish the whole thing they might need to get  of your help of your paid help in the future, right? Yeah, so what's one thing that you think that in one hour, I can make them see the value of this?

1:30:18 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think it would be the kind of value you ICP mapping.

1:30:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This thing, right? This thing at the top. Yeah, okay.

1:30:32 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  With an output for the ICP workshop, the worksheet similar to the last. So this model of like criteria, who to sell to, you know, Tony Seltzer, if it's inbound, and who to disqualify.  It's quite a nice thing about it. But then I can help them like go in and define and think about actually pulling the data so they can try and size that market into the number of companies or number of people to target so we jump into sales navigator and run how to how to actually get the list target list so now not just with a worksheet but some sort of data-led approach to thinking it through theoretically could take them through like a prompting exercise on cloud which is an indication of a synthetic data so they go through a series of problems they put in the context for who they do what they do  by the prioritized list of where they should go after, with the arguments, and this is for them to validate their thinking events.  It would be a pretty productive hour. Mm-hmm. Maybe too much for the moment. It seems to me that's too much.

1:32:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this too much, I think, on different directions. So one of the directions that I think is too much is that you can only move as fast as the slowest guy on the call.

1:32:34 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So yes, maybe some people are brilliant and they get it.

1:32:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But others will not. So it's different to do this one-on-one. And people will be paying attention. Like, you are now paying attention to me.  And even though, like, if you open a tab and you search for something, go ahead. I'm going to time-box that.

1:32:57 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So like, you know. Create your ICPs that you believe you currently have. We've got 50 minutes to do it.  I'm here for support. Pay me questions in the chat with any questions you have and I'll answer in the chat.  Everyone go. Then they go, I'm in the chat replying to the people who've got questions and answers. They're fleshing out their individual worksheet with their target industry location, number of employees, operations, teams, and ideal by personas.  So we've got a few worksheet templates. They fill that out and we do one, then we do the other.  So of course you do your ICP, then you do your ideal by persona. And then I walk them through the value mapping exercise and how to prioritize and think about it.  OK, so no prompting in no LinkedIn sales navigate. I didn't the prompting can be done after there's a video, a bonus video.  Watch and then see and I can give them the prompts to feed in. well, it doesn't have to be in the hour.  And if I'm like, you know, I have time, then I can do it live. And then start taking them through it.  So if I'm running short, I can backfill with that. So the backup plan. Yes, I'm, which I'm raising through.  hmm. With the sales now, I think it's like showing them how to do it. But not necessarily doing it there live with them on the field.  Mm hmm.

1:34:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I like the idea of the bonus, because you can also use the bonus for incentivizing people to actually show up, right?  So one of the things of free events, webinars, workshops, so on, is that you get like, maybe 50% of the people that sign them.  A lot of people sign up and then they don't show. And if you have content that doesn't feel in the doesn't fit in the in the session, you can always use that as a character, like  If you show up and you stay until the end, I'll send you the link to this thing, right? And that that's just useful, increase the value for the thing and not too much work to make.  OK, so in one hour, it will time-box it. Cool. Even with time-boxing, you are a little bit limited in how many questions you can ask, because every time you ask a question that people need like five minutes to answer.  15 minutes is too much, I think, most times. And less people are. You can give people like 15 minutes if they are like in a breakout room to discuss things.  But if you leave them alone for 15 minutes, I think you run the risk of losing a lot of them.  it can do breakout rooms.

1:35:52 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I can break out the room. That's nice, because if I break out the rooms, I can then go and hop into each room, support them.  people see if any questions come up then I bounce from room to room during that period and then they can fill it out.  I'm engaged in conversation so I'll have a discussion around that. Would there be any logic to the way you break the rooms or just random zoom thing?  Yeah just randomly split them up and then I get them to fill in the worksheet for like minutes and then 10 minutes discussion in their group so they'll fill it out so it's 15 minutes during the group they fill it out and then they discuss it and then like the group's kind of providing feedback and they provide like some sort of scorecard on the thinking on the feedback so like you know how specific is this how realistic is it um how clear is it how how how easy is it to I  to five people that have this problem or challenge. I think the key here is to maybe extend the ICP beyond a static definition.  Why? Into thinking about like triggers or signals. And the reason why is because that's not easily available online for people to think about and stitch together in the context of ICP.  So if I just give them the list, and it's like these are all the different signals or triggers, scan through, identify one or two or three signals that you think are most likely related to be associated with as a buying signal that's good for you to reach out to this business.  Now the goal that isn't for you to necessarily identify the signal is to get you thinking beyond the static target list.  into thinking about how to become timely and relevant to your potential buyer to instigate a conversation. So yeah, it's like proper marketing.

1:38:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so Correct me if I'm wrong, there's the ICP canvas, there's the IVP canvas and there's triggers.

1:38:25 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Look a trigger list that they can go through to try and identify When the ICP IVP in market potentially for the solution was a good time to try and reach out to them.  I Mean this is a hypothesis because Could be the trigger list is maybe too long or too cognitively demanding.  It could be it's not viable But I I'd say it's an it's unusual twist to this. That's very relevant and timely and modern That makes this much more interesting than unusual compared to where you can just read online about defining your ICP  Essentially, you do agree with me. If I can go through Google, type in how to create an ICP list, and I come to the workshop with ORION, and there's no difference for the majority except to get word's opinion, there's a relatively limited value.

1:39:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Up to a point, yes. At some point, there's also, so I agree with you that actually it's also good when people come to your workshop and they have some expectations about ICP, and then you confirm those expectations.  So this relates to that Maya thing we spoke earlier. Like, if you only show them completely new things, they might trust that you know stuff, but they feel a little bit, OK, this new information, they need more time.  So it's useful. So also, have parts of it that people are like, OK, This fits with my model of the thing.  But I like idea of the triggers. So what I'm thinking here is for one hour, I think this is quite a bit, even if we take things and put them into the bonus stuff, right, especially for the V1.  As you do this more, and you realize like we don't need as much time here, or I can just change things.  Maybe it's not an hour, maybe it's an hour 15, an hour 30. Yes, for sure. The point is, my point is, you can look at the hours a bit of the price of the workshop, right?  How much time will I need to put into this? We can always change the amount of time, but as it gets longer, it can also start to feel more expensive and harder to say yes to, because you're a busy person.  So, yes, we have some flexibility on that, for sure, yes. But it's best to leave them wanting for more, wanting more than doing them that, okay, this was a little bit too long, right?  It could be the triggers as a bonus as well.

1:41:11 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So it's a video bonus, then sales navigator and the triggers.

1:41:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know what I like a lot about triggers is that so the ACP, it's a relatively famous concept, even if people have misconceptions about it, but it's a relatively famous thing, right?  The IBP is a little bit less so, but it's also very intuitive. Like once you say, oh, it's the person that inside of that org that makes a decision, that's very, oh yeah, for sure, yeah, I need to call this that guy, right?  That's the thing that, and that's a characteristic of cool insight, which is like once you point it out, it's obvious, but maybe Topu didn't know it before.  They'll always remember it because it's self-explanatory, but they never saw it before. So mixing the IVP and the triggers list, I think this is really special.  This is just intuition on my side. You can just tell me to go take a walk. Because these two aspects, they are recognizable enough for people to understand the logic, but they're also different enough for you to stand out from other ICP-definition things.  And we could perhaps shape the workshop around, okay? I don't know. This is bad copywriting, okay? Okay? PCE, figure out when.  Okay, something here, right here. In terms of like, go ahead.

1:43:35 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think it's to maybe, the thing is you say pass the ICP or kind of skip it when people haven't defined the ICP yet.

1:43:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Excellent point, yes. They're not at that stage, they're not that sophisticated. Got it, got it. So in that sense, okay.

1:43:58 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So in that sense.

1:44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we should focus just on the ICP canvas and hint that there's more okay so using the business mobile canvas as an example right if I remember it correctly it's kind of like this uh it's kind of like this right and then this thing and this thing they are defined by the valid proposition right so if you go on to on a workshop from those guys they can start here and then they'll let you know hey by the way we have these other things that also helps with other stuff no and you could do that you could you could have have your ICP canvas and then allude to or even like preview oh there's there's more work to do the ICP is just the beginning it's just a foundation

1:45:06 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Oh, we can just, you know, when I talk about the event that's got title and then the description I go into what it's covering, I mean, it's not major.

1:45:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't understand what you just said.

1:45:20 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Once we, in the event description, we talk about what includes these things. I don't think the title needs to do all the heavy lifting on the content of the...  No, for sure.

1:45:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, no, it doesn't.

1:45:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I agree with you.

1:45:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This thing is, it sidesteps the main thing. So I'm already convinced. I'm already convinced it is not the good name.  So I'm already, I agree. Let's stick with the ICP, right? And if we... want because the workshop is like a gateway to other work from you, right?  So in a workshop, we could either make it self-contained, like do the ICP and the IVP and the triggers, or we could do the workshop as kind of a trial of working with you and then they do the ICP thing, the ICP canvas.  But in the process, you let them know, guys, by the way, there's other parts in this, anyway. But the point is not really so much how you tell them about the point is, if we need to choose what to do, I don't think I'll do all of these three things, but we'll just do the ICP covers, but we'll do it really well.

1:46:45 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So how do you suggest I tackle that?

1:46:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in that sense, we have here your basic, very, very generic approach to exploring all of your clients have their ICP stuff, right?  How much quality they have on the ICP. and mapping, we could start to prototype you and I here. A canvas for that.  So let's say this is canvas, they will work on this, right? And we want to map ICP to a value, right?  Yeah, value. And we'll need to have some characteristics of your product, right? And we connect them.

1:48:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  to characteristics of the ICP.

1:48:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay. I think it would look like this. Okay. Okay. Why? Why? Why did it change the order?

1:48:45 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Because I think the... Okay. Why? Why? you And it's harder for them to understand pain, and it's easier for them to understand benefits.  But that means that they can spend more time going down the wrong rabbit hole. So if I go to pain, they spend less time than going through benefits, writing them, realizing that they then get stuck on the pain tab, and it forces them to do no into empathy.  the reason we start with features, because they've probably already got features that they're pushing off, they believe that they've built for a reason.  The benefits is the articulation of it, but it isn't explicitly necessary. I'm not sure if it's necessary. So when I'm familiar  with this canvas, I've never actually learned how to use it or actually worked with it. So I mean, have you used it?  you familiar with it?

1:50:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I'm not as familiar with others, but I've used it. So basically, the reason I brought this in is that we're kind of trying to replicate this.  And some people might know it. And if they know it, I think it could come across as we just tried to reinvent the wheel.  So if we know what this is, we avoid that, I think. So the customer jobs is this is actually done basically, right?  This is paints is very clear. And this is kind of poorly named, but this kind of expectations and desires.  Okay, so for instance, let's say We are designing a product for design managers, okay, at startups. Job to be done would be like, oh, I need to make sure that my team managed to keep up a good base of delivering really good experiences.  And what's difficult for me is to, you know, manage all these very sensitive, very annoying designers. And I want to get promoted next year for launching a very innovative thing, something like that.  And pain relievers could be, for instance, we have like, I don't know, I don't know what the product is.  It was just thinking is up. Oh, we'll just give you like coaching for dealing with designers. I'm a designer by training, so I know what I'm talking about.  Designers can be very well. I mean, for dealing with, sorry, I was talking. We've gained creators. will, there's, there's like a canvas for for promotion related conversations.  Right. So a design manager could just fill in the, our gets ready for being to promote to being promoted canvas and they will take that canvas to a discussion with a, with a leader and just feel more comfortable knowing that they addressed all points.  And the product of services, it's like, could be like 90-day get promoted as design manager challenge, okay? So I don't know if this was a great example, but this is how this canvas works, and it kind of relates to what you have here.  It's not one-to-one, but it's kind of related.

1:53:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So their gains are expectations and desires. They've got the jobs to be done. They've got their pains.

1:53:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then again, create a canvas for the promotion. Is the solution No, the solution is the product that yeah gets promoted in 90 days challenge Come again, what does I say canvas fun?

1:54:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Now it's for a canvas for promotion Related conversations.

1:54:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes Sorry for the your glyphs, but No, I don't understand what it is. What's a canvas for promotion related conversations?  Okay, let's not collect a canvas a worksheet then Let's say, okay Let's say I'm selling a product that is I'm selling a service that is called the 90 day get promoted as a design manager challenge Okay, this is what I do, right and My clients are the managers at startups, right?  Whatever So I need to figure out what they need to do as part of their jobs to be done  And I need to figure out what's difficult for them, the paints, and what things they're looking to achieve, which is the gains.  I think this was just poorly named. It rhymes, but it's confusing. And if this is my product, 90 days, it gets promoted as a design manager challenge.  What things do I do to alleviate those pains, right? And what do I do to actually create value for them, which is related to their expectations and desires?  And maybe these 90-day get promoted challenge changes on a couple of things. And the main thing is get ready for promotion-related conversations, right?  One of the ways I help you to get ready for those conversations is I give you like a canvas or a worksheet or a script, an artifact that allows you to get ready to prepare for a conversation about getting a promotion.  And this would be probably enough, but if we are competing with other get promoted challenges or other products geared towards design managers.  It's even better if I get some way to relieve other aspects. That's not the main thing, but there are pains that they have, right?  Is this a better explanation?

1:56:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, I understand now. I'm thinking about how this contrasts to what I did above. The main difference is this doesn't really have a feature by feature breakdown.  And also it doesn't really tie it to the IBP and ICP. It just has customer profile, which is essentially ICP.  So it lacks that connective tissue. I'd say yes, is a lot of similarities, but there's my ones different. It's purpose built for  class, this is more generic and more general and it misses the two-step process at the end, but it has in common is pains and benefits and that's fine.  features. Well, yeah, features, but here it's not really, the canvas doesn't, it's not showing you, like, essentially this would be, it would be more like this.  Yeah? No, because the features, they go into the value, into the game creators and the pain relievers.

1:57:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It just forces you to consider, like, this feature I have, that I really like, it's AI, whatever. Does it address an actual pain point or a desire for my customer?  And then you place it above or below. But my point here is not to say that your canvas is the same as this canvas, it's just that if they do similar things, what things can we learn from each other, right?  And one of the things that it could be interesting to explain. So let's say we have ICP, okay, IBP, IBP, ICP, IBP, ready, IBP, right, so the ready IBP includes triggers.  Just thinking, okay, so we could, okay, this was V1, let's go for v2. We could have like this, and this is like this, okay, and the features, okay, and then we map these features to the different stages, okay, what does the stage represent?  ICP, IVP, so some, this is actually, this should be reversed. The stage is, the discussion, this is, the reflection, this is forcing is the things I have as part of my product, do they, do they matter, right, and the most, the most they can matter is, if they connect  the trigger connect to trigger right so let's go for a retreat we have icp we have ibp icp ibp okay now my band i have a  hate mirror sometimes ibp ready ibp okay okay here so let's say we begin with a feature list right and then we place these features from the most generic to the most targeted right with this big kind of a mapping  of the feature to the value. Okay, so this is very ugly, but you get my point. Okay, okay. Now I have this thing.  This thing is white, some post-its going on here. This thing, can I flip it? Just flip it, okay. And now, I put some post-its here.  Is this making sense so far? You

2:03:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You don't convince the features are mapped to the triggers and signals, and not I the assumption here that you've jumped to between v1 to v2 and then v3 and then frame one is that you've made the assumption that you can map features to IBP ready IBP as if they're different which they're not and then I think okay so I think that what the confusion here is there's maybe different features for different IBP  is in different ICPs, different features in one ICP, IBP, and ready IBP.

2:04:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but that, okay, yes.

2:04:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So Yeah, I'd say the ones I created on the left feature, Pay and Benefit IBP ICP is right and then you'd kind of have in market IBP signal and then maybe it's different different ICP.  I mean it is possible you'll have different features for different I.B.P.'s in different I.C.P.'s, so it could be you'd have I.B.P.1, I.B.P.2, I.C.P.1, I.C.P.2.  Yeah, it should look like that. Thank you.

2:06:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So these are two different layers, correct, like this?

2:06:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes. So this would be like your feature maps are paying much more benefit match to let's say. So it's like tangibly do this.  You have a, just thinking about it. Accounting software. You've got feature one, is, I don't know, account reconciliation, pain, manual and spreadsheet.  But if it's faster and cloud based and easy sharing and automated reporting, a deal by persona is your financial controller.  Feature two is for, I don't FD, CFOs, pain, visibility on PNL and balance sheet, benefits, cloud based. rather than spreadsheets, reporting, etc.  IBP1 is the CFO, IBP2 is FD, and there's a signal for FDs, but there isn't one for CFOs, but they're both in pretty tech companies.  ICP2 is like e-commerce businesses with two different features that would benefit different in different industries.

2:07:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean I agree that's the logic, I don't think we can do that in an hour because then the combinations are so many.

2:07:41 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  What do you mean? You shouldn't, they shouldn't be more than like one or two that we're doing in this one hour session and mapping all of the potential, sorry we're giving them the framework to go and crack on and do one or two together and then they go and do the rest of them on.

2:08:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we start with the list of features, set it, so features it, yeah, okay, and then we have some pain points they relate to.  Is that it? Yep. Okay. They should solve a problem. then we have benefits, right? Okay, so my suggestion is that the order is one, two, but then  Actually, the tree is here, which is the benefit. This is actually what they do on the business model campus as well.  There's two different orders that matter. One is the order of using the tool, right? And this is related to the order of going through the process.  And the other is the order of reading the tool, right? So in the business model campus, you don't do it left to right.  You do it right to left, but then you jump around a little bit. So because the point is by the end, you'll have a map of, by the end, it will make sense.  But if you try to fill it in the way it looks, it doesn't make sense. So first, we have a feature.  Here, here, here here here here okay and then I have pain points okay okay okay okay and then this relates to an IVP but they don't know the IVP right so we need to start to go for the ICP let me think let me think no we go for the ICP okay and the ICP is this color let's say this color and finally the IVP is added  So, we have things and these things address pain points. The way they address these pain points is via some benefits.  And then, we know that our ICP is this thing, but actually, the person we need to convince Vince is the IVP.  And how does the IVP signal, that would be the 6th, maybe, no? 6th IVP. What is EM? Is it intention?  In market type? In market type it is. So this is about, where is it? This is about product. This is about kind of pretty big market decision maker.  you for watching. Okay, timing, okay. And this, the order we have right now works best if we already have a product, right?  This is mostly for fixing wrong ICPs, right?

2:13:30 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Well, we have a product where you don't have an ICP definition yet.

2:13:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is not exactly the thing to do if you're starting from zero, right? Yeah. Which is fine.  Yeah.

2:13:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  We should definitely not be starting, yeah. Okay.

2:13:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is for companies that already exist and they have something, and they are a little bit unsure of what they have or what they have is not very high quality.  And we start. We start with the product-centric perspective, but because this is the language they understand. And this is also more certain.  This is more certain. And this is less so. So we need to, this is like an anchor, right? We begin with what we can trust.  And we trust our feature list. We can see it. We see our feature list. And then we do the pain points.  And we only do the benefits after the pain points. And you can also frame this decision, which is a little bit odd, but you can frame it as a commitment on your part, commitment on the part of the expert.  Unlike, it's really important we don't drink our own kool-aid. We need to be ready to realize that maybe what we thought was a benefit doesn't matter to.  to my clients, which is a very common failure mode of these kind of things, right? People just assume, yeah, we have the thing they want for sure.  They just don't get it. It's very usual, right? So we force them to the forcing function. We force them to notice this.  Okay, then we move into the SCP and maybe they have some, this is me just assuming, right? Maybe they have some assumptions here, which are likely to be incomplete, vague, not good enough.  And then we bring in the price, is, hey, guys, actually, you shouldn't stop here at the SCP because it doesn't tell you anything of what you need to do right now.  Knowing the ICP tells you very little. need to know who makes the decisions at those ICPs and you need to know if they're looking for solution, right?  And there's probably a way you think about IVPs, even if it's not explicit. But you probably, when you were working with clients to help them nail their IVPs, probably move away.  You have questions you ask yourself all the time. And then finally, we have the triggers and signals, which is kind of just mixing a list of signals and triggers plus IVP, right?  In-market IVP. It's made of this thing. Right?

2:17:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Like the IBP So Questions around the Questions around the finding I mean, I think I just essentially say I didn't there is a matrix you can use.  It's just Let me just find it. What is it? Champion economic buyer automatic Okay, you have a way of thinking about this

2:18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Champion. Yeah, champion economic buyer. Do you have a list of triggers?

  Can you access this link? Where did you put it?

2:18:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The trend. Yes, I can see it. Can I make a copy of this? I think that what we need to do right now is, we do have a sequence, so we have a sequence of, we have a sequence of activities.  blue to me. We have a workshop goal. We've started to create the visual tool guide. Okay. Do you agree with this recap?  Yeah.

2:20:27 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I mean, these are the four buyers. just pasted it in. That's the four buyers in both the buying committee.  So when it comes to the buyer, the IBP, or the problem, it takes a bit into a sales slam.  I think it's quite a relevant or interesting conversation. Okay, now you're going to, I'm just following your cursor. Okay.

2:21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yep.

2:21:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So you have a sequence of activities, you have a workshop goals, instead of create a visual tool to go to workshop.  Yep. Okay.

2:21:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, and this will help us by, okay. Cool. So, until next session, I think that what would be interesting for you to check out with Liam, because you will check out things with Liam for sure, is how to insert this into this.  Right. And just so we're sure. recurrent model of this is like, yeah, LinkedIn content with LinkedIn content, then there's a workshop, then then there's the support, the diagnostic to power over and retainer, right?  Yes.

2:22:15 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay.

2:22:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, yeah, I think that's it. I don't know.

2:22:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  In a way, it feels like maybe it should be a paid workshop. You're killing me, man. Because we've made this to be generic.

2:22:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, yeah, we can convert it into a paid workshop for sure.

2:22:40 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  How would it be different if it wasn't generic?

2:22:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's a good question. No, my point is basically that is we've spent some time trying to figure out a way of something that we could address in a generic  enough way. Yeah, it works as generic.

2:23:05 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  mean, it doesn't need to be paid. I just think it's like it's got quite a lot of value to it.  It will do a lot of the things I need it to do. Okay. Show people that.

2:23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I interrupted you. sorry. Please go. I feel confident that we do have a good backbone here because we didn't arrive at this from nothing.  was a lot of, you know, discussing how it could look like. And in terms of like, there's a tool.  There's a talking about the tool. There's sharing results achieved with the tool. There's explaining how to use the tool.  There's all sorts of things that you can do with it afterwards. So probably the problem that the problem structure for the workshop will be something like this you'll have a bunch of work areas okay work area for exercise one work area for exercise two and so on and they provide the answers that then later get put into the canvas okay i don't know if is the shape of the canvas is just to give you a feeling and you can go as deep as you want in in any of them like if you want to make like a if you can if you want to turn this workshop from one hour into four hours you just go deeper on each work area right like really deep on the how to identify a champion how to identify the economic buyer you know  have levers and dials, you can adjust to go deep on each thing if you want to, or you can just keep it more generic.

2:25:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  That's pretty good.

2:25:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like that.

2:25:11 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's a fractal, right?

2:25:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I'm sure that if people need you to talk about like any one specific thing about this, you could talk about it for two hours, I think, without notes.  And then let's just give you a tool that supports that kind of expertise that you have at hand. Which is, again, like the way the guys from the Business Model Conference do it.  The Business Model Conference is a famous tool, and you can get these $80 online courses, or you can get like $40,000 after-day things where they use the same thing, right?  They just go on different levels of detail. But yeah, I mean that's it. So for the next session what we should be focusing on is shaping the workshop a little bit more in terms of like okay so now we have 15 minutes for this and this information will be collected with this sort of exercise and this exercise will give us people should answer it in this way and we start to see the workshop taking shape.  But for that to work we need to make sure that we have this foundation agreed upon right like let's build the workshop around this thing.  If that's okay we can do it for sure.

2:26:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay sounds good good.

2:26:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay thank you and this time I got my AI in here so it's fine. Thank you so much. I hope you had fun.  This is brain sweating stuff so I like it. Thank you.

2:27:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It has similarities to writing content. think it's slower. This is a lot of verbal visualizing thinking.

2:27:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, man, I think you're saying nice things, then I cannot hear you. You're cutting off. Oh, you cannot hear me?  Now I can, but for the past 20 seconds I could not.

2:27:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, I saying the similarities to writing, you know there's wastage and things that you need to get rid of, but you're kind of trying to get to the like a cohesive narrative that makes sense and is sensible.  And I think this looks like of the output once they're exposed to it, there's like a framework and a methodology, it looks rigorous, it looks lost, and it looks like it's confidence inspiring.  but yeah, if you zoom out, you zoom out and look at the whole thing we've had to go through, in order to just get to that one thing, which is the output, which is this thing here in the middle, it's quite funny, it's like a lot of processing to try and distill down.  I think it's an interesting process to go through, because I mean, ideally, I'd kind of have different workshops that I can run, so I can alternate every other month, I run a different one, so I have maybe two, three, so once a quarter I do three and the next quarter three, so we've got two more that we can produce, so I think we just need to do this one first, gather, like test it out, gather information, see how it worked.  improve it and then do the next one. Yeah, I like them as like potentially paid work outputs. Like, you know, if I can monetize through kind of similar to like, you know, for sessions we do, right, like you sell a package that's, you know, got a fixed price output is that's much better.  I like it as a shape. And like with my LinkedIn following, I talking to this because I was talking to Liam and we're talking like, had I increased my income?  And obviously, was like, okay, do I go for higher value clients? And he's like, look, with your LinkedIn followers, it makes sense to go for higher volume rather than higher quality, pure.  And this lends itself to that model a lot better. So I like this idea of this becoming free to generate more clients.  But obviously, if I can turn it into something monetizable that's optimal. Yeah, and there's ways, yeah for sure.

2:30:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And there's ways you could later adjust things like if you put in the, if you shape the workshop with like examples from the health industry, right?  It's the same canvas, the same canvas, same structure, but at some point you insert some examples, some industry facts and figures from the health industry, and you shape the way you convey this workshop, you communicate this work, you could sell the same thing for the different markets without having to redo the entire thing, right?  Which again, like this is a really interesting point for again from the business model canvas, which is a huge inspiration, which is they show you how it looks like for Apple, for Amazon, for Spotify, you know, and they automatically show you that oh this is a flexible tool that I can use for many things, right?  So you could Fill it in with fake data as an illustration for oh, this is how it would look like for a software company This is how it would look like for an agency.  This is how it would look like for whatever. So you have flexibility Yeah That's it Aaron really good, I hope you feel better soon and I Think we have another one scheduled if we don't I think Joanne and I will figure it out Amazing Perfecto have a nice one always great to meet you and talk to you your pleasure mate.  See you later
