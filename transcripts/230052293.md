0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This meeting is being recorded. Hello. Hi, Jessica.

0:06 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  How are you?

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, good. Sorry, I always mess up when joining Zoom. Man, your camera is amazing.

0:15 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  It's really good. Thank you. It's actually like a canon on top of my laptop.

0:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay.

0:23 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So like if I were to just be like, this is my MacBook Pro, like it's obviously not. Like a weird thing, but like it's better than my old camera.  But this is my like, this is my camera camera.

0:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's really good. I have one of those like Elgato things, but I didn't set it up. I'm just done.  Thank you. Thank you for setting this up.

0:48 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Are we connected through Lex Roman? Because I was like, I remember like seeing something you posted. think only done about frameworks.  And I'm like, I'm like, how do we like, how do we connect?

0:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it Lex or is it somewhere else? I think it was Lex, yes. think I came across Lex perhaps a year ago or something.  I don't remember exactly how, but I just liked their stuff. And yeah, then seeing people commenting on their stuff, and I think I found you started following you.

1:18 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Yeah.

1:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And that's it, yeah.

1:19 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Awesome. So I'm really glad we're checking. I see framework designer for each consultant season. like, I'd love to know a little more about what you do and how you do it for, because my people all need frameworks.  so, and I'm like, I have frameworks on frameworks, but I need to actually develop my framework. It's so funny, I worked with an illustrator last year.  I have lots of little frameworks, and I'm like, I finally have my big framework, but a lot of my clients need frameworks.  And so I'm like, I want to know what you do for who, how you do it, and see if there's like,

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  opportunity to do something here? Sure, sure. Thank you. I saw, because when you said, oh, let's meet up, I went and I took a look at your post.  I saw there's this season of very visual, the green post, right, which was I was intrigued about that, about the pipeline to make those.  Because I'm a designer by training, which is good. And also bad because I can spend too much time polishing pixels.  Anyway, I tried. But so to answer your question, yeah, what I've noticed is my entire career was around drawing out things.  I did visual facilitation and worked in innovation consulting, this sort of thing. a lot of sense making kind of things.  And then I've. I noticed that that's where I get the most compliments, where I feel the best, where I feel competent.  And I was like, OK, I need to put this into an, I need to give a name to this thing, right?  And the funny thing is that I think framework designer, I think to me it feels a little bit pretentious perhaps.  But it gets a reaction. mean, people are like, me more about that. yeah, basically I try to convert people's expertise into pictures.  And I mix three things into that. One of them is that I'm interested in the topic of expertise itself, like expertise elicitation, types of expertise, you know, stuff that I've learned from research, seeing how people talk about what they do and seeing what they're thinking, but they're not saying this kind of thing.  I'm also being nerd for systems. I think systems are really interesting. And I have like index cards with systems.  things next to me and it's a real thing, it's sincere. And I like fun. I like jokes and puns and games and so I try to mix these three things.  And so this is a somewhat recent positioning, it's much better if I'm transparent. I've been doing this for longer, but I didn't call it that.  But I've helped some people figure out how to create some pictures that, you know, say something about how they work, why they work the way they work, factors that matter in their perspective, what happens if people don't use those things.  There's all these different lenses you can use, right? And it's funny I've mentioned like the big framework, because I think it's very common that people try to get to a big framework without the other ones.  Yeah, and it's really difficult. I try to stay away from it actually, because it's really difficult. it's like a Syrian song or Syrian song, right?  It really calls to you like, yeah, just figure it out and I think we'll fall into place. So this was a little bit of a monologue.  I'm sorry, did you answer the question?

5:13 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  I'm so, well, like, I'm so curious. Do you have like, I'd love to see some like examples. kind of like tried to like find your portfolio or I don't think I was very successful, but I'm so curious.  The reason I ask is because I, in my, I haven't found anybody that like does visual frameworks that I can like refer people to because I'm like, I can help, know, I can get people as far as like getting their knowledge, putting it in, but I'm like, I can't find anyone who's good at the design or at least that will take my call.

5:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a little bit like copyrighting for pictures, right? Yes. And yeah, I'm opening some examples to show you. And what I've noticed is that sometimes people assume that maybe a marketing agency, branding agency, but they're usually more on the aesthetics of things and less on the functioning of things.  So yeah, I don't think there's a lot of people with this label. I think there's a lot of people that can do this, but not a lot of them have this label.  So I'm just opening some examples.

6:23 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Yeah. mean, like, so one of my, like, yeah, like I've seen some people, like, I literally, like, I want someone to help drop.  Like I found an illustrator that helped me drew my frameworks as I went last year, which was great, but she's not doing that anymore.  And I'm like, well, I need someone who can, because I'm a very big fan. authority only works when you have a visual framework.  Like that's like, you have to know someone's A. You have to know their B. You have to know how to get from A to B.  have to showcase you have confidence. Your content has to be bucketed in a framework and everybody that. it, it looks like a  canva photo and I'm like, okay, well I like, I don't know who to send people to.  So that's why I like, I saw you as like, you do visual frameworks and I'm like, I need to talk to you because I want to, yeah, like I'm like, I have no, I want you to refer people to when they're like, I need to draw my framework.  I'm like, cool. have like, I don't know how to, I don't know who to send you to.

7:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. So double thank you for setting this up. I'll share my screen and I'll share some things. And this is a little bit embarrassing.  I think I have more visuals on this stuff, but it is what it is. Can I share? Yeah, I can share my entire screen.
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rGaDFxS3xezyimdwyBUqDt-FV7ip3JVU?timestamp=454.248488  yeah, you see my figma, I think. Okay. So this is some work I did with somebody and this is actually the end stage of this.

7:47 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Okay.

7:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We had like four sessions and they had structure. And we started by, I won't zoom in too much because there's some stuff from them.  Yeah, totally. But we went through two and things. One was about their own perspective, like how they look at the world, what's important to them, how they think about their own expertise, this kind of thing.  And the other one was much more about their process, so perspective and process, right. And this was a very creative person, was kind of the ideal client, really.  And we started, I have like this apple pencil, and we started drawing out things and figuring out what's like the best way of representing this sort of information.  Maybe I can zoom in on this one. So you'll see the final versions of this, but these are like three different ways of saying the same thing.  And the idea is that maybe different audiences connect with different layers of the visual, I'll show you the finalized ones.  So this was drafted during the session, and we're like, oh, how do you do And so on. Then I've made like this, I call them blueprints for frameworks because these ones are not pretty but they are very easy to brand afterwards, right?  So this one was a simple one to talk about their process and there's I mean nothing groundbreaking here, just five stages and as we move through there's aspects about how they qualify clients, it's important for their service, the way they qualify clients because it deals with health and then we started to deal with objections and questions people have around their own methods, right?  And this was an example of his work mixes science and art and we wanted to show what happens when you go too much into one side or the other, right?  Because I think this is one of the good things about visual frameworks, in the same image you can convey like different stages of what happens.  Right. If you go too much on this side, it's very clear. So this side here is more like specs to help them if they need to send it to someone else.  I won't show all of them, but I mean, some of them are more structured. Some of them are more like narrative.  Some, I mean, I list them here, but I don't call them really visual frameworks. It's just an output of the work we did.  For instance, these two, they are basically the same thing. It's about safety through support. And this one is more illustrative, and this one is more schematic, but they convey the same sort of thing.  And there's a logic to this, right? So the center thing is the objective. The quadrants are what you do with it, and the things in the middle of the ways to get to that thing.  So, yeah, this is perhaps most finished example of that and I have some other examples more drafty ones like let me share this I usually my screen yeah so the idea was that we we took it from I called it the visual framework engine still testing it as well we were starting from a core insights then figuring out what's the angle we want to you know used to to relate to that insight figure out what's the verbal we want to use and what's the the tone of it right yeah and then we came up with some things and I love this stuff maybe you know this stuff maybe you know Dave Gray oh yeah okay I don't so this is not mine I mean I might be shooting myself on the here but doesn't matter Dave Gray is really good so yeah you should check him out he talks a lot about visual thinking and  workshops it's kind of it's Dave Gray the visual frameworks guy uh yeah yeah i've used his um visual frameworks um site all the time yeah it's really good it's really good um i need a very approachable person so easy to to meet him so so yeah i think this shows you a little bit and maybe questions and stuff i could what's the structure of your like typical engagements like how like and you don't do the you don't do the pretty the pretty branding right like that's something you would kind of give that to a designer at some point yeah i prefer not to do it sometimes it sometimes i end up doing it but i don't really list it as a service got it i do it if i feel if if i feel the person is not um so comfortable with finding uh freelancers for this  Like people are really not at ease finding this stuff, so I'll just try to do something. But I tried to avoid it.  But so these things, this one was one session and the other one was four sessions, four sessions of 90 minutes.  And then I did work in between the last two sessions.

13:19 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Right.

13:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I've created those frameworks for those visuals. Yeah, and that was it. We did a final call to see if it was being useful and so on.  the funny thing was that he started using some of them, not all of them, just some of them in the work.  And he has repeat clients. So they were like, so now I knew this stuff because I've been through your problem before, but now you really get it.

13:53 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So it was a nice thing to get from him. Yeah. Do you, is it, you said the program that you meant?  at the four sessions or they went through his program when they like second option. Okay. And what's your general pricing range for like a 90 minute session for like a four, the four sessions, like kind of deep dive?

14:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So these four sessions, I choose a thousand dollars. Okay. The sessions and the design. Yep. So it's a package.  And that's it. I don't think I can do much in like just was a session. Usually I can use it for like a getting to know the person, but cool to service level.

14:36 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Awesome. That's helpful. Yeah. I'm just, I have I have clients who need they I'm like, I have no one to send them to help.  Like I have some clients, I'm like, we got to pull out your expertise and knowledge into a framework. And I'm like, I don't have anybody that I can send them to to help like, like mind mapping and pulling it all out and

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  kind of like putting it together. Yeah, love doing that. Thank you for thinking of me. Quick question, what would help you the most to refer?  I mean, let's assume for now just for the sake of argument that, OK, this is in the direction that you would like to see.  What could I do that would help you refer more easily?

15:26 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Well, part of it is on your website you have no examples, so that would be helpful. But yeah, I think that like and like it's funny, like I would like to see, you know, like it's really like you probably need to put your own framework on your site.

15:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I agree.

15:52 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  But yeah, no. Yeah, I, you know, and how you work, is it like in workshop setting? Is it? Yeah, I don't, yeah, just it would be helpful to that way.  I can be like, oh, yeah, this is and like what he does is like, he leaves you with like something that you can take to your designer to spec it out.

16:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

16:12 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  it. Like, you know, he doesn't feel like a, hold on, I wear ink design.

16:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's, that's, that's makes a lot of sense. I mean, fish doesn't fish don't know they're wet, right? And I forget that people are not familiar with like getting things to designer to finish them off.  yeah, yeah.

16:37 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So, um, I think it's like, I don't remember, like someone like was like, someone was like, like they nifty fox with someone, um, that they do creatives, like visually tell Tori, you know, they have like infographics and stuff like that.
  SCREEN SHARING: Jessica started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rGaDFxS3xezyimdwyBUqDt-FV7ip3JVU?timestamp=1018.306142  But like, you know, um, you're like, so nifty fox is kind of like. They have like infographics and they have animation and visual like visual summaries or project identities, but these are very like visual that's like it's like very design front versus what you're talking about is so, for example, I'm just going to pull up my.  Okay, I literally have a thing on methodology, like I have lesson on it in my teaching and like I have visual frameworks and then I have like methodology like pillars and process.  And so I'm like, here's your framework examples. Here's your pillar base. And then here's your like process based, but I didn't have anyone that could like, you know, I've like a lot of people are like terrible in Canada and like can't bucket it and things like that.  So literally, like I'm like. like it'd be great to be like, okay, like there's a, you know, someone if you're like, I want to do this, you know, here's, here's someone that can help for my private clients, kind of like bring it all together, because I'm like, I can kind of do it, but it probably, you know, I'm like, especially when it comes to these more comp, see, Dave Gray, there's more frameworks, like when it comes to the more complicated, it's like, how do you, the pros and cons of like picking the frameworks and things like that.  I, yeah, so that's just like, I have like, it's like, it's like, one of my core topics that I talk about in my work.

18:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's really good. Thank you. Because, yeah, also, I would imagine like, it's useful to compare the framework design with a visual facilitation, just give people a way of knowing what to expect on each thing.  Yeah, that's really useful. Thank you. Thank you for that. I really need to do that for sure. mean, it's solos and cobble to her son national shoes.  They're such a common pair combo. But anyway, I'm on it. I'm on it. Cool. I think I think I'll just put something together.  Do you have a, I mean, this is very low stakes, no expectations, but just helping you, helping me. Do have any specific like deadline that would be helpful for you?

19:33 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  No, just like, know, so for example, like, I just, I'm always looking for a good resource to like reference things.  But like, as an example, like, I have this blog post that's called how to be known as an expert in authority in your business.  like, I have like a process, how do you do what you do? It's like, I'll show you what it looks like.
  SCREEN SHARING: Jessica started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rGaDFxS3xezyimdwyBUqDt-FV7ip3JVU?timestamp=1200.715198  It's like, there's premise and positioning and persona and process. So like a documented artifact or written visual framework, like I could imagine if you had something that you're like, this is an interesting framework that consultants would use.  Like here's an example and I could link to your site just so that like people who come across this would know that like, what am I talking about when I say the visual framework?

20:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure, for sure.

20:27 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Absolutely.

20:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:30 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So, but also like I just like, like I don't have anybody that does this.

20:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's great. I have all the questions for you as well, besides this.

20:44 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Totally.

20:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Do you have other questions that maybe for now?

20:49 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  No, no, I just that's why I'm like, cool.

20:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to know how you do what you do. Yeah, yeah, no, this, this is great because end of the day here in Brazil.

21:01 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So I'm a little, a little bit slow.

21:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Me too. One of the things that I said on the message was that I like that, that blend, right?  Really strong business jobs and like the very warm layer to it, right, which is nice mix. And then I went into a little bit of a rabbit hole and you have so many podcast episodes.  And you wrote on every which was an amazing newsletter. Did you see what the guys did with every consulting just today or this week?

21:34 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  No, I did not.

21:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, it's they're brilliant. mean, basically, they've been playing around with AI for a while. Oh, yeah. So they just created AI consulting, right?

21:46 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Dude, yep. Yeah, remember every like, like, a month before they like decided to go all in on AI.

21:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You wrote out, okay, it's a yeah, I, I, I, I want have a one year subscription because one day I found like a Easter egg on their thing.

22:04 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Yeah.

22:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so many good things. Anyway, it's one of those mixed feelings like really admire and also a little bit jealous because they're so brilliant and cool.  But anyway, so this mix and also the way I've made notes, I've made notes, you mentioned something that also brings very true to me, which was like the forcing function of creating products is not just about the product, but also like you learning how you think about that thing, right?  And polishing, honing in like your thoughts and that. And that has been also something on my mind. Like for this quarter, I've decided to post like every weekday on LinkedIn.  And sometimes there's a slog and sometimes I start questioning like, oh, maybe I should just make some silly videos.  And it doesn't matter because you just sharpen that um that understanding it and so that that connected with me and yeah I feel I'm all over the place I'm just I'm sorry maybe I'm being a little bit of a fan boy um yeah what else can I tell you um yeah this I'm taking away the notes that makes it if you feel very real I think that's a thing and one of the things I was I was trying to do this year was to get into more conversations with people that have created products from their expertise right and maybe people that created decks of cards or people that have created games or workshop in a box this kind of things and I was like I think you have this sort of thing and I was like yeah I'd like to talk to you about that about how that went and I didn't know through all of your podcasts so maybe you have an episode where you touch on that and I can just do some  previous research before another conversation?

24:03 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  have never made, like, so it's so funny. did not, like, I've never made, like, a deck of cards. Maybe I need to make, like, a deck of cards, like, a Jessica Day insight.  But as you can see, business effects are clear.

24:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, my God. I always recommend the thing is, I have it, all the corners are folded and aligned.

24:28 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  like, you know, like, right, you know, but I'm, the way I think about it is I came to kind of, like, my framework after I'd been, like, publishing and writing and things like that.  I'd learned from someone early on that you needed a surface or methodology was, like, her, like, what she said, but, like, she didn't actually tell you how to do it, but I'm like, all right, well, I started out with, like, sole strategy system standability and that didn't, that was, I was in my, like, Uber feminist phase.  And now, you know, the more Like hotels in my own methodology is how I started to and I talked about it more and I wrote about it more how I like Refined my methodology as it were and now it's build it's design build run as like the three phases And design has three out a couple elements and build has six and run has a couple but I need to actually it's a funny I actually haven't Like when I'm like what I mean by run I'm like well, I think I mean these things Like this is my but I actually have to like do the work when I'm like I'm redoing my website over the next Six six eight weeks.  So like when I'm like saying design, I'm like it needs to have these like components to time Right, then my six systems.  Those are actually pretty solid and then like run. I'm like What do I think I mean when I say run because it's really like the rhythms and rituals of your business How do you choose and plan projects?  How do you manage your time? And then how do you um Track metrics so like that's actually like I need to codify  I spent over the last summer codifying my six systems of business building and now I need to codify the three to four systems of business running and I need to codify the systems of business design.  Business design kind of looks like architecting but that's like which like I have like a little cube that's like three different I'm like well it's versus crater it's solo versus scale so those are like the business design elements I have to like codify I'm writing a book which is helpful so like I'm first draft of the book is to my publisher so that that's really kind of helped but like really it's been through the it's been through kind of like the I have a hypothesis I'm gonna publish pieces on it that support that hypothesis until I'm like well now I think about it in a different way I don't know if that's helpful or not it's very helpful uh do you

27:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  do you know Teresa Torres? So she comes from the product management world and she has a book it's called Continuous Discovery I think.

27:14 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Oh yeah I've read that book I think.

27:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah and I think it's amazing the way she and this is a compliment she has really attached herself or attached the thing to herself the opportunity solution tree because you come from constantly you know that this was not invented now it was it's from before and she never claims she invented it right but it's really interesting how she finds ways of constantly and from different angles referring to that thing until people just associate opportunity opportunity solution trees Teresa right and I'm really interested in this like how do ideas become famous kind of thing and people become famous for their ideas and there's a guy I don't know if  We follow him and he writes, I'll send you a link. He writes case studies, exactly this. So I stopped doing that because he did really good ones.  And he did one on David Seabaker. So I'll send you the link. Can I send you the link via LinkedIn?  Maybe you can keep it easier. OK. So Liam, I think you'll enjoy his stuff. But so just to say that, I see some echoes of that in what you're telling me.  you have these ideas and now you need to put them in the collective consciousness. Like people think of them and think of you.  And I just find that fascinating. I think it's kind of the metagame of being an expert, I suppose, right?

28:58 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Yeah, it's really funny. Um, most people, like ever since I like, like there are, it's a there are like, some people are like, oh, I'm an expert.  I'm like, I'm gonna my crap. I'm like, you are not an expert until you can codify your expertise in a proven process and electrical property period.  You might be kind of an expert, but if like, it's custom and it's not codified and you can't prove it publicly, then you might be an expert, but note, but like the goal of marketing expertise is codified intellectual property.

29:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree. I agree. And it's very difficult as well. I agree. agree.

29:40 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  You haven't read this book. Another one. David Seabaker's counterpart Blair ends the four conversations as new as I didn't get it yet.  It's so good.

29:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I think I had it on saved on my wishlist. I never got through it.

29:57 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  But I'll do it.

29:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's the best.

30:00 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Because like he's like and you know this helps like that like the first conversation establishing yourself as an expert It's called the probative conversation and like this is where you're gonna be like You are seen as a vendor and until you have a proprietary process and expertise that someone can be convinced of before they get on the phone with you Mmm, I can see that.

30:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and really see that Yes, yes, yeah, I need to get it I just came home from Portugal and I usually come back with a lot of books on my suitcase.  So, yeah, got a little bit of a A little bit of a back Yeah, yeah, and Okay, so this is interesting and the money if I ask you like One of the things that I've been paying more attention to for the past maybe six months Well strength to step away from this thing like oh, here's the thing I know about let me tell  about the thing I know about, know, just, and I'm trying to shift into understanding more what's difficult for my clients and so on, like, what's challenging.  And I suppose you have a lot of insight into that, because you work with these people all the time.  is there any, like, subtle thing that most people don't realize that is a very common pain point, that you would be willing to share?  mean, this is the first time we're talking.

31:32 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Yeah, I mean, the two pain points that I see when it comes to, like, visual frameworks is, one, they don't know a lot, well, three.  One, they don't know why they need one, until they work with someone who, like, who, like,  get your framework.  Two, is they have so much knowledge that everyone's like, you need to have a framework. And I'm like, you need to have, like, 20 frameworks, right?  Yes. But everyone tries to start with, like, the big frame. Sometimes, like, I think you have an interesting insight of,  Sometimes you don't need the meta framework can come last like layers of frameworks. think actually is a Is an interesting like concept.  It's like instead of thinking about like the big kahuna Sometimes you just like start with like this framework and then see if it's missing something So like frameworks like iterative framework development.  Yes And then I think the third is um most frameworks that are like You know, there's this common like three then diagram intersection.

32:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

32:33 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  That's actually like In my perspective a very weak framework because it doesn't It doesn't show motion or progression. And so what I've actually like so how do you Pick a framework that connotates the next step Mm-hmm.  Just like documents that I have three buckets of expertise And so most people get frameworks wrong when they're just like, oh It's these things and I'm like, well, no  Like you want a framework that illustrates an entry point or a process or a phase or it needs to do, it needs to do something, not just like be three buckets of things.

33:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm. Yes. And I also think, yeah, no, we think so much alike in those terms. Actually, one of the posts I have drafted up is exactly about don't try to create the big framework, try to do the small ones.  And the thing you said, which is so subtle, and I love it, the iterative framework development.

33:30 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Because if you have a lot of small ones, you can test parts of the framework, right?

33:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right. Oh, people understand this bit, but they don't understand this bit.

33:36 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  So I'll just change this bit.

33:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. If you have like this massive thing of map of reality, you cannot, I love when you say that.  And also, I think there's an aspect that I think frameworks really sit between like marketing and expertise. So they must have a certain element of brand recognition or something.  Right. And the Venn diagram is really difficult to. send out and yeah everybody would it's the same thing a iteration I love a iteration but it's my three C's it's like yes but for that thing to become famous you need to put a lot of guys in that fire because it's difficult to to enter people's you know awareness.  So love the way you think about this.

34:22 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Show you two things one is I'm like very proud of one of my students so this is her methodology for like her center so she starts with like topics like inner work for outer change then relational stitching which is like how to eat relationships and then there's like imagining the world so like this is her like framework for like how change happens.
  SCREEN SHARING: Jessica started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rGaDFxS3xezyimdwyBUqDt-FV7ip3JVU?timestamp=2067.789866  It's a little complicated for me but at least she like got it down on paper and put it on her site.

34:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah it's it's also it's very coherent I haven't read every aspect but I can see how the middle layer is really stitching is a great  It's a great word.

35:03 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  But then I have a framework. This is like, it's four Cs. But because it's got a graphic, it's got a shape, it's got a momentum, this is my four stage of the mind journey.  it's alliterative. And here's another framework, how you go from the people in your network from warmest to coldest. So again, I'm just an illustrator.  But yeah, these are how I illustrate for my clients. Yeah, you might have four Cs. It's a circle. then I, yeah, so that's how I take my four Cs.  I'm like, y'all need people to recognize this. They're like, I want that diagram you have with the Cs. And it's circle and it's green.

35:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm like, that one. Yeah. Sorry, I shouted. But yeah, yeah. you need a couple of different anchor points for people to remember, right?  If it's just a circle, it's very difficult. If it's just a iteration, it's very difficult, but then you start stacking them up.  Oh, it's the green one because you have nothing that's perhaps purple, I don't know. And as we stack these anchors for recognition, I think it becomes easier.- That's a good phrase for you.

36:21 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Anchors for recognition, that's another point or like an interesting like anchors for like, you know, that's a powerful phrasing.

36:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

36:36 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  You're welcome.

36:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I think we see so many things alike, which for me is, I feel, I think it is a compliment because I like your stuff.  So it's interesting to see, it's very self-serving, I need to say this, but anyway. So yeah, I'd love to...  organize a little bit better, perhaps if you're open to it, when I put together maybe like a set of interviews, have a chat with you for a podcast episode or something, and the thing, I'll send your documents for you to think about it, but the thing that I'm most interested about is really this conversion in from like expertise to something, right?  doesn't have to be, when I said the deck of cards, it was just an example, but community, course, assessment, all of these things, frameworks.  So I sent some openness from you.

37:39 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Totally.

37:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

37:41 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Like, you know, let's stay in touch when you kind of, when you, as the cobblers say, put your shoes on.  Let me know so I can, you know, make intros or see if there's like further work that potentially can collaborate on.

37:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect, yeah, but I mean... It was great just meeting you and seeing. I'll send you also a draft for something I've written.  No homework is just maybe you'll find it interesting.

38:08 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  I appreciate that. Are you on my newsletter?

38:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I am, but I'm not sure.

38:15 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Maybe I should check again. You'll get a calendar thing to say, join my newsletter, but you should join my newsletter.

38:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, let's see. Because I think it's. Oh, maybe not. This is a different design from what I had in mind.  Yeah, I'll do it. You'll see my confirmation.

38:37 - Jessica Lackey (Jessica Lackey)
  Sounds good. All right, well, enjoy your day. was fun and we'll be in. Likewise. Thank you. Have a nice one.  Ciao.
