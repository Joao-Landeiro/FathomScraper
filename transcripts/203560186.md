0:00 - Mau
  as well made on the dynamic but I felt like from the last thing we had, I think you want to speed up things and enjoy and take advantage of any moments that we have right now.  So I think it's a way for us to talk about today is see what we have planned last week and then check what else do you think we should put in an advance?  and then from that we we we decide how to work on that so it's going to be on demand or if you have a couple of hours each month or so we can decide we are flexible to work with you so you also can say this is best way of working for me so yeah no I think it would be good yeah because I feel like to have a plan moving

1:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  forward and then at the same time I spent some time on the plane yesterday and this morning just reorganizing the whole environmental side because we have a lot of content on the on the g side but not the e side so I feel like I have control of it now so I could also show that to you and explain because that will also help with the design process because it did throw you guys a lot of documents beforehand and I can show you kind of how they fit into our system two so I could spend some time today doing that before I hand it over to you guys so you can see how everything kind of fits together so I think that was kind of missing but I was it I was able to do that yesterday and I prepared it yeah before for the meeting today so we can talk about it so that could help so I don't know is better that I show you that first or do you want to show me what you prepared first I'm flexible what do you think all right what we have right now is what we have planned last week so is the the mirrored board as well so we wanted to hear from you so maybe you can start okay  let me share okay so this is the Cognite Cognite is the like kind of the unicorn Norwegian unicorn that we want that oh can you hear me I can hear but I don't see anything I do I do yeah yeah yeah do you see the folder okay then just let's go back yeah okay yeah yeah do you see it yeah okay so this is Cognite I started preparing the documents for them because the goal is like over this break is that have all the clean documents and then the beginning of January send it to them to review and ideally we would be generating this in our tool and everything would be placed in our tool but we're gonna have to do a few things offline while we're getting our  already. So if you if you see here you can see risk assessment policy. I stacked it in terms of what the way the compliance map is set up within our system, right?  So then I kind of break it down each one and then I gotta and these document names need to change because they're all over the place and I've kind of cut out documentation.  I've like said like we don't need to do this or like these are the things that we need and then the ones that say design are the ones that we need to have designed and some of them we just need to create.  So like risk assessment here and I like there's a new risk assessment process that has been created. I wonder if you're probably not going to see my screen if I do it but I can show it to you after that.  So each one so then same with policies and procedures and trainings. I have here is like these are standard standard procedures that need to be in our tool like for for launch and I've been working on that but these don't really need to be designed.  These are more just texts that I've been creating. same with management review and then training. I'm updating the training documentation for that, but you guys don't need to do that.  All the ones that meant design are going to be the ones that you guys need to design. Then controls, so then there's controls, which is like carbon footprint of the cloud.  It's like a process. You guys have kind of, oh, no, and then employee feedback lease card. So you guys have kind of done this one.  This is the one that Romeo had done before, or in terms of the copying of the Zanetta one, here is, so actually, let me go back all the way to the beginning.  So I have built this risk assessment based off of a digital cloud company. So if you think about like Cognite or some of our very fast-growing series, series A, D unicorn, they're all digital companies so they don't have heavy assets, right?  So, what can you do in terms of environmental management systems or a company that is not mining coal or something, right?  So, then you say, okay, for the risk assessment, you need to look at your legal risk, you need to look at different environmental aspects risk for your sector, and then you need to talk to different stakeholders.  So, these are all the documentation on that. And then around the policies, we have like standard documents as required by the ISO.  So, this is like, how do you manage your documentation? This is the policy for how you manage procurement within risk assessment.  Since we're the energy management that you would have to do. And then, yeah, all of the different policies required for the ISO in relations to your environmental management system.  Sorry.

5:40 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, of them have designed inside of parentheses on the circle. Yeah. What is that?

5:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

5:50 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So design means that we need those designed like so a lot of the designed ones are.

5:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The designed ones are and I'll open them for you afterwards. This is once I open. you won't see it.  So these are like more like forms, like so it's like you need to design like where do they put in the environmental aspects or like there.  And then these are mainly policies here and like a training. And then you go back to the controls. So what I figured out is like if you look at a digital company, what is our environmental impact, right?  What do you even track? So what you see is offices like for scope one and two emissions, it's like lease cars, electricity, waste and then recycling of your IT equipment, like old computers.  Like that's what you can do in the office. And then there's another big one is around our data center usage.

6:38 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like how much do we use on the cloud?

6:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's actually a big usage on that. like you know Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all of our data stored on the cloud, that's actually a big energy usage one.  then and then like and then for the controls, this could be an employee portal, there needs to be employees need to be able to put in a request like a document request change reform as part of the  So they need to if they want to put in an incident report and then, you know, employees suggestion for improvement.  So these are all things that need to be designed. These are like more forms that they need to submit, you know, to be able to capture the information within within the stakeholders.

7:15 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then same with stakeholders, like we have to update the procurement process to manage the standard procedure, which I'm working on there.

7:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then for audit, have like, you have to, you have to have almost two sections that we're probably going to have to sit with Joe and like kind of break down.  How does this actually look before we can draw it out? But there's one section called document retention that you need to show the documents that you have and then one for internal audit, in terms where you need to go in and have internal audit forms and like, and follow up.  And then you have and then you have management review and then you have employee portal, which I've updated now within that.  But do you want to go and then I can open some of the documents and show it to you?  Yeah.

7:56 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Why some of them are in an Excel format?

8:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, it's just that at some are in Excel because they're just straight up forms and checklists, but others are just within word.  It's not really a good reason why. I'd hire a consultant to kind of create these initial documents like an ISO specialist.

8:16 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then what he did was create like 50 million documents, which are just way too much for like a digital company.

8:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I've been slowly paring it down and trying to reorganize them. He had also organized them through the ISO methodology.  So we're trying to put the ISO methodology into our methodology. so that's what I've been kind of doing is like, what do we not need?

8:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What can we cut out? how do you make it for a digital company?

8:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So that's kind of what I've been doing. But it's yeah. So then let me just show let me share you some of the documents here.  So if you see my screen, for example.

8:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like I saw risk assessment process here, like I've been throwing into chat to be tea, right?

8:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like that's. Like, there's like three main points that you need to do. And I think this might be a section with the Zhao, is aspects and impacts, interested parties, and legal register, which is the third one.  There's three kind of steps that you need to do in the risk assessment. And each of these have three steps.  Like, you have to do review from trusted resources, you need to identify your risks, you need to track information there.

9:25 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And so I've kind of broken it down there, but I think that can be another time we sit down and discuss that.

9:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then so if you think about like legal register, I think I sent you this one already, but it's like an example of, you know, as part of that process, it is gonna be like, feel like ideally it's gonna be like AI generated that says, these are your risks, but then it'd be more like firm, these are the relevant risks that are there for you, you know, that's there.  So this needs to be kind of dragged in like a design so that they can, it's pre-filled, but then they can add new ones in there.  And then same with like, environmental aspects like it's really not like the most exciting design but like these are kind of like the manual processes that people use that instead should just be digitalized you know what I mean so these are some of the forms that that they have and then same with like stakeholder analysis but I have examples of these each of these in the kind of the the design process there so yeah so there's not as many in the policies procedure training is more in the controls so then like data center carbon I put I put an email that I sent to one of the Cognite people saying like how to actually access the Amazon Azure Microsoft and Google cloud like there's also free ways to be able to calculate the sustainability based on their workloads to sell so we have to somehow design this into the tool and then also capture the information either manually like you know every quarter put in the information so you can track it there ideally we'll find it  API if we can figure out how to connect with these, you know, but in the meantime there should be a design for that.  And then there's a requirement with an ISO that employees are allowed to review the documentation and then send an email or send a message being like, I don't agree with this policy, I need you to change the documentation.

11:19 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So there needs to be like a documentation request form. So these are some of the forms that the employee feedback and review needs to give.  So this can technically be, these three can also be in the employee portal, which actually I didn't, if we wanted we could move that control into the employee portal.

11:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I was thinking that there still needs to be within the controls, like the compliance manager reviewing it and reviewing the answers.  So whether or not that's in the task management process there. But yes, like recycling of IT, you know, this is really, it's nothing, right?  It's just more like how people do it manually, but we could just build it into our tool where people can fill it in a tool and then it kind of generates information.  But it's not a lot. Now continue to work on these documents, but it's just kind of a breakdown of where all of these fit.  So if you think about another design, you know, like the audit checklist, like you know, these need to be put in so that when somebody wants to do an audit, then they can, like all of this may be in there and then people ideally check it off or something like that in there to make sure it's done.  it's more, doesn't have to look exactly the same, but it's kind of capturing some of that information. And then like minutes forms, like you have minutes for the management review minutes because you're going to have to be able to show evidence of these reviews.

12:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So that's kind of how it works.

12:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So there's not as many as I think when I handed you guys a lot, I've narrowed some of them down, but it's still like one, two, three, four.  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then, and then 11. then so I updated the integrity hub to, you know, all that text that kind of shows all the controls that people are doing in the integrity hub.  I could see, I was trying to, like Santa has all of these controls here, right? I think you guys had it in your thing, right?

13:28 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So this is kind of like security or organizational security.

13:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So now we have like, you know, these are the controls here, like risk management policies and procedures training. And so you have a lot more detail now because this matches all of the documentation that I kind of simplified up there.  So we can update the employee portal to kind of match this text because when we have that, then also makes the company look better because it shows all of the stuff that they're doing as part of this EMS process.

14:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, good. Thank you for the overview. One of the things that you've mentioned something in passing here that I think was caught my attention, which is, I don't remember exactly the words, but it was something on the lines of it doesn't have to look exactly like this.  Because when I look at these documents like the certification documents to me, they are mostly, you know, just just a glorified checklist in a sense, right?  They are almost like that. So, what I'm thinking is the the certification process is also usually for scales for reasons of scale kind of going through the right?  what I was thinking is if we have a good separation between the content of the checklist and the way it looks.  I think it makes it really, and what you showed us helps us with this, makes it easier to adapt to new regulations and new demands, right?  So if I understood it correctly, the things you were showing us were basically kind of two main categories. Policies, which are kind of a description of a process, and forms and checklists, which are a little bit more interactive, like one is more descriptive and the other one is more interactive, maybe.  maybe something that we can do to be able to move fast is like the first horizon of translating all of these policies and checklists into our own tool.  It's probably just useful to just have a way of people uploading these field documents. even if they don't look so great, just uploading all of them to Fortify and have a single source of truth, like they know is not lost in some mail or someone.  And maybe a second layer is making it exciting, so we convert this weird Word documents into a Fortify experience with the design and so on.  And the third layer is making it smart, right? Then we put AI on it and just say, oh, the way you answer this thing probably means that people would like to answer this thing.  To me, this is helpful to figure out where to focus on next. I don't know if I'm making too much sense now, how do you feel about this?

16:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think the more integrated we can have it in the tool, so it's not just upload. Even if it's ugly forms in the meantime, because I'm also a little bit worried about people stealing our thing, all this material that I have, you can just take it and download it in our system, and then they can go and create their own or do it offline.  So if it's in a form, it at least makes it a little bit harder to steal because they have to go through so many forms and collect information.  What I was happy about when you looked at this process that's about environment, you think about G, G is a lot more complex than E is what I'm realizing, right?  Because if you think about just the employee portal in E, there's conflict of interest expenses, government officials, all of these different ones.  In here, it's like, I think it's three, know, document change request forms, you know, we're going to put like maybe an incident management one and then optional employee improvement recommendation.  That's all we need from employees for this one. So the controls are a lot smaller in this one. And then, and then the policies, not everybody needs to review all of the policies.  It's only like a store management like thing for it. So it ends up like ends up being more of a workflow tool that for for the ESG lead, as I call it, know, they need to go in and check their carbon footprint X amount of time.  They need to do the training so there's not like they need to check their recycled assets, you know and see if they have a process for that.  So it's not as it's not as heavy what I'm realizing, especially for digital companies here. So it's more just so we need to update the process to make it match it and how it looks.  So I think that that's a good thing. I think at least for e to kind of get it out up and running.

18:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Now they kind of figured out what the core environmental impacts are.

18:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you got it. Makes sense.

18:42 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  First is one of, okay. So I understood. I understood your point that it's, it's just to just make the forms into the tools so people cannot skill it and we have a more integrated experience.  That kind of thing like connecting with. an API to figure out server costs and stuff like that. Is this for now or do you see that as a more?  No, I think it's a no, that's in the future.

19:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think what we need is like a form where they can like collect the information, you know, this is our cloud usage on AWS, Google that and then just they manually get a reminder to put it in twice a year and then you kind of track it over time.  I think that's first and then if that's easy to get to then and it could be directions, know, here's here's where it could be like for Google.  Here's the directions on how to do it. And then here's here's here's here's a form for you to put in the number in and attach evidence, you know, or something like like that.  That's all we probably need in the short term in there. Got it.

19:54 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So the next the next step would be to make one float. Is this Mauricio? Is this the thing we discussed?  Like make one flow as an example, one form as an example?

20:09 - Mau
  Yeah, this is part of what we discussed last week. So as so Abby is going to revise everything that she sent last week.  So we decided to make one design of it to see how it looks. Yeah, that's what we planned last week.  This is the first task, but now do we have everything more structured? Can you know review what we're going to do?  Well, I think like, you know, part of like even like, I think one is like kind of the structure.

20:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Step one, do this, step two, that's the step three.

20:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But like I think in this period, because now you're also traveling, right?

20:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  at one point, part of step one, two or three is going to be these like boring forms that they need to fill in.  And that's the tedious stuff to try to figure out. Okay, how to make this info collect this information, but like make it look nice, like what nice, nice.  this, right? And then the text stuff can be filled in before after. And that's what I was thinking of like, okay, we have these forms that need to be created, it's going to take some like, detailed manual, like, okay, how can this look?  But I don't know how easy it is for you guys to either just take the form as is with all this like text and just try to fix it up, or do you need to know what's one and step three are before you can make, know, step two, the form.  Because then you need gel to kind of go in and like see how things fits. But like, since you're going to be traveling, like maybe it's just okay to just do step two, like draw out that out so that when a gel is back, then we can go okay, now let's go to step one and three and then we already have that done, right?  We're not waiting to get these forms because we know we need to collect this information. Anyway, I think that was kind of my thinking is like, okay, let's just drop these forms into Figma.  It's good. Then the development team can maybe also just, you know, pick it up because that's more than development side versus just text being like, you need to do ABC, you know, there.  So that was just some of the thinking. But there are, you know, other things I think we had talked about like on the list even before, you know, this part.  But this is what I'm trying to figure out how best to manage because ideally by the end of January we have at least most of the design work for E-ready.  I don't know if that's possible, looking at it, it doesn't look out of control because if you think about this, which is a big bulk of it, this is pretty much done policies, procedures, training, communication, because that is already done for G.  All we need to do is update the policies in there, right? So you guys don't really know anything. So that's a big bulk of the tool that is already done for E.  This part probably needs to be set up with that, with the process, but it's still very similar like step one, two, three.  It's like three big processes with three steps each, right? So it's not so complex and it kind of matches the similar process that we already have and I'll draw it out.  And then we have like three main controls around like data. turn around offices, we've already done with like, we just probably need to optimize the one that Romeo did.  And then this one, the procurement process is very similar to the process that we're already doing right now. So and then these two audit, an internal audit and review, we haven't really made any one.  So we need to draw out how that's going to look. these are, but these are a lot of templates too that are there.  So yeah, so that's the question is like, how do we get as much ready in January timeframe? So it's like, you know, we can actually make like some of these designs of these, you know, in the first two weeks, that can be when I was traveling, and then like, you know, do more when he needs back for the rest of it, that could also be a possibility too.  But that's what I'm trying to figure out. And then we also had some stuff that we talked about before I got all the documentation and was reviewing it too, like, you know, report, like on the list.  It was so, it's a warm, yeah, not a dead.

24:04 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  yeah, so to answer your question, does it make a difference if we start creating designs before we have the full flow?  I mean, yeah, it should have some sort of an impact, it's probably good enough. We can probably do that.  We can probably, you know, work on the design, even if we don't have the full process.

24:32 - Mau
  that seems doable.

24:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Within that approach, probably what would be the most helpful, and we're going to figure this out, it's what they call like a vertical slice, which is like one aspect of the journey end to end.  So we know the call it a vertical slice in video games. When you're presenting a new video game, you don't make a full video game.  Just like a level work.

25:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  people can do anything.

25:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So it's kind of of like that idea. So something that it feels that it could be useful and also not not a risk of wasting too much time or effort would be like to pick one of these and convert that into the form within the 45 something in that direction.

25:22 - Mau
  How do you this?

25:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

25:26 - Mau
  I think in a way of moving forward, I think we can start with that. And I don't see necessarily that you're going to have any big impact or something changes.  as we are still on the Figma file, so I think everything is possible. But you know, I understand that we need to make things move forward and fast.  So yeah, we can do that. We are able to do it to the next two next two weeks.

26:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like, like, with you, like, I don't know, like, yeah, because I know I was traveling. like, and if I just sit with you, kind of map out the process, you know, step one, like to like, and then can draw it out too.

26:12 - Mau
  I think that's, that's fine.

26:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But it's yeah, more about that aspect, and how do we move quickly? So we have like the I think the goal should be that we have like the big bulk of the design done for environmental, which I think is possible.  Because if you think about like, eggs and the work that eggs did, like, you know, we're just one and a half people, they did a lot within like a one and a half months or two months with like, G, which is a lot more complex and starting scratch right now, we're just using E and we already have the workflow that they're doing, you know, and we have some of the information done that I'm hoping like, that should be a go by the end of January that we have at least the e design, like, you know, most of it done, I would say, in that and whether or not like, like, and what, what is it going to take, you know, in terms of like availability for you guys, because also Pinara was working like  lot for that intense period too. And that's what I also want to check with you guys too for that and see and then you know at one point like I don't know if you're like you're in Portugal until February right like I don't know if you have time to like maybe we could fly you over to Oslo just for a day or two also and like just pound some of these out if that's going to help if you're available but I'm just trying to think like how do we get we need to get this part done in January because we need to start testing it.  Yeah so I'll leave for Brazil on the 6th of February.

27:37 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think I agree with you on the so basically I agree with you that this is probably not from the development perspective is not as much work as it probably could seem to be because they have a lot of components that are ready and I think converting these forms into a more attractive design.  and it's a lot about what's our definition for this version of attractive design, right? So, because we will keep on developing the platform throughout, you know, for a while, this will be the least exciting version ever.  By definition, the next one will be better than this one. And if we have like clear boundaries on how far do we want to turn that knob into the excitement, it becomes easier to say, okay, this is good enough for now, right?  And because the stage where we are in right now, which is we need to have these things into the E and the pilots are very motivated to do it, and they'll probably more open to, you know, not a Disneyland of a form.  And I think we could, by having that these vertical slides of one form that we say these are we think this could be the V1, I think  it becomes really easy to just translate that into the different forms because forms are made of the same primitive, right?  There's a question, multiple answer. That is actually, yeah. Yeah, it's always the same sort of thing. If you solve like the five most common kinds of structures, we'll have everything.  Yeah, and we have some forms already developed, right?

29:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So even if existing designs of the forms have just changed it. So for me, I think you'll be happy to know I started reading Lean startup on the way here and they're talking about how bad the MVPs are, the first iteration and that like that.  it's kind of set like, think for me, it's like, it's fine. I think as long as we're able to get a tool that's working that can suck in information that can't be stolen very easily and that shows it works, then I think that it's good.  Okay. Yeah.

30:03 - Mau
  I think it's fine.

30:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  doesn't need to be beautiful, but I think it just needs to be able to work and function in the first iteration of gathering information and having a walkthrough of what we need.  I think that's fine. then we can tailor it, use AI future-wise, but it's more like, what is that basic?  For me right now, I just want something that works.

30:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It doesn't need to be beautiful.

30:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I do think the employee portal could be like some parts of at least like that when you go in and that that's kind of nice and like check off the policies because I'm not even sure if we have the flow for like confirm like, you know, the policy that one is good, but like I don't expect any employee to put it in the document change management request like they're never really gonna go click.

30:42 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I don't care if that's pretty or not, you know, like that doesn't really matter, but for some of the things that they need to do then that would be better to have.

30:49 - Mau
  Yeah.

  Yeah. So today we have shown us with a little bit more detail on the documents.

30:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We've discussed the value of creating the vertical slides so just taking one of them and converting it to a form and we've also agreed that of course it needs to be interesting and exciting but we understand that it doesn't need to be like the dual window of the forms for this first version and maybe we could just I don't know if this is for this conversation right now or if it's for a later conversation deciding which form would be the most helpful to convert into the design well like how much like when you say like like one form like you know we have like 10 forms that need to be done like and we're going into like a two-week period when you're traveling so we have like 14 days right like that like I'm hoping that like you know within these 14 days these 11 forms can be made just even if it's the form itself right like it doesn't need to have the flow like I think it's like I feel like that's what takes time is like kind of the tedious like like forms I could be wrong but like my point is that

32:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like some of that can be done or maybe like now we can just meet like and then like and try to like bust these some of these things out on Figma to keep things moving.  It is I don't want things to stop when Jao's on holidays like like we should be still synthesized information without him right like you know so like we can still continue moving forward on this and I think that's what I want to make sure that we have um there uh so that over the next two weeks like or three weeks what can we get done the most in this period yeah.

32:32 - Mau
  I think we uh my suggestion here that Joao and myself we're gonna talk and see everything that I have to do and we can you know measure how much effort we're gonna have in these two weeks and then make a plan for you.  Yeah, I think you presented everything so yeah I think I think we need to talk because we have a lot to to work on and then prioritize and then how are you going to start that and then make a plan for the next two weeks or three weeks actually.

33:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and like, however, I don't know how Romeo, how free he is or or that, but, but I can take you a screenshot of kind of these this breakdown and then that I showed you so you can you can see.  yeah, yeah, I think it's yeah. Yeah, and I think at one point, it's like, we keep planning. keep planning and we just kind of need to do it.  Right. So it's like, that's what I'm trying to figure out when like getting like getting it.

33:34 - Mau
  Just down on to paper on, on, on to figma, like a few, a few versions that we can discuss.  So I think that's what I'm trying to figure out.

33:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'll just send it right now. Yeah, I'll send it here.

33:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I sent it on email now. So you can see kind of, it's just the screenshot of those documents that you can see, but you have gotten some of those documents already like.

34:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  email right so it's just more of those are not placed in like kind of where they would fit within the flow of our our documentation but I am free like I can even meet a little bit earlier I'm in California so over the next few weeks I'm happy to meet just also get this done and if it can be like okay like just like a more detailed plan by the first day we'll have this form by the second day we'll have this form like yeah it's like what will be produced and what do you need in between because I'm happy to be available make sure that I'm in the time period like I can meet like an hour or two before this time too and just sit down there yeah anything yeah but but could you send the files you sent the screenshot right yeah I sent the screenshot I can send the the the file I sent before but now I'll put in I renamed them so I can put the files in there now I'll put the ones that say design on it so then here I'll just do that now yeah I'm okay with that so we have all the files  For some of them, I think, let me just put some of there. OK, I was just doing it right now.

35:15 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, because the first thing that we are going to do is just to start going in depth on every one of these documents, because last week I have just a brief look.

35:28 - Mau
  And then we went through some of them. yeah, now they have everything structured and all the documents so we can make a plan on this structure.

35:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK, great. see what we need to do, and then we make a plan.

35:40 - Mau
  this is going to be happening, you know, we want two days because we need to see how long are those forms.  And, you know, in terms of information, interaction and how we can keep them. yeah.

35:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I'm happy that I think at this point it's like when you do. I think about when Zhao was saying AI integration was basic, like go on the basic, like what is the fastest to implement because that's going to be like, like what is the simplest even if it's ugly for the first time, but like the fact that they can't feel it and they can use it, like that's what we want.  And you can look at our previous versions on what you did. So don't make it too fancy, just more like just have it on a Figma design because the developers needed something on Figma to be able to go right.  And I can't make the Figma and this is where you guys can be good in terms of at least making it nicer than anything that we can do, but fast and quick and easy to be able to gather this information.  I think it's a good starting point. then we can have a discussion later on being like, okay, now we want to fancier because this is actually a little bit too much, but like start at the basic level.  I would say speed and execution is more important right now to make sure that we can get them launched.  Because we also want to test with some of these smaller companies in January too. So, but we can test policy procedures and trainings with them.  So we have a little bit of time for the controls and the other aspects of it, but that's kind of what we're looking at.
