  Sorry, I had my fathom join in, but if you want, we can just remove it. It comes automatically. No, it's fine.

0:07 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  It's for the people waiting as well, but I already thought it was your AI help. So I'm off. I was also testing a few ones, but I haven't found one that it doesn't touch quite well.  Oh, yeah, yeah.

0:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's the same. I do it with you. Yeah, when I do it in Portuguese, it also gets confused. It's funny.  What's Fathom and English is fun? Yeah, so far. Have you tried it?

0:42 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  No, there's one more.

0:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's so many of them. Just to be sure, we are waiting on someone or you thought that the thing waiting was the fat.

0:56 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yeah, the last one.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  latter one. No problem.

1:01 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  No, so we're good to go. I'm good to go. Good to go.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Well, thank you for being up for this. Just nice to connect with you on LinkedIn. And it's fine because I've been connecting with a lot of Dutch people around this productized consulting thing.  It used to be British people for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe it's the algorithm just seeing me talking to British people.  Then in the last like three weeks or so, more Dutch people have been popping up in my network. So it's interesting.  It's our time. I mean, the time zone.

1:39 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  No, as in, now it's time for the Dutch people to release one.

1:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now, now it's in your season. So anyway, thank you. Thank you very much. And basically for this, I just want to, you know, get a lot of as much information from you as I can in terms of like your.  context. not trying to sell you anything or I might show you something to get your feedback, but it's really, this is not like a sneaky way of getting you to buy something.  I'm doing customer discovery and so I think I approached you.

2:15 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  So I got message from you, but I think it was an automated one because I've learned it on your profile.  I think correct or not?

2:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't have automated messages. I think that's you with you.

2:29 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yeah, I think so.

2:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I sent a post on workshops in the latter, the Product Innovation Ladder. I think you liked it or you added me and then I went ahead and sent you a message.  So I interacted with it.

2:44 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  So I was just, yeah, some of the things that I maybe read in your post, but also that I was on your website.  they really, yeah, they, they, It's the right spot or something, so yeah, oh, that's nice. mean, so I'm not too worried that you try to sell something, but I'm really interested in the things that you work on because I think that this is something that we struggle to do, but that's I think can be of great value for us.  Let's just discuss it and we'll see if you can. Good, good.

3:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for being so open about it. So if you remember, maybe not the specifics with like the vibe that you got that was like, oh, this is interesting.  Do you remember the sort of thing that made you go that way?

3:53 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Sorry, you mean for myself?

3:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you saw my post on my website, something about it was like Ah, I'm curious about this. I don't expect you to remember the specifics, but is there anything that stood in your mind that was like, there's something in this?

4:11 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  It's about, so I don't see myself as a consultant. I don't think I am a consultant, although I think I have to realize that I'm perceived as consultant.  What I think I am is a founder who operates and I found out years ago that I'm on the spot of the Louisville Hall.  don't know if you know I'm very famous Dutch football trainer, so he plays soccer himself once, so he was played to play football, but he wasn't the best football in the world.  But he knows how it is to be played as a soccer player and but he's the best trainer. What a once, but in my  I think you have to have played soccer yourself, some exceptions there, but you have to have done it in order to be able to know what it's like to coach them as well.  So I think there's also go for founders. You cannot advise founders if you have never ever done it. It's all textbook wisdom and it's not said that it's in helpful, but you can't operate the same way as a founder does.  But I found out that I'm better at operating together or for other founders better than I am in creating my own company or building it to a unique one.  I've never succeeded in that, but I got really great at starting. And you can start, so there's only some little time to start your own company, so I started  what me and the person that I'm starting it now, what we face is that so we find it quite hard.  Only one end is quite simple to tell people what we do and we also find it that other people find it quite complex and else but what is dedicated and we quite well know what we do.  But there's someone else who I really love from and who talks about the zero to one yeah sort of products and so there's complexity here and there's nothing here and how yeah what can you come up with that are sort of and I think you sort of said sort of same things you talk about bytes I think or size by things but at least sort of manageable things that people can say yes to the address.  that they have and that they can way more easily say yes to and in the past year one and a half year I've sort of tried and tested a few things and it was sort of random and they were to people and people paid for it but I never managed to sort of get build product out of that and not so much it should be stand long product but has a sort of very fast intro entrance to things that we finally do but you need to have something else in order to say yes to the other thing yeah totally I I've had this conversation with a few people right and there's it's so funny because you see some of the expressions and the mine mental models right zero to one is the thing that pops up in conversations with other

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think founders and principles that are in the situation that I think that you are, like they know a lot and they have this comfort in being in the undefined zone and getting out of the undefined zone, which is uncommon, we get used to it, but most people are not used to navigate that, right?  But you are actually the first person that tells me that it's easy for you guys to tell what you do.  Most people that I've been talking to say that they struggle with that. So I think it doesn't sign off, like you've been doing this for a while.  you have this thing, you know?

8:34 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yeah, but it's a bit of both. So I think I said, on one hand, I can explain what I do very easily.  And on the other hand, it's all sort of complex because it's, yeah, because it's so, it is sort of new and undefined territory.  Yeah, yeah.

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this facility or this ability some people have with, know, just being curious and like, okay, I'll hear this for a few more minutes to see where you're getting, not everybody has that.  So some prospects are like, you lose them really fast. I mean, that has been my experience whenever I talk to very, very pragmatic people.  If I don't get to like the deliverables or like outcomes that they're not interested in the theory or anything like that.  Very good. So you told me what is easy about your business. Do you have other things that are easy about your business?

9:49 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  So it's quite easy to spot the startups that need our help. of the most. So one of the things that we are working on very hard of sales is how to find our early adopters.  we work with them on some most studies that we have worked with and worked with. So one of the main problems that they have for this, so I think that what the most challenging thing is that we, I think you mentioned it, so we work sort of in the territory of unknown unknowns.  So we work on things that they don't know, that they don't know. So how do you sort of convince someone that this is a problem.  So but I want to most times turn around. So if I need to convince them, then they are not my audience, then they are the laggards for me.  So I need to find the founders that have known unknowns, that know, that they don't know stuff, but they don't know exactly what they don't know.  But what they do know is that that they spend way too much on paid advertising, that the traffic is whimsical.  And so this day it's up, next day is down, and they don't know why. They have long lead times, indeed, to be, for instance.  have high acquisition costs, but very different user feedback. Person A says this, person B says that, person C says that.  It's also, for me, these are all signs that they, so one of the most important things that they do not do is customer segmentation.

11:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's one, so they don't segment.

11:41 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  But within segments, they don't also, and most of them aren't really familiar with it, with the concept of early adopters.  So who are the ones that I need to target first? if you, so this is your audience, so segmenting your audience already sort of slims it down to this, and slimming it down to you early adopters.  And then you have a group of people, at least what you think, that you can work with. But if you don't do that, then everybody comes in and this is where all pros that they face, they arise, most of them arise from this.  And because they say, I've talked to customers, A, someone becomes a customer and you start paying to you. Before that, it's not a customer, it's someone out there who you think you're trying to get a job done.  It might be semantics, but I think it's really important. And then they say, I talk to these people and most of the time when I look at the questions that they asked, they're the wrong questions, they all have the answers, but also they, they, for instance, people who like coffee and that was the audience and they have to ask everyone who likes coffee.  But if you. some of all these things, then it's not a surprise that you end up with a lot of blur because a lot of different people, wrong questions, and yeah, it's a -up.  Exactly, but they still think, so if they read books, they think, ah, but talk to customers, and they think according to the book that all things write, and it's very important, and this is sort of the point that we try to talk to people, is that they feel that they're out of options, they've tried lot of things, they hire agencies, know, they're advertising, you've talked to a lot of customers, and still flat lines.  That's the point that they sort of become exhausted, and they don't know anymore, and this is the point where we still know a lot.  So we are looking for these founders, so the ones that have known unknowns that know that they don't know a lot of things, but they don't know what they don't know.  So this is for us, because my experiences, if I talk to fans that think they still have options or they think that they know it all, those are the ones that I don't need to convince because they don't think they have a problem.  Yeah, yeah.

14:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They might come back but it will take them a while and a bit.

14:20 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yeah, they might come back. I always try to leave something there that I sort of in a year, I can say or I can ask them how then you said this, how are you doing now?  Yeah. With the times I checked it again, it went very different than they expected and often it's it's also because of the reason that I thought at that moment.  But it's not to say I told you so, but it is to sort of the validation is there. I we discussed these things, you still thought you had options.  Now we hear all the options didn't work and maybe now it's time to get to the real work, but it's

15:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it seems to me that you have a very, and you talk about these things, I'm even getting a little bit self-conscious because I think you do this thing on the other side very often.  So I don't do it. That's what you are for. But the thing is, what kind of signs do you look for, like you have a picture of who these guys are.  I'll do you from the outside identify these people and like, oh, this guy is probably ripe for this conversation.

15:40 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yeah, so this is still one of the things that we don't know yet exactly. So this is why I also think that inbound is, so we talk about  about posting on LinkedIn. For instance, we started doing this on a regular base. I did it a few times in the past, but it never managed to do this on a regular base.  And at the moment that I did it, it worked really well. This could be pretty important because sort of, I think I know what I need to write about in order to be valuable for that audience.  And I think maybe what you did, you wrote something, I saw it and I merely thought, I need to, I interacted with it.  And so, someone with sort of known unknowns, he reads the right and he knows that he's out of options.  think someone like that will read something I write and then think,  hell, I think this guy now knows more about something like that.  I think, I know it's sort of the broader audience, but within that, I think it's hard to find people that are sort of explicit in, I don't know a lot of stuff, because most people don't say they don't know stuff, but when they read it, they know that they don't know, and that's the moment maybe that they sort of reach out.  So I think that inbound marketing or inbound, traffic cross could be a source of stuff.

17:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And do you have like things, because the way you talk about this, I sense a lot of pattern recognition, right, which is a sign of expertise, like you see this sign and you know that this is all probably moving this way, and it probably makes sense, right?  have you noticed stuff like time, for instance, founders, that I've had their companies for three years are more likely to be, you know, open to us than we found that I've had their company for like six months.  Is this something you've noticed?

18:12 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Yes, definitely. Yes, for time, place I think is one distinctive factor. So if they haven't been working on the proposition for, I think they should have been working on the proposition for at least a year, and maybe even two, but let's say a year, so that they have time enough sort of to try stuff.  So if they've been working on the proposition for, say, six months, they probably have done stuff, but it's still, I think, on a pink cloud.  So they still think they have options and that they know a lot and it's like trying to sell a pension to someone who is 25, just start the first job.  They're not interested. They don't they don't see it yet. So they have to have done more than only that to find out.  , this is important. I need I need to range or become an entrepreneur. But I think time is indeed crucial.  You have to have done stuff, try stuff and see that it didn't work. Hide people, see that it was wrong, hire and try to sort of the things that you know or within your reach.  And at some point, you sort of, yeah, you're out of options, but you still have sort of the fight going on.  You still think that you, that there's a problem. You might not be wrong. You just don't know how to solve and it's also not up to you anymore to know what options you can try now.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.

19:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now I'd like to move in to ask you a little bit more about like your views on this whole productization.  Because like from your website, I saw a couple of things like there's the subscription model which is kind of in that space and I mean clearly this is something you know about and you've been experimenting with.  So you have first-hand knowledge of how it happens, right? When it comes to your business specifically. So can you tell me a little bit more about productization and stuff like this at your company?

20:32 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  So what my, so a little bit about, yeah, look at the website so you also look at it and know if it's an experiment but at least work in progress.  We also, so I think this is sort of might be part of the challenge for us is that we still haven't found out yet how to write it down but also don't know how to write or offer down.  one, so one thing. So, as I said, I'm not a consultant, the startups that we focus on are pre-product market fits, so this is important.  If you have product market fits and you have sort of, you can prove that you have it, then there's no work for me here, because there are different work to do.  So the work that I do together with a few people that I work with, we're in search mode. So, this is a founder or a startup team, they sort of came up with an idea, an idea of solution or a problem that they wanted to solve, and they started to see if they can solve the problem or build a solution.  And so, the first phase is of the product market fits, and in that phase everything is research, which my customer was probably trying to solve, as I assumed, was it different?  This is solution, doesn't work, we want to pay for all those stuff. is all search, and as soon as you have found stuff, then you can sort of start executing a bit as well, especially when you want to be profitable also ASAP.  You need to start selling stuff, but also a small scale, because you might need to change stuff, because you're not there yet, but most times don't even reach product market fit.  So there's an enormous market there. So that's one thing that's great. There's an enormous market, and it will always be there, because a lot of people start a company, most won't make it to product market fit.  They quite a few out there get think they're a scale up, but they're not. And they are only a scale up, because they manage to get funded.  And funding is, for most companies, of the case of debt, because they don't have for the market figure, you have the money, so they start doing things that fit scale up, but not the startup.  Yeah, for instance, but also doing things on more scale and, I don't know, putting up ads, for instance, but it's in the search mode that you where everything is full and vulnerable and you need for the goal lost and you can't find gold if you blow up things.  So if you make it smaller, that is where where you find it. It's in the details, it's in connecting data, it's in, and there's no real playbook also for it.  So this is a combination of yeah, experience, I would say, what experience is starting things, so no way to look for.  So I don't have I can't predict the future, but I do know what is important in a customer interview, what to look for or how to ask questions or how not to ask questions because I did that a lot as well and I know where you can end up.  So it's not that I know what the solutions look like or I know what the problem is, but I am at least better than someone who does it for the first time in knowing which for you don't want to make or where you can speed up things or what you don't want to look at.  And so it's not that I guarantee a successful startup, but I do know that if I work with you together and so I don't tell you what to do and I work with the side by side, do stuff.  So this I think is what differentiates us from and from incubators, but also from VCs or angels or we actually do stuff because I can tell someone to experiment or to do.  But he doesn't know how to do it, he or she, and this is what's crucial. So, and especially in testing assumptions, it's crucial that you know how to do it and it takes more time to tell me to tell someone how to do it and then you still  it up then we do it ourselves.  Absolutely. But our hours are not scalable. So this is where we, where I, productization is, can be a thing and in the things that we do.  But finding out about, let me rephrase it. my experience is that people that I work with, they within say three hours or a day or they have experienced value.  And value then is not that in that I say brilliant things or what this guy knows it all because we.  always start working with their proposition, with their problems, and within an hour or three hours or a day, we have looked at data, it, put up assumptions, and so they within very short time frame already have a very different perspective on what it is that they have managed so far.  And so the moment that I started working with these startups, it's not that we look at the but we look at the past.  So what have they done until now? And I think this is also when back to it's time, it's time relevant, as so the more they've done, the more data's available, and it's just that they haven't looked at the data the way they do, or they don't, they don't know that something is important, and something else is less important.  And one day, so we asked them, we'd be a few of those workshops, which didn't end up as in sort of product yet, but we asked them, for instance, for some input, so if you deliver us this, the customer data or for your data now, and then in three hours, we looked at sort of those data, and then we plot the business model as they think that it should be or as they have built until now, and then we take these data, and then it's nothing is easy, but for us, it's sort of easy to plot the data also, and we use the known frameworks like this model campus and the process of customer development, and then we say based on what you tell us or business data, you say that you are here, and if you operate, but when we look at these data, we think that you have  you think it's one segment, we think that it's four segments. And we think that this segment, that this is one that you focus on, but it's because you try to manage all this is where, for instance, all the different reviews come from, where person A says this and person B says that and sort of we add our knowledge and if we start with them, we also add some skills and it's mainly on setting up experiments and running experiments.  That's also one-time things, we don't do repetition tasks and we combine with their knowledge of the problem of, they know about their business and when you combine it too and there's actual data that we can take then in a very short period of time the whole world looks different for them because they have never looked at stuff like that or they are not aware  They might have heard of it, but it's just a static thing, so they filled it out once and then threw it away.  It is a static thing, but when you combine with the customer development process, it already becomes sort of a living thing.  But if you then combine with things like the innovation adoption cycle and not as static things, but you plot the data on there and then then all of a sudden it sort of comes alive and you can blame with the frameworks in combination with the real data and what they know and what we know about how to get from zero to one.  That is where it starts. Where also they see sort of options again or if you look at it like this.  Then then then all of sudden there's an enormous amount of work to do or things that they shouldn't be doing anymore or where they can save money because he spent a shitload on advertisement made or Google or.  And the key is that I need to get work with these people as soon as possible, and to work with them, mean, I think that's where you role created me, that the things that you talk about are, I think, we need these things to get across what we know, what we can do, and it's not because we talk about stuff, when I ride on LinkedIn, they can be triggered and they might know stuff, but the actual aha, so if you talk about the time to the value, I think it is in stuff like this that you talked about, that we sort of can, in very short period of time, of already prove something, because we can say them, say  something to show them something with their data, and they think what the . And I think these are the crucial steps to, okay, I never ever want to let go of these guys, because that's sort of the...  that's sort of the effectiveness. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  had written here a moment of clarity at that moment. And do you... I mean, I want to be mindful of the time.  We have...

31:30 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  I have more time, but I don't know if you have more Yeah, no, I also have more time, but it's good that you keep focus on.  Okay, so you still need to sell me stuff as well. also need to... No, I don't need to sell you stuff.

31:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm getting a lot from you. It sells itself. That's a great thing for what you do. So correct me if I'm wrong, right?  So what I'm getting here is that the picture I'm getting is that you have your... your company, you yourself, you have like these first-hand expertise, you've seen this, you have done this, you see that it works.  You also have a picture of who this serves. And you know that you are obviously more aware than most that there's a specific set of characteristics.  And there's some signs you can see from the outside, like time, or if they got in some sort of investment, or they just exit the incubator, something like that.  There's like signs you can pick up and get there. And there's awareness of what people, what are like the moments of truth when people interact with you, like, oh, I see like, it's not, it's not sterile inside, it's like inside in my situation.  Okay, this is, I had gold and I didn't know I had gold and this guy showed me the gold that was inside, which is great.  And so coming back into the the productization, I, I also assume that the point is that this experience of seeing you and your partner or your team giving this thing, it's not scalable, right?  needs a little bit of time and so on. One of the things that you've mentioned is that you did a couple of customized workshops, and one of the questions I had in mind was, what made it necessary to customize those workshops?  Did people ask for the customization? How was the process of deciding to customize the workshop?

33:33 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  I don't know if that was a workshop, did I customize or did I did a workshop and there was a need for a workshop at all?

33:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's the first question, the first interpretation, so you did a workshop that was customized. Let me open your message here, it's going to be better.  But basically, I think the question behind the question is, what made you feel that you needed to make not a vanilla workshop, but the customized workshop?

34:13 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  Did you say vanilla workshop? Yeah, I loved it. So, my assumption is that this is one of the challenges that I have, is that the moment that it sort of, I tend to make it more challenging where it gets boring, where at least in my opinion it gets boring or where the news is off or, but this neatly causes sort of the risk that things don't, are not closed, that it's not finished, that it's wrapping around and then it's a product, it's a workshop because there's always,  something that can be added or that it's, if I do this, then this is also something that sort of prevents me from writing more than anything, because the moment I start writing, the ideas get flowing and then before I know it, the initial idea is gone or it's still there, but it's, yeah, and then I can't finish it because I can, because I added stuff and I cannot sort of bring it back through the simple thing that I had in mind when I started it.  So this is, I think, one of the challenges, same goes for the works of that and I might start with a simple idea and if I put a wrap around, I might already solve the problem for quite lot of people, could be what, because I added stuff in my mind at least or maybe even on sort of paper.  It's hard to go back sort of to the, okay, but what is the, what is sort of the simplified version again?  So I find out that sort of AI helps me a lot here that I can sort of. have someone else tell me sort of okay but now go back to where what the goal is and so this really helps me to sort of not go all over the place so at the same point this is exactly the way that I sort of when I work with started with founders that because the way my brain works it's that I keep things faster or that I combined stuff that they don't see so that is a one-ant it's it's in the things that I do it really helps but in in sort of presenting me or the team at Vellivange it's sort of it's I think it's an enormous killer because it's never finished and I can't sort of not for myself it's hard to to to to well post an article that's not finished that I'm a little bit  I can tell all this that they should, but for myself, it's hard, know so well what you're talking about.

37:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I really, really connect with that feeling. So yeah, I know what you mean. Just of, this is not part of the interview.  Are you familiar with the book, The Business of Expertise?

37:21 - Wilfred Stegeman (Valley Ventures)
  No.

  I really like it. I recommend it to everybody. It's from David C. The Business of Expertise. It has a red cover.  And so this guy has been around for a while, and he really knows his ICP. It's strange, right? You're reading the book and it's like, oh my, this guy has been spying on me.  And one of the things he talks about, about experts, is that experts are very curious. That's how you get to be an expert.  And part of that curiosity sometimes leads you to distract yourself in the work. Like, you want to make... You want to explore like what's what's possible and then eventually you step away from what other people can understand because you are at another level and there's even like a high likelihood that you're probably more intelligent than the average so this makes things even more complex right.  And one of the things that this guy talks about. Is that you know. Entrepreneurial experts that what he calls like solar consultants and stuff like that they need to have interesting personal lives and and not try to make their work super interesting.  And that was really a slap in my face because I was always like playing with Lego in my business like oh so if I do this thing technique right.  And that was really intense for me so this is not part of the interview but here I could see myself totally.

  Yeah, I mean, or it's in the book. So then I'm going to read the book by the way, it's in the book.

  I can send you like, there's all the stuff I wrote about it. It's kind of personal. think we kind of see the world in the same way.  So it's no problem. You won't judge me. think and but yeah, I think this is this is frequent for highly curious people that need to, you know, create their own jobs because they're so curious.  They don't fit into the normal. Corporate structures.
