0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't interrupt you, I'll tell you what's that. No, not really.

0:04 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I'm just going to do is pin you, so I'm looking at you and not the reading and taking those things.  So let's do that. Yeah. So, okay, so what I've managed to do is build a brand in the digital transformation space.  I know a lot of thought leaders, expert practitioners in the space across all of the main disciplines of digital transformation, which is fairly much everything, because digital transformation in itself is a context, necessarily a thing, but it is the context within which everything is accelerated.  So there's the requirement for people, products, and services to help organizations be successful in digital transformation, and that's getting more urgent because of AI.  So that's accelerated the external change. Combine that with the need for large organizations that they They're less inclined to go to large consulting firms now and more inclined to go to smaller consulting firms, beteaks who can provide sort of bespoke services to help them on their learning journey to be successful digital transformation, because just the transformation is about how you become, it's about how you operate, it's not about digital, it's about people and how they now work differently and very often that means that the facilitation of that is people working closely, working with coaches, mentors, makers to get you over issues, a lot of stuff that you've discussed.  alignment collaboration, maybe strategy, challenging assumptions, you know, there's all sorts of things that lock the successful outcomes that they're looking for in terms of going for digital transformation.  And so what I'm trying to do is close that gap. these people onto these client sites, but to make it easier to do that, to productise what it is that they're offering, to help them articulate what it is that they're actually offering, make them easier to buy.

2:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Can I paraphrase a little bit of what I got so far?

2:23 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Of course. Yeah.

2:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I everything seemed very, very cohesive. When I came to Brazil, I did work in like digital transformation. That's how I got into the facilitation thing.  So, I fully, I think I see, I see what you see. if I were to synthesise kind of the last paragraph of what you said is like, so on one side, we have like this world getting faster, more abstract, weirder, and we need to have more contextualised approaches to it.  It's not just like whatever framework or book that was, a few years ago and you just followed that recipe.  So you need that more contextualized and smaller consulting firms, consultancies are probably better at this and also like individual or very nano consulting firms are better at this.  They're more agile in the sense of adaptable. So on one way, we have like that on the demand side, I suppose.  on the supply side, you have all these experts and entrepreneurial experts in the words of David Baker that they might need to learn how to sell to corporates, right?  Yep. Did I get it? it like this? Yes.

3:48 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, so I talked to quite a few people who are experts and they, I mean, they're spending their time doing marketing,  And they're struggling, you know, they're not getting enough stuff through. So they're good at doing, but they're not very good at marketing.  So they're not getting the volume of work through that they would be able to do. There's been too much time marketing.  And so we can help them with that. We've got quite a lot of brand in the digital transformation space and But rather than rather than What I'm interested in is really To help them package what they do in a way which is recognized by the customer is something which is going to give them outcomes.  So these consultants solve problems. Customers have problems, but the way the consultants currently market themselves, it's not really clear what problems.  So what they tend to do at the moment go to market through referrals, personal recommendations and stuff. And that's not really scalable.  you know, they join networks because they want to extend their network to get their next gig. But they don't have anything they can tangibly market.  Whereas if they package themselves, we could help them more if we could help them articulate what problems they solve.

5:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm part of a community like this, it's in Brazil, it's called the consulting school, and it's really focused on independent consulting, and what I really like about it, and it is not one of those modern, sleazy, high ticket sales sort of thing, it's like they're quoting Meister, and Shein, and all of these guys, and really thinking about the ethos of consulting and how you, how you, because it's a very special kind of life as well, right, it's not just, I mean there's an aspect of course making a living, but there's also an aspect of the sort of life you have, and pursue your intellectual career as it is, and make a living from it.  And I see a lot of these of what you say, smart, clever, which people that they are now turning into this more independent thing and there's a whole set of new skills that they need to at least to understand and oftentimes they fall prey to what's the most legible i love the word legible what's the most legible supplier of this so they end up hiring digital agencies that will make a beautiful website but tell them nothing about their offering you know stuff like this or they'll launch a podcast and spend a lot of money on the studio time and nobody listens to that podcast stuff like this yeah so i think we are seeing the same sort of patterns yeah yeah well there's a lot there's lots of one thing you'll notice on link team is that it's mainly consultants talking to consultants so i think it's an i spoke to somebody yesterday who told me that they have never they haven't had a single lead from link 10 it may be that they've extended their network through link 10 and

7:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  and LinkedIn is a proof point so it's the first place you will look so you'll see oh okay so now I get it and I've read their articles then but the articles themselves are not going to don't necessarily bring in business but maybe it supports it when they hear about you through other means or maybe they've heard about you but they're not visibly engaging with you.  So sometimes you get business in and you don't know where it's come from and they say well I've seen you on and I have that I have lots of people that I kind of almost feel like I know them and that I rate what they do because I see what they're talking about and they don't know about me but I know about them so so I will find them if I then need their services if that makes me.  And I spent a long time in the digital transformation space categorizing good people because I've been publishing their content and tracking other people who can publish content for me as well.  So I've been looking at creating a a supplier directory, for example, on the website where we can articulate what it is that these people, individuals, do, again, trying to articulate what problems they solve.
  ACTION ITEM: Review workshop materials João will send - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/spsuuLZJutDRL8vsdqY6eqZ7h61GEyvc?timestamp=491.9999  But what I thought looking at your stuff is that I was interested to know how you would take that IP and help them productize it.  So they've got something to take to market.

8:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my current approach is, I think for most people, or at least the most, because this is a very meta thing, right?  I'm doing this also for myself. So I sometimes it becomes a fractal. But the stage I am right now is that I'm noticing I'm dealing more with people at the beginning of this journey, right?  And what they need is like their first offer, their first product, the first thing, like the fishing line from David Fields.  That's the angle I'm exploring with people now. Just step away from, oh, I have like these decades of experience.  I want to talk about all of it. No, no, let's just find one thing that makes them, and then from there you build the trust and so on.  So I'm looking at shading the first product or the first engagement, something that is strategic in the sense that it stays within a price point and effort and time, that it's easy to say yes to, but at the same time it's smart and is aware of other services you might provide, and I've been using the analogy of it as an API to other services you have.  So the output of this first thing could be used for other things, right? And then you already have the context and it's easy to keep hiring you.  That's my approach right now. I think in the future, but it's also a funnel, right? start to get less people at that stage if they're more sophisticated.  There's other things that I think could be interesting like. more like flagship workshops and like more like I think the best example or the most known example is the business model canvas kind of thing.  So they have like this one idea.

10:15 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So when you just what you've just described is that something that you are building for your business or is something that you are helping consultants build for their businesses or both?  It's kind of both.

10:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a few transparency. I've been doing this sort of creating workshops for others because my wife is an independent consultant and I came from the design thinking world and I'm like oh if you do this and she works in corporate compliance which is a little bit of a dry environment and it was really useful to set her apart in this context.  Like she does things because it stays at the intersection of three things that I'm fascinated by. One is the concept of  of I like that. And the other, the other one is like a more systematic view of things, see some thinking.  And the third one is fun. I like jokes and films and games. So in the intersection of this, it's like funny businesses would be an interesting phrase to synthesize that.  So I started doing that. And I was like, I'm doing this. I love doing it. I could do more of this.  And then I started on that journey that consultant's going, like, how do I package this, right? And I'm shifting.  I haven't done it that that that cross yet, that transition yet from the referral aspect towards a more self-directed, you know, self-reliant approach to getting, getting business.  So I am building my own offer. Yes. Yeah.

11:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  you're breaking through with your marketing rather than going through because it's clear what you do now. So it's I noticed you're connected to Nick him a bit, you know, Nick?

11:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yes. I've spoken to Great guy, a really nice talk to him.

12:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, very nice. So, know, he's a business model Canvas person. He's a good guy.

12:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's funny. More people have asked me if I know Nick, because I think especially in the UK, a lot of people know him and everybody has good things to save on him.  So that's nice. Yeah, yeah.

12:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  He's quite visible. He's very good at brand building for himself. So, he puts very good content out. So, yeah, I bet it kind of, it kind of, most people that would be interested or aware of workshops in this sort of space will probably be aware of Nick, because it's kind of what he does, if that means.  So, Anyway, so, okay. So, what's your ambition with this in terms of building your business? How do you want to what's your plan?  Well, I say plan, but what's your ambition?

12:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ambition is a good word. I want to be known for, so the brand building aspect is important, the authority building aspect is important.  I want to be known for workshops that work, and they're fun, but they're not about fun. They're about getting results, impact-driven workshops and stuff like that, for service business.  My nemesis is the HR for a 15-building stuff that creates a bad reputation for workshops. I think it's, because I mean, you come from digital transformation, everything we've said, we share a lot of rapport and perspective, they work, mean, these ways of bringing emotional and focused DJ, and this, you you adjust these knobs, and these things work.  work. So it's really, in my opinion, is a shame. It's a bit hard to understand even how this is not more widespread.  think everybody that runs services businesses should have a minimum level of competence with this stuff. I'm on the hiring side for some services, agency things, and mostly as an advisor to my wife helping her deal with some guys.  And he's insane, how much better things could be if that marketing agency has a better process to brief things, debrief things, render.  I mean, you know exactly what I mean.

14:43 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  When you say that, is that in the context of a workshop or general, just general communication?

14:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a good point. I'm using workshops as a recognizable word. Because I think it is the more abstract or deeper, I don't know, than workshops, is ways of working, is ways of communicating, it's a whole network of approaches to things, right?  But I figured, and I'm interested in that, but the circle of where I am most competent is workshops. And I'm aware that there's like these adjacent areas that I know they are there, I might have crossed into them at some point, but I don't want to try and position myself as somebody that really knows his stuff on that.  Yeah, okay.

15:36 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  But it's a nice niche. And as you say, it's the entry point. So it gives your customers something as an entry point.  So it's a bigger market, I suspect, for you anyway. So, so what sort of...

15:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you've, I think you've, I think you've got a conversation about what sort of business. Can I rewind 15 seconds?  think if for a second, what is your question, please? It's really just your process then.

16:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So if you come across an organization that can do with your help, what's the process that you've taken through?  the outcome of that process and do you have sort of examples of people you work with and so is the other thing I'm interested in is what would it cost to work with you to take an organization and get them to a point where they can take their IP and now they have workshops so they can introduce to customers.

16:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the process it starts with, I like the culinary analysis, like ISM is and plus. You see what you have in terms of projects you have done, services you have realized, not things you are interested in.  I think it's important for like curious experts is like you have done this thing either as a consultant or previously in your career.  So we make an inventory, is that what I'm saying?

16:58 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, could be, yes, inventory.

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  of all of that, you know, real empirical experience. And then we understand how the different services could be sequenced, right?  Not the steps within the services, but which service would fit better. Some people look at these like a lather, I think it's a useful way, but I think it's a bit, the lather perspective is too, it has too much of that Russell Branson online sales DNA.  And Alex or Moses things. mean, there's very interesting knowledge in what they talk about. just that the approach doesn't connect with me as much.

17:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Are you talking about a marketing funnel here? you talking about yeah, yeah.

17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's that approach of the marketing funnel, which I think is useful to know, but I don't think it's so interesting to me.  So I prefer the idea of, like your services are on a territory, right? And then you can drive. Maps and it's like oh to get from here to there.  We should go through this other service Yeah, unless so about just you know raising prices and going up in the value added.  Yeah, that's useful But it's a it's a different game. I'm more interested in the other game For now at least so basically so we understand everything you have at your disposal both in experience skills referrals the network you have then we sequence Like the ideal sequence and then we pick one of these services to to really tune it up It's important that is something that you have been doing or have done in the past so we are less on the assumption of side of things and more on the amplification side of Yeah, and then we pick What's like aha moment where people really get you for instance in on my side?  I've noticed that whenever I open Mero and see me handling Miro, but what I do is what makes them like, oh, okay, you get it, for the people it's different things.  So you find this aha moment and then you shape that engagement around staging that aha moment and having several small ones, of course.  And now you have the thing that you want to elevate, right? And you slice it in three parts. What happens before the engagement?  And this could be because you're so knowledgeable about this. So I think much of what I'm saying is obvious to you, but for others, it isn't.  So things that happen before the workshop, this could be like assessments like Daniel Priestley and Skarkar marketing, that sort of project.  This could be just helping you get more context on that clients or you have better examples to use on the workshop or just give them an opportunity to vent.  in a way that doesn't take over the time in the workshop because this happens, right?

20:04 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

20:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you arrive at the workshop, everybody's ready, and you need to build the workshop. The way I think about workshops is that they are way of getting to answers, and to think about answers, again, the analogy of the mis and plus works for me.  So there's information I have, there's the recipe I would like to make, and there's things that are missing, and for this, this, either information or decisions or interactions that are missing, some workshop activities work better than others, right?  Right. So I start from there, so there's something I have, something I want to make and something that's missing, and then I figure out, okay, for what's missing, I think this is the best thing to do, and we pick them, and we build the workshop in terms of activities.  Yeah. And there's like other things around it, connecting activities and so on. If you are really... But I think for most people, what I'm going to say is not necessary, but if you're really interested in signaling the value of workshop, taking it a step further, I think there's another layer, which is the aesthetics layer, not just visually, but like thematically.  So... So...

21:19 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Thematically.

21:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thematically.

21:21 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

21:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  As an overall... Yeah. So, an example that I think is too on the nose is like, oh, we are going on a journey, okay?  This is too much on the nose. But then you have other things that are a little bit more subtle.  Like the sort of words you use, the sort of frameworks you bring in or visuals, I think they are more towards the branding expertise angle of things.  So, like further guys expertise and then you can brand that expertise. So if you build a workshop, you have all the sequences.  in terms of like, deliverables, what this means is like, there's a workshop script with times and activities and outputs for everything.  This looks like a spreadsheet. I found that it's a format that people instantly grasp. Usually there's a facilitation guide that is written to be printed and so that people, if they feel safer with it, they could have it and it's easy to navigate.  And the assets. So this could be like a visual campus or like the mirror boards. So you know what happens when with the script?  You know how to run it and then you have the assets. Yeah. And sometimes the assets include different things.

22:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And this is something that you that you help the the expert prepare. Yes.

22:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

22:52 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  This is an outcome from working with you that they will have all of those things. Yeah. And the initial part of that is you help them determine what the key value proposition is.  You look at all the bits.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you go right we're zoning in on this this is how you would articulate it this now we're going to do that we're going to theme it just going to look like so consistency branding presumably through the workshop these are the three elements you're going to have then they then they practice and and yeah do you provide any post um any any support thereafter things that i've done are you know teaching the workshop to the person train the trainer nobody has ever asked me to to do this but i offer the attend the workshop as like a participant say nothing but just you know be there and then hold their hand i suppose and provide feedback but so far nobody asked for or include it in the in the conversation a chat like a month or sometime afterwards  Because, especially at this stage of my business, I really need people to be successful with this, so I need the referrals and the testimonials and stuff like that.  So I have a selfish incentive to make sure that it works for them. So to me, that's important.

24:19 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  How many consulting businesses have you worked with to pull precious?

24:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think four or five. Because most of my business is much so much easier to be transparent. So most of my, I've done this several times from my wife's company and I charge her invoice right out of the whole thing.  But I don't think it's a very attractive sort of case that I'm working with. So I've done many for her, three or four and even physical products, decks of cards, that sort of thing.  And then I've done it for agencies, two agencies, one automation agency and another more. or like traffic agency ads and stuff like that.  Yeah. And I'm doing it now for, it's so funny. I'm doing it for a company that is specialized in IP productification.  So for that one, I'm working on more like a contractor. So it's less me delivering the whole thing. But they just are like, oh, I think you know how to do this and they called me.  And yeah, for the workshops, that's it. And then I'm doing other things less around workshops, but for workshops, that's it.  Right.

25:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  OK. this is your new direction, really, built on your previous experience.

25:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, positioning is recent. I've been doing this for a while, but not knowing how to talk about it.  And now I'm realizing that I'm learning how to talk about it. So I'm having more of these conversations.

25:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, OK, now it's interesting. So. Okay, so I'm sort of working on something. I'm taking one I've got and I'm formulating it into something new, but I think workshops is going to be a key part of it.  Just because it helps people articulate, it gives me something I can actually offer to customers, so I can help them solve this problem with these, this organisation.  So rather than say, these consultants are the best, because everybody says they are and they do all this stuff.  Rather than that, I would engage the customer on, okay, and this is a problem that we're going to solve for you.  And this is how we're going to do it. So it's workshop first, consultancy second.

26:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like that that approach of focusing on what they can understand. Yeah, it's like a Trojan horse, right?

26:52 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. And then I like that. And so what I'm interested in doing is learning how we can. do that to working with consultants that we would work with to take them through the process of doing that.  So there will be a cost associated, I presume, working with you to do that for them. So if I said, okay, here is somebody who'd be interested in going through this process with you, you know, what's it going to cost?  The other thing, just as a matter of interest, is if we could assemble a number of consultants, then maybe there is a sort of community type webinar type thing that we could do like a workshop for them, which would be like a lead generation for you, but somewhere where we can add some value for them.  So I've got a community, which isn't really a community to be fair. I've managed to get 1,400 people into an environment where they've signed up and gone that way, this is great.  And then they bug it off and haven't really come back again because I haven't really managed to get the community piece going up.  around content. So I curated a lot of content about digital transformation to help people learn what it is and in the context of their own role.  And it was good because I got business schools referring their executive education students, which is also good. But to get a community to engage by end supply side, don't really engage with each other.  Yes, by side are probably too busy doing other things to worry about content. They can get content anyway. And they, if they're going to talk, they prefer to do it in a very tight private peer to peer, not where there are supply side.  So I haven't really managed to get that working yet. But I think that within the supply side thing, okay, you are the companies we're going to help do this.  So here is a community where you can all learn together about doing your workshops or doing your marketing or understanding your proposition or  or how to niche down or something, they're more likely to talk, provided they are relatively non-compete. But you know, like how to do a workshop is not a competitive thing.  It's like learning how to sell, isn't it? It doesn't matter. content is different, but the approach is the same.

29:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree with that, but there's a little caveat. If they are going to build their own workshop together, it becomes competitive again.  Because they were like, oh, I don't want this guy to see. I've been thinking about this and I agree with you.  But I think there are ways of navigating that.

29:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So that's kind of where I'm at. It sounds like we're in similar stage because myself sort of formulating and yours is as well.  But think we're getting to the point where there's this probably quite an area. where we can collaborate on something in the sense that we're in the same sort of vicinity.  So what sort of, as an example, what sort of, if you had a consulting firm that said, okay, we need some help with this, how long would that, what would a sort of the typical project look like and how much would you charge them to get from A to B, would you say?

30:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think six weeks you have a standalone thing in your hands, both in all the deliverables I said and then even the process we talked about.  Pricing, I'm still struggling with that, but I think for now, given that I kind of need more cases, I've been thinking around not for solos, I think it's got to be cheaper, but for companies I've been thinking about  maybe $5,000. Right.

31:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. And that's for the six weeks. Yeah, for the for the full thing you buy the outcome. And that's US dollars, is it?  Yes.

31:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

31:18 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  That's opposed to whatever else it might be. Now, if you were in the eyes and versus the new numbers, it would be what I everybody's number there.  Okay. So, okay, now that's, that's fine. So you're finding your pricing really and probably finding those and that's also fine.  What sort of in terms of are you coming across other people doing this similar sort of thing to you?

31:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to say no, but I'll explain why it took so long. So specifically workshops for consultants, I haven't found anyone and I'm not sure this is a great sign.  okay. Yeah, I think it's kind of a bad sign. But before the workshops, I was more focused. I had a more a broader approach and I was like productize expertise and there's a lot of people doing that.  And I was like, okay, so because productize expertise, there's so many things around it. There's like aspects that are more I'll say the nerdy aspects of it, like a method, the framework and so on.  But I think that word productize expertise has been associated a lot with like online courses and, you know, monetizing expertise, not productizing monetizing, which is slightly different.  And in that world, I'm not the course guy. I've never. put together of course. So I have no qualifications to say that I help productize if people come to me thinking about courses and that probably will.  So for workshops yeah I've done it and I can talk about it. So yeah I haven't found people doing the workshop thing for others.  I have found people doing like build your framework, build your course, build your coaching offer, that kind of thing I found.

33:29 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay interesting. Yeah so I think it's good to go in with the workshops scenario. It's a tangible outcomes. All customers know what a workshop is.  They've probably experienced in the past and then there's going to be an outcome. think they're a valuable tool because there's knowledge is commodity so you can get the knowledge that you need.  what you actually need is people in the room. context contextually solving the problem together because you because that way you get alignment, collaboration, ownership of the decision that's being made and more like action and so a workshop is is a way to do that if you call it a consultancy or advisory and you start making it frameworks they become tools to sell advisory.  So you're just another consultant. So you're not solving that problem. You're selling yourself, which is a different thing, I think.  So I think it's better to go in as a workshop because the workshops for you, the customer. I'll come in and help you work through this process where you're going to end up solving your problem as opposed to here's a framework which going to help me deliver my solution.  It's slightly different. Again, I could be wrong. And with what I'm working on, there's an element that requires validation as well.  yeah, I'd be interested in sort of getting as you as your proposition becomes more clear to you and more tangible.  then I can do the same with what I'm doing and we can we can explore how we could maybe work together on some of the things where we can help each other.  I think what I can help you with is access to volume people who are going through these who will be going through these sorts of thoughts.  You just that we could we could introduce the idea you know through whatever means community or content or whatever it happens to be then that might be an outside for you.  But yeah there's like there's lots of things in the air and we have to see how they how they fall.  So I'm working on something at the moment which is slightly beyond digital transformation people but it will be digital transformation people gives us an advantage.  So I'm looking to capitalize on that, but get more focused in terms of what our offering will be.

36:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure if I fully got it, so then this new thing you're working on, it's still as a digital transformation people, aspect of connecting experts to corporates, but there's another angle that you are exploring, is that it?

36:21 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, this is slightly different angle, so yeah, so that's where I'm at, so like I said, formulating and learning about workshops and looking at who I can work with to create more value for both sides in this time I'm interested in.

36:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's great, I mean, do you mind if I just take some very specific questions?

36:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, I mean, I don't mind.

36:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you, my interpretation is that this whole thing about productisation, because you come from this very context dependent world, and you see the value of productisation.  Do you remember how you came across that, oh, this makes sense to me. Do you remember the shift or the click moment?

37:20 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Oh, I kind of do. I remember having that thought. I probably written it down a note somewhere, but it's maybe, do you know Luke Smayers?

37:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I like stuff.

37:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Right, so he talks about nishing down, and I think he might have mentioned productising at some point. So it makes something which is intangible into something which is tangible.  So a product people and people can relate to. So anyway, in terms of when I picked that up, I think maybe it was something that I read in relation to Luke Smaz, or the other person you might know is Joe Ohmahoney?

38:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes.

38:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so they're the two principal people that are consulting with consulting firms, boutique firms. So I'm sure that they've come up with something a long that time, but it it's easiest to sell then services by the consulting firms have, you know, they have their frameworks and things like that.  If it's got sort of this is what we do, it's easier to hang a conversation around that and to visually take somebody through a process where the outcome is something good for that person you're saying to.  Whereas if you just line up and say we're really great people and we know all this stuff, we'll come and work with you.  Yeah, so, yeah, anyway, yeah, ask me the next question, that, did that give you any clarity, probably not, but it's...

39:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, this is helpful because you mentioned both the references and also what's, know, got your eye, which I wrote down as from the intangible to the tangible, selling invisible is a challenge, right?

39:24 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, why did you ask the question, might have been interesting.

39:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I'm trying to learn more about how people think about these things because you, you know about workshops, right?  But some people do not know about workshops, and if I just talk about workshops, it will just fly over them, and I need to understand how people come into this, right?  And, yeah, that was it.

39:47 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's interesting, you said I know about workshops because I probably don't really know about workshops, and I've been in a few, but I don't really know about them, and there's a...  I was going to ask you about the final line between a workshop and... training. How much is a workshop and environment where you maybe have a plan of action or solve a problem as opposed to training?  I think that one of my areas of interest with digital transformation is I actually think one of the challenges is the requirement to upskill people or to help them see a way forward to unlock things like lack of alignment, lack of strategic direction, politics, fear, all of those things can be unlocked in a workshop environment.  But there's an element of education. So from people coming outside who bring knowledge inside into the context and share that knowledge and help people consume it in a way where they get that aha moment and the outcome is okay, now we know this, now we know our way forward.  So the question might be, okay, what are we going to, what, what, What's our strategy or why are you losing customers?  So let's figure that out. Let's go to the root cause and now let's build a plan.

41:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love this question because so many people use workshops in a misguided way, like the word.

41:18 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  say the workshop is not really workshop.

41:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So workshops, they always have attention to outcome and they are guided collaboration. So they are guided collaboration to reach a certain outcome.  Some outcomes are more tangible than others. So for instance, on one end, you have just authority. Now we know what's happening.  This is useful, this is valuable, right? On the other end, you might come all the way to the point of we have an artifact that will help us execute on this plan.  So basically, the way I see it is that you have clarity. You might have a decision, let's go this way.  You can have clarity without a decision. right or the decision you can have a plan which is a set of decisions and you can have an artifact which I think the artifact is a bit of a catch-all phrase because it could be like a commitment device stuff like that yeah and it could even be like a spreadsheet that is this is ready for everybody to use after the workshop because think this is where most workshops fit right they do not connect with business as usual and then people they like the moment some of them and that but it is an expensive moment both for the facilitation and the time and the focus is expensive right and if they don't see how it affects the rest of their work it just feels like weeks later is like this was a waste of time and I think that's the missed opportunity so I think workshops have that any comes of training and workshops I think workshops could be used for training if the skills that you want to teach  are skills that need to be practiced. For instance, let's say you want to help people handle conflict better, or handle uncertainty, or all of these things that are complex.  I think teaching them, oh, this is the framework of conflict resolution. This is not as useful as this is the framework, and now we'll have a little bit of time to role play this framework.  And then we will evaluate how we felt doing this, and why do we see our gaps, right? So the training, I think, is more related to the purpose, and the workshop is more about the format.  You could have training that is just presentation. could have training in other formats. could have training like a book, a company bought a book.  That's your training. So I'll say they are not entirely orthogonal, but they're not the same thing. OK.

43:54 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  OK.

43:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, so I'll just. grab as much of your attention as I can, and from what I understand, you saw that this productization and the advantages of it.  A lot of it was that your own familiarity with your own audience, like you see them mentioning these pain points all the time, is that it?

44:26 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, to some extent, I can see it's not always clear when I talk to people, they don't articulate very well what it is that they do, and when people write to CV, they write what they've done and the inference is what they're good at, they don't actually, they don't write it in a way that says, and this is the problem that I solve, so I've kind of gone a step towards that in terms of trying to create profiles for people in the supply directory, and we publish the content.  which is normally them talking about something they position themselves as an expert and the influencer, so this guy's an expert, we'll contact them, but so that's one step.  The other step is just talking to consultants recently, the term workshop has come up more and more. I've just noticed it, maybe because I was thinking about it in terms of productisation, but without me prompting them, people saying, oh, we normally, we try to sell them this, but we normally go in and do a workshop first because you find it easier to sell.  And then we'll do blah, blah, because the workshop is a very good way to become intimately knowledgeable of that customer and the problems that they're stroking with.  And so you're perfectly positioned, you built the relationship, you're perfectly positioned and then to ourselves. I think that the risk with the workshop is that it would be  see if there's being a diagnostic and therefore people won't pay for it. So you've got to be clear that you do the diagnostic, well, workshop will solve that for you need to charge for the workshop, and then you need to upsell for the next piece of work.  So I've been working with talking to people quite lot about that sort of selling process. And you've probably been through this in terms of your business model.  I kind of reached a point where I hadn't cracked it in terms of being able to execute on what I'm doing.  And I was kind of a bit in the wilderness in terms of which direction do I go? Because I've got a lot of brand, I've got lot of knowledge, but I'm not an expert.  So I'm not the consultants, I'm a connector, you know, I ask me a question. I will find you the person with a solution.  But no, I'm not Nick Kim with it. So if you want to do business model canvas, go to talk to an egg.  My value add is recognising that's what you need to be doing and knowing Nick. If that makes sense.

47:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would assume that you have a very natural or it feels natural now telling to spot like a certain science of competence.  You're probably good at that.

47:21 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Where I'm sure I'm kind of interested and I'm quite knowledgeable but I'm not as process orientated as someone like Nick or as probably discipline.  I haven't learned that discipline of delivering going through that process. So I'll show you. My laptop is resting on these things.  And the other one is the business model canvas. So but I haven't read them quite as much as I should have done but I do know that I should read them and I'll recommend these people but if you really want to.  to Nick. And it's the same with a lot of consultancy firms. know which ones to talk to you about what it is that they do, but I'm not that consultant, but I know enough to know that that's the consultant you need to be talking to.  And I also know enough that if I want to solve this problem for myself, then that's the book that I need to read bit more of.  So I'm working through a value proposition design at the moment. I'm going through a business model canvas for myself looking at my business.  I'm looking at the probably much the same as you are, as the advisors, what are their pains and gains and jobs to be done?

48:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you done that?

48:42 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Have been through that?

48:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. And I've been doing that recently, and it was absolutely transforming, completely transforming. So I popped up in your radar, I think two weeks after I started doing this because I started  to shift the conversation from, hey, workshops are great for you into what's difficult about what you do. And it's a little bit embarrassing because I've been doing the innovation consulting, design workshops, design screen workshops, I've done that for more than a decade.  And I was telling people that they should be doing this. And then I was like, let me follow my own advice.  And it was insane, in four conversations with different people. Some of these people I knew already. So it's not like I had no access to this information.  It was there, I was just not asking it the right way. And I mean, I'm glad you're doing that.  I completely understand the feeling of this has been around and people tell me good, but I haven't done it.  And I started doing it and it's been really helpful.

49:50 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, you can get a superficial knowledge and thinking that you know it. So when you do it, you realize that they'll become junctuous where you have to make a decision all the way back.
  ACTION ITEM: Send João link to "Something the statue in the stone" book on jobs to be done - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/spsuuLZJutDRL8vsdqY6eqZ7h61GEyvc?timestamp=2999.9999  It means they. Yes, yeah, I presume you're familiar with jobs to be done, you know, do you know about that?  Right, you do so One thing is the there's there's quite a lot stuff out at the moment first. Yeah, there's a really really good book Something the statue in the stone have you come across that?  No, no, but they want to see it I can send you a link. It's it's quite an in-depth book It's the best thing i've ever seen written on jobs to be done But the other thing is is the awareness of different contributors To the decision you have different jobs to be done.  So it's the same Thing you're trying to solve but they have a different perspective. Yeah, so and again, I haven't really I need to go through that process So anyway, yeah, so but it's it's valuable, but I would tell someone else that they need Yeah, but now i'm sort of doing it myself as well And I've been doing this for a long time.  So I realized that I would have been I wouldn't have had to do it quite so long, had I done some of the things that now I'm doing, if that makes sense.

51:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it makes sense.

51:06 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I feel that intimately.

51:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's where I am. Yeah.

51:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's funny.

51:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Another thing that is not very, and maybe you have seen this as well, because you do so many experts.  I see this a lot, which is in the few conversations. I think I've had like seven, eight, I've talked to a lot of people.  But like with this focus of one more about maybe seven, eight, and one of the things that comes up time and time again is this sense of this person is voraciously curious.  That's how they became an expert. They didn't become an expert because they just like to study. They like to study this thing, right?  And there's an element of lack of discipline to it, because oh, I should be doing something else. I should be learning, I don't know, analytics, but that's  seems boring and I just want to learn about philosophy, right? And it's very common that, and I also feel this intimately, that people have this like, it's a bit of a guilt that, ah, I should have, I should be more structured about this, I kind of, I just wing it, they're not winging it, it's just implicit expertise or unconscious competence, right?  But a tendency of trying to get things from first principles, instead of going into the book. So for some odd reason, I sometimes watch videos on YouTube of people that are really good at shooting competitions.  And one of the things that they say is that it's much easier to teach women how to shoot well with a pistol, because they have less, um, they have less, vices.  They didn't learn the wrong things, right?

52:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  From video games and movies, whole world and like this.

52:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think like there's no way of saying this without coming across as a bit. Anyway, you're probably more clever than most.  That's why you can find your way around this sort of atmosphere business, right? And you'll probably feel very competent in making sense of things and coming up with new territory and it's like, oh, okay, right?  But we live in post metamodernies times and you know that that path you trace in the territory is not exactly that bad, but it works.  It's good enough, right? I've noticed that people that do this and I do this as well, sometimes are like very confident in their ability of creating a path, not so confident that their path is the best.  Because if they do it five times, they find five paths and they're like, how can I trust my gut sometimes?  comes different every time.

53:52 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. And that is interesting. Sorry, I've solved you.

53:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Carry on. No, no, it's because this thing you've mentioned that I am not too structured about it, I think it's probably something that experts and very curious people feel all the time, which is you learn enough to get competent with it, and then you want to learn something else.  And the value is that, the value is knowing a little bit of this thing, a little bit of this thing, a little bit of this thing, and then it became like a cultural broker, right?  But there's a guilt often, I think, of I should have like a PhD in Business Model Canvas, but no, it's just...

54:35 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  That's really interesting. I think it was very recently, I'm not even sure it was earlier today, but suddenly it dawned on me that actually I do know, maybe it's something I heard, but basically the perspective, you know, stuff that I know what it was, it was, you know, my background is recruitment.  Mm-hmm. So somebody contacted me, said, you help, can you find us one of these just help us out? So I did, and I worked late last night doing it, and I found them a brilliant person.  And recruiters have an issue getting, you know, when you've done the job, the company doesn't want to pay very much because they don't really value what you've done necessarily.  Anyway, long story short, it does justify that. The reason why I found a very good person very quickly, because I'm very good at doing what I do, but I'm only very good at doing what I do because I've been doing it for years.  But because of that, because it's easy for me, I then do it, and so. And I also take on board, yes, I mean, there are people that I respect hugely.  You know, if I wanted somebody to come and talk to me about strategy, there are people that I would want in the room to do that.  And they would be the ones. so I judge myself compared to them. I say, well, you need to talk to this guy because my level of knowledge is enough to get them to the point that they need to be, and then we can engage this guy, or I can maybe go and learn a bit more to, I normally get, when I have calls for people, normally, they normally end up with a list of books to read references and stuff to do.  And so I've been doing advisory, but I've never positioned myself as the advisor. So I don't, I don't invoice anything for it, which is not a very good way to pay the bills, but that's the sort of situation.  And I end up introducing to everybody. So anyway, so what I'm doing now is how to capture that value in terms of the relationships.

56:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it makes so much sense. And one of the things, I identify with the feeling that people that work with me tend to judge my abilities higher than I do, right?  say, oh, I really like working with you, you know, yourself. And I'm like, yeah, but there's that guy that does that thing that's Yeah, yeah, and I think in your position like finding experts.  This is There's probably not a lot of people in the world that are in your situation Like your job is to find really competent people at very specific things And you are a curious person that feels like given enough time and effort I could learn that But there's no time there's not enough time to do that So you're constantly facing like oh, was like 30 years of dedication to a specific question Makes that's amazing.  I want that right. I'm assuming if I hope I'm not being too invasive So I've realized that for me The keyword this year was confidence My whole life I think I've been trying to compensate lack of confidence with competence And I think I got it wrong Because as you increase your competence your horizon also increases So the size of your felt incompetence  It's also increased. Yeah. You'll never get out of that. Yes. And I was like, OK, I think I've been playing the wrong game.  should focus on confidence, right? And this has been like question buzzing around my head for the last quarter, I think.  And I'm like, oh, I need to really understand better this game of confidence. Not in a manipulative way, but like Ying Yang, we need a little bit of it, right?  And one of the things that I would like to ask you is, so you have these experts, right? And you help them create content that conveys their expertise.

58:45 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And yeah, yeah, well, they're already experts and they are writing. So you've probably been on the website.

58:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

58:53 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I have this project. So and I've been putting content out for years. I've had probably about 200. 50 authors who have contributed over the years.  More recently, I've just had a few people contributing because I realized that that volume of content is it's not doing me and it's there now, but it's not really doing me selling because I haven't, it's not driving traffic to a point that I can monetize, if that makes sense.  of exploring different ways of doing that. But yes, I mean, so I, what tends to happen is that if somebody were right on article, I'll proof it, put it out, and then I'll help them market it on the tin.  In some cases, we'll have a relationship whereby if they then land a piece of work out of it, then then we get a cut.  But the difficulty there is about attribution. So I can build that and then the work can come through some other routes.  I'm trying to be more purposeful about what specifically I'm doing, which generates value. that means selling to the customer, ultimately, at the end of the day, you need to own the customer.  You need to be providing services to the customer. So that's what I'm really more focused on. now. But helping those consultants get through a tangible outcome, to get a job, we work together to market their services, to get a job.  So I'm trying to help them make it more tangible. If that makes sense. There's some other stuff that I'm working on and I haven't really, I'm formulating at the moment and I will go into more depth of view when that's formulated.  But I think that would be a good conversation to have. Can that make sense?

1:00:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love it. Because what what popped into my mind was, and I am assuming, so the grain of salt is that you've mentioned there's like three, you have the academics, which are the almost bad money that they write in a way that needs to be unlearned.  You have the experience particularly. practitioners, which I would assume they are more kind of in the middle. And you have the good the people that are good and competent but not yet the great at marketing themselves.  I would assume that these three profiles, they have different failure modes, right? They don't have the same struggles. There's like shared struggles, like, oh yeah, like the academics probably take too long because they want to have all the references in the Chicago, MA style, whatever.  And experienced practitioners probably are very opinionated on what works in terms of marketing. And they're good but not great at marketing themselves.  I would assume they just talk about, look at this tool, this is amazing. should use this tool and they don't talk about the job to be done.

1:01:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  All they don't talk about it at all. So they're not really engaging. They just there popping around. They've got their profile on the tin and they rely upon  network to get to market, they're not proactive in marketing themselves. tier one people, the academics, what they're doing is really it'll be research based or they have an authority, therefore their opinion is sought on a global situation.  So for example, one of our authors is guy called Michael Wade, who is a professor at IMD Business School.  So his opinion will be stored, so he'd written a few books on, I'll show you one of his books, this is a book on digital transformation.  So he's on authority on digital transformation, so he's come from research, so he's talking to corporates, he's recognising patterns and he's articulating them in his book, along with Didier Bonnet.  in terms of my position or that, they asked me to endorse that book. So I've built the brand, now I'm endorsing his book.  It doesn't make me an expert, it's good for everybody to go, but it gives me some credibility.

1:03:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:03:06 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Absolutely. But anyway, at that level, and what he's doing is he's sharing good practice, he's building his credibility, he's building his brand, he's building IMD because ultimately they make their money by bringing in executive education students, so he's an authority.  There are others like Rita McGrath, do you know, Rita McGrath? Mm-hmm.

1:03:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, books from her. think. Yeah.

1:03:32 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So, so there are these people up here, and then that knowledge cascades down through people in the field, you know, they're saying the same thing fairly much, or they're facing things on LinkedIn, or sometimes they're writing articles, which can be quite good, but really they're targeting and positioning themselves as an expert.  So I'm not sure how powerful it works as a marketing tool, what it can do is give them some credibility if they're found in another way.  somebody refers to them and they go, this person is really good. they look at the modelling team and they see all the content they've written.  go, they must be really good because they're writing about it. There's an inference about if you write, you're good, but you're not necessarily that good.  I would tend to look at the references of the personal intent. So that's the thing, somebody says that they are a transformation leader.  So they've managed many people and they've done it for years and they've always been great. Then you'd expect to see lots of people talking about how they changed their lives and they did this and they said much.  If that's not there, then it doesn't really stack up in my opinion. I've always looked at references when they're there.

1:04:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Absolutely. And the weird thing is getting the references is also a skill, right?

1:04:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, that's the caveat. You've got to ask for the references. I think if you're really exceptional and people will just give you references, particularly if you've changed people's careers and if you've managed them with something significant in their career, then they want to tell people how great you  you are, but other than people have to ask, or you get reciprocal, I'll write your reference. But there needs to be something, I think.

1:05:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know exactly what to call it, but I've always been intrigued about the intellectual industrial complex, like how does, what's his name, the guy from Gladwell, how does Gladwell become famous?  Malcolm Gladwell?

1:05:32 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, he's written a popular, popular, it's kind of like, so the pop psychology, isn't it? Yeah, it's more like a journalist, right?

1:05:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He's more like a translator, coach, broker, of thing. But what's his name, the worldly slap kind of guy.

1:05:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  don't know, you think people like Simon Sennick, you're talking about, aren't you?

1:05:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Simon becomes from PR, so I think he in the sense this really well. But the point is that Clearly, there's some game that I mean, some people see it, and I think you see it, I don't see it.  I'm not in that position of like, so if you are an academic with an interesting idea and it has, you know, weight, it's solid.  There are ways of taking you from an academic to a known author, speaker, publisher, right? And it seems to be that this is an interaction of several different businesses.  There's personal branding, there's PR, there's ghost writing or editing a book, there's like building the workshop for that guy, you know.  I'm very intrigued with that process of turning. You know exactly what I mean.

1:06:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  But the process of influence in the in the decision process.

1:07:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because to me, it also assumes that there's an aspect that is closer to what you do, which is identifying mispriced or undervalued experts.  So popular experts, it's probably someone that has interesting ideas, knows how to convey them well, and can be coachable, coached in how to do this thing, going to the speaking engagements, and you know, there's a whole network of things that are very specific, and they're not about expertise, they're about this game of being present and in the popular consciousness, right?

1:07:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so some of it's going to be about the YouTube about confidence and confidence and confidence, and some people don't want to be making speeches or have a high profile, but they're competent at what they do, so what they need is a  route to market that gets their skills to be used where they can have value. So yeah, it's different. But at the moment, there's too much talking going on.  And I think there are some very good people who struggle to get to market. And so the thing is to find a way to do that.  So one way to do that is that we take my brand, for example, that's quite known in that space and say, and we become known for access to good people.  And we know the good people so we can fair upon them some status associated with the brand. And we talk to the company say, if you want a good person like this, come and talk to us because we know who they are.

1:08:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's then they don't have to build their own brand.

1:08:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  They're working on the route brand. Like an accreditation that we can give them by association. Or if they write on the site, which a lot of people like to do, then it by association, it says, okay, they must be quite good then.  We're like independent. The other thing is we're not a media business. Sometimes in my struggles about monetization because I'm not a media business.  don't have enough volume traffic to monetize through sponsorship or advertising. So that doesn't really work. So I have to be more, I have to take the brand to the market role and have the market come to me.  And then I don't have that pull. But I have enough credibility to get people to engage with me. So I can get experts to come and sign up and write an article, which gives me some credibility.  But I have to be more proactive about marketing them. That makes sense. helping them productize what they do makes it easier for me to market them.

1:09:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Otherwise, it's much harder. for you to guarantee an outcome, right? mean, they need to do certain things that it doesn't been solely on you.  They're stuff that they need to do on their side.

1:10:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, yeah, yeah. Because I've got a brand and some credibility. Having said all that, I'm thinking about a slightly different brand at the moment, but I will utilize where I come from for this thing that I'm thinking of.

1:10:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I'll tell you about something I've done that maybe there's something interesting in it for you or not. I joined the coaching course because somebody told me that maybe could be interesting for me to know the skills of coaching, although I don't present myself as a coach.

1:10:58 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It was really useful.

1:11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and I've learned a lot of interesting things. And one of the things was that, you know, I got access to a community of people that were in that stage.  Like a lot of them were like what's his name? Somebody calls them corporate refugees. They used to be corporates and then they're like, I'm out, I need to, which is scary, right?  Cause you're outside the reservation and you need to learn new skills and you might feel self-conscious about your ability to the marketing.

1:11:31 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  You don't want your friends in corporate life to judge you and all these things.

1:11:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And one of the things that I was interested at that time was coming up with ways of finding what to talk about.  So I was scratching my own itch. I was like, I know I have ideas but I need to see things to say but I don't create stuff with them.  So for some of them, I ran a little workshop that I was trying to format. That was about Showing them that they had stuff to talk about based on real experiences, right?  And I can if you want I can even you know show you how it looks. Do you have the time?  Yeah, yeah Let me just a second so I know open near Because I think this could be something you do.  Yeah, that people pay for and Because what they get is the transformation and the clarity of what they could be talking about right so Every everything will be in Portuguese because I did this in Portuguese Let's see if I find the vibes.  Yeah, I think this is it Yeah, I'll share my screen now Are you recording the Visual on this as well so we're getting the whole so this is being recorded as well if I share my screen Yeah, actually And I prototype this a couple of times to see  I mean, was doing well and so on. There's two sessions. I called it, simply say it, I don't know.  It starts with the story of their career. So things they studied, things they've done, things that they were very proud of, and things that they did not like to do, right?  We're not talking about content.

1:13:20 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And this is supposed to take 10 minutes.

1:13:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Fun pattern, almost everybody says the roles they've occupied instead of projects they have participated in, but which I think is a short-sighted approach, but then we correct that, right?  And then I asked, what's something that is easy for you to talk about, right? I want to make this really easy to talk about.  And so I give them some hints. So maybe something you've achieved, a person you like, or you admire, ideas that are fascinating to you, even if they're not yours, know?  And the goal you have, you're learning, you know, I wanted to make this really low friction. And so people would have ideas of something to talk about, right?  And then this one was really powerful in terms of like, this always got a reaction. This was a way of forcing people to select between two extremes.  And if you have only four options, there's not the very low option of just saying in the middle, right?  And I'll tell you what are the options. rely only on myself or bring others along. I want to be seen as a rigorous person or I want to be seen as important.  I like to teach or like to share. I like to study or like to experiment. I'm interested in how I apply things or I'm satisfied by progress or I'm satisfied by recognition.  Right. And people have to place these things and eventually they got kind of a way a snake lying around this.  And this led to some sort of reflection of what was important to them. And then what is difficult for them, right?  In the context of online content creation. Here in Brazil, this almost always means Instagram is the most prevalent network.

1:15:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So I asked, I was going to say network, you mean like LinkedIn in Brazil. Is that what you mean or something different?

1:15:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  People in Brazil also use LinkedIn, but the most when they think about social network, they think about Instagram, most people.  Instagram. Instagram.

1:15:47 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah.

1:15:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which I think is not a great network for thought. Yeah. comments are not there. It's very. you get my point.  But it was an interesting data point because these people were still, they had their working identity around corporates, and then they had not yet put on the independent consultant working identity.  So they were in the middle, they were civilians, so to say. And a Brazilian civilian, when he thinks about the social network, will think about Instagram or TikTok.  And they were not thinking about the job to be done on that network. Anyway, So I gave some hints of things that could be difficult for them.  And a lot of people mentioned that they were fearful of being judged by old colleagues. They felt discouraged by the algorithm that doesn't show their stuff to anyone.  They feel like an imposter writing about things that they question if they really know. These were common things. And then finally, this was the end of the first session.  Finally, are you familiar with the book the tower and the square no so i'm going to do that thing i'm not familiar with the book either i've just heard of it i've not read right but basically what the book talks about is a book i think it's like from 12 years ago and it talks about social networks and a tower is broadcast yeah analogy and a square is a you know exchange thing right and i was asking them what about the library that's another sort of construction right and the library to me it evokes feelings of you are studying something you are serious about it and there's there's other people there but you are probably working alone right and the idea was to get them to understand what's the archetype that most appeals to them right yeah so the tower is to have a huge audience and you talk to a lot of people and that  difficult part of the tower is difficult to build a tower. You'll need to work for the algorithm. You need to do all these things that you might not like.  The advantage of the tower is that it's really motivating when you pick up speed. So you talk, you can just share an idea and you get input and feedback on it.  The square is for more social people, like they create a community, want to be connecting other people and being part of the conversation.  You've kind of shaped the conversation but there's a more emergent aspect. The library is more about you are really interested in your thing and you probably have something that others are not seeing because you're not showing.  The difficult side of the library is that it takes a long time to grow and it could be discouraged before you get any traction.  But the interesting thing is that the outcomes of working in a library-like fashion is that you have this kind of solid knowledge, like case studies, have your concepts and your ideas, and there's a different gravitas to it, right?  And at the end, they had some homework, right? And the homework was to make tree lists of tree topics that they could talk about, right?  They already had some topics before, right, over here, but the idea is each step is really small, so it's easy to take, and I collected some feedback on the workshop, which is also something good about workshops, because you can just do it in the workshop and helps with the concept.  Then I went to the second session, right? The second session does a little bit of a recap, so there's themes and topics you can talk about.  There's a place where you can, where you want to reach. There are some obstacles in your way, like, oh, I don't like writing, or I have no consistency or stuff like that.  And there's your square tower library kind of archetype, which is the way you appear online, the way you went with your online.  And now we want to convert those three topics that were the homework. We want to convert them into posts, okay?  if you were, let's say you were going through this and one of the topics was recruiting. You probably would not put just recruiting, you'll probably go deeper on that, but a lot of people would write stuff like that, a bit generic.  So now let's break this down into a more granular approach into it, because you don't want to write the magnum opus of recruiting.  That's a lifetime thing, it's not a post on LinkedIn, right? You need to just type your stuff. at this part,  of the session, what I'm trying to do is to show them that there are many ways of showing or talking about something, okay.  And this is more akin to those content creation frameworks from Justin Welch and that kind of people. So there's the depth of the post, you can go deep, you can go shallow, you can focus on what the level of awareness your audience already has.  So if they don't know about it, if they know a lot about it, if you define this at the end, it will make a difference in how you create.

1:21:35 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Types of post, is it actionable?

1:21:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it instructions? Is it about present in the future? Is it more motivational? is less about long form, right? Is this an observation?  Is this a change of perspective anyway? And then you think about channels and then you think about the media aspects of it, right?  So this slide was not an activity, this was not an interactive. And then based on this information they got, we do a second round of unfolding their themes into the posts, and we leave the cheat sheet here.  And this was the end. this was not the first iteration of this workshop. My first iterations were very ambitious, and people would never finish the workshop, and they had a lot of surface level ideas for posts.  But then I started to tighten it up. And at the end, we have like this motivational aspect, which is you have, this is a survival kit.  You have everything you need. So you have clear sources of what to do. Your themes, the way you present online, your ideas for posts.  have sources of trust, which is your history. All of these things you're talking about, these are things that are, they come from.  from you in one way or another, right? You know how you will sidestep the and you have dedicated time to think about this.  All of these things build up your trust, right? You have sources of courage, of courage. You have your motives and your objectives, and you are already aware of what kind of challenges you will face.  I am of the philosophy that if you know what's difficult about something, it's much easier when that thing becomes difficult, so that's kind of the approach.  And then we want to take this further. More clarity. want the participant to pick a format and a channel where they will create 10 posts for instance.  More trust, you will need to create like a spreadsheet or a list of ideas for posts that will grow with time, and then you will see, oh my God, I've written like five, I've written 10, I've written 50, is great, And more sources of courage, like somebody that will be on your corner, a wife, a husband,  the sun, that, you know, believes in them, right? So that there's some homework, and basically the homework is to, you know, rush them into mark time in their agenda to create one, to post one post, not to do the post, to post the post, just to force them to time box this thing and not to take, not to take forever.  Yeah. I collect feedback again. And finally, I really like this thing. Okay. There's a bingo. What I like about the bingo is that as an expert, you can use a bingo to show that you have a lot of pattern recognition, but you're not committed to the sequence of the things.  So let me just give you an example. And they should mark things that they are familiar to them, right?  So I've created something, but I don't have the guts to post it. A lot of people have felt this, right?  I was talking to someone, and the opportunity came up for me to send a link, to something I've done, and this also happens sometimes, which is very validating, like, oh, I'm glad I wrote it down.  Now I have something to show, right? I've created the plan to be consistent about this, but at the end, I only make things at the last minute, right?  And so there's all these sort of situations in the first person, and the idea behind it is to make them feel like, look, you are not a failure, this thing is difficult, and a lot of people go through the thing you're going through.  And even if they don't get many of them, if they just find one or two, they're like, okay, so this guy, he gets me, right?  And for me, this is more like an encouraging a source of courage, and that's it. So I think this sort of thing makes sense to you, if you're working with people that create content and you, anyway, I would to hear your thoughts.  I thought just.

1:26:01 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  No no no no no I apologize at all thank you for sharing it. It's interesting, so this is a workshop you ran to take people through how they might create their own sort of online presence through using content.

1:26:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah and I don't think it's a great system if the person is trying to play that's you know hyper growth game but the people me and you've shown me that I have things that I can talk about and I can feel confident about them.  So that's the most consistent feedback on that.

1:26:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  That's good. That's really good.

1:26:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that was good to hear. But I'm showing you, you're showing it is not not too, you know, I could correct my thing.  just, I feel this is something along the lines of something that you do with with the people that you have up skill.  Yeah, yes, yes.

1:27:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  No, what I tend to do is they're either writing already or they or they're aspiring to do what I'm what I will do is I will proof and I'll put it on the website and then we'll put it out on LinkedIn.  There isn't a lot of structure around it and that's partly because, strategically, I haven't, it used to be like a machine, basically, we had hundreds of authors and we were pumping content out all over LinkedIn.  had multiple channels on LinkedIn. So when I started Disregression People, we had we created channels for every aspect. So we had, you know, cybersecurity, we had strategy and innovation, lots of different sort of subcategories of digital transformation and we were pumping out content all over Twitter and on LinkedIn, but targeting those specific things.  But it was too broad. So I'm not. really doing that at the moment. What I'm doing is I think the content needs to be more purposeful in the sense that, you know, why are you doing it and what do you want people to do when they, you know, so I've eased off a bit as far as content concerned.  I have been curating content from my personal brand perspective, so I haven't used that, which is really just curated content.  It's mainly stuff that I find interest. So I'm probably a bit guilty of some of the stuff that I find interesting.  I share it because I find it interesting. It's not necessarily, I'm not trying to sell anything because I haven't figured out what I was trying to sell.  So I've just kept the brand, I was spinning a plate, kind of keep it all going while I figure out what to do with it.  so, where I am at the moment is, I'm now, I think I'm getting there in terms of what the direction it will be.  there's a sort of potentially a new proposition. There's more about collaboration with certain people to get them to market and there's maybe some collaborations around actually doing recruitment.  that will fund, the recruitment bit of fund. But I'm more, where I'm at really is probably more, more start-up-y thing.  I've been searching for a problem. And I think early on I built a big solution and I was trying to figure out where to point the solutions.  That makes sense?

1:29:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So that's where I'm at at the moment.

1:29:35 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So the content, whilst it's there, hasn't been as purposeful as it should be. But there's lots of it and I've still got the brand and people want to write on the site.  So we'll keep that going. But I'm going to make it more purposeful around proposition as I kind of do the proposition.  You'll see if you look at the newsletter, the sort of stuff that's published. It's quite good. I'm not really asking for anything very much in terms of my ask.  You know, it's interesting, I got this recruitment requirement in yesterday just by virtue of the fact that I had a conversation with somebody and he's just not, I wasn't selling.  I was just talking to him and then I said, and that's what I used to do. This is what I'm now doing.  And then he just came back selling and came up with this. So that's good. So it's different. In fact, one thing I have learnt recently is that storytelling is more powerful than selling.  People engage with people who will tell a story. And that's why the content that you publish on LinkedIn and stuff, the more authentic it is with you and they'll engage with you as an individual.  So then they need to know what's your ask. So here's somebody I like and respect and here's some great content that I'm engaging with.  And they do this. So the influencers do well. They're writing about what they do and why that's so good.  Everybody switches off. No one's interested.

1:30:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that's very difficult, especially if you grew up in the media environment. where it was one too many and everything was published.  Yeah. So I've noticed that like my cousins, I'm 37 going on 38. And my cousins which are like 15, they really see that digital is impermanent, right?  it doesn't matter if you just say anything. Really? Yeah, they just say stuff. they are not, they are not, but the thing is that they do not believe stuff on the Internet either.  Because they know like, oh, I can say crap. Obviously that guy could say crap. And I've noticed that you remember a life before the Internet and there's a moment that the Internet comes.  Internet is a place you go to at a certain time, maybe at night because dial-up was cheaper. I remember that too.  So look like my formative media years were based on television, right? And television is polished. And there's this idea that everybody looks good.  And I think a lot of... that failure mode from people trying to start to participate in the online conversation and beginning by getting headshots or branding studio time or building a beautiful website comes from that world, which is a world that is less iterative, right?  Because television is not iterative. cycle is really long. I think that's a difficult thing. And I mean, I've made this mistake.  Like, I've been thinking about, should I have a brand? Should I beam at the brand? And honestly, I think I do not need a brand, but I symbolically, it was important to me to have like, I'm sorry to go and say, okay, my company started.  I got no. So I'm sorry, you just, you inspired me with the Well, I'm thinking about the brand situation.

1:32:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So you are fairly much your branding is probably a bit similar to someone like Nick Kimmovich. So he is the innovation guy.  That's how he positions himself. It's him rather than his company. And you're the workshop guy. Yeah, and that's your brand.  a personal brand. It depends what you're trying to do. What's your ambition? That's why I asked you about your ambition.  What do you want to build?

1:33:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so Honestly, I just want to work on cool projects and cool projects for me. Usually I need a section of those things, right?  Yeah, and But for me, like I came up for I'm gonna give you an example my the brand I've created.  It's called Mysos like like Yeah, I'm sorry dinosaurs. Yes.

1:33:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I mean, it's not an easy name.

1:33:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It doesn't convey much It's kind of mysterious. I've had people ask me like who I what's that? But to be honest, it's like me just saying you know what I can call it anything I want and I'm I want to call it Mysos like so it's probably not a very cool  working name. It's not a very smart brand. But I think I needed it more from like an internal journey, like, Oh, I am a business.  I'm not just a guy  around on the internet, right? Oh, and okay. So I need, and I think I was aware of it as I was doing it, like, oh, I need this, a steak on the ground that says it begins as a company, you know, because when I didn't do that, and I was just like independent consultants, I was like, what do you do?  Oh, what's the problem? I can help with a lot of things. No. And the brand thing was a forcing function for me.

1:34:39 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:34:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because it reduces the speed that we check and change my positioning. Because if you don't have a brand that can just change every day, there's a brand.  mean, you cannot change every day. And I think increasing that distance between, Oh, my God, I think I'm this and changing my materials.  In this space, a lot of. battling happens and you're like, okay, maybe I'm the same thing, I just have one thing that I change in the way I don't.

1:35:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, no, your website is good. And you're talking about specific pain points and what you do to solve them.  It's good. It's intriguing. You haven't spent a lot of time making it look sophisticated, but you don't need to because the messaging is there.  It's like a holding space that says, this is what we do. You do it up on LinkedIn. It's polished enough and you've got the sub stack as well, which is good.  So thank you. Yes. So I mean, my impression of you is this guy knows what he's talking about, but then I heard the sub stack and it was really good.  Not the sub stack, sorry. The podcast. podcast. Yeah, so it was good. So in terms of your personal branding, you're obviously doing a good job.  And so the thing for you is, again, you're the workshop guy by Meg.

1:36:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  whatever guy.

1:36:03 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Another person to look at for you would be Alex Smith.

1:36:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Alex Smith, the strategy guy. Yeah, he's good.

1:36:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  No  strategy. So he's developed a certain way of articulating what he does. So he's slightly irreverent and it's true in many cases.  And I've noticed, I've seen people kind of trying to copy him, but he's got a lead on it. It's a good book.  It's a goodness. I have it somewhere.

1:36:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  haven't read it yet. It's on a box somewhere. I've moved the buttons. It's worth reading.

1:36:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I mean, there's lots of good books and strategies. Do you know guy called Roger Martin?

1:36:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yes. Where to play how to win?

1:36:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So he's got a medium thing he is really good. Probably more corporate, whereas Alex Smith is more kind of, you know,  it, try it, kind of thing.

1:37:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I remember it so recently, but it all makes sense.

1:37:10 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  There are a few other books like that as well. mean, principally what they're really positioned, what they're talking about has been different.  Yeah. do you position? How are you unique? How are you actually creating value? are you saying no to so that you're saying yes to something which you've done?  So you're saying, I've said no to this because I'm about workshops. So you found your niche and they are digging into that niche.  And that's fine. That's good. That's good thing. So strategically, you're doing a good thing, I think. Oh, thank you.

1:37:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's really reassuring to hear especially because you have so much contact with people going through this. Sometimes you don't know, right?  The things that you are working, there is a liking indicator. So that's great. Yeah, know, Alex, it took this content course, the unignorable course.

1:37:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And I got the same course, I didn't finish it.

1:37:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was not really a course. was more like a challenge. Yeah, are you familiar with this this brother is not his course is of course he did or because he he took it took this course He went through it to learn how to write for LinkedIn.  I did it.

1:38:14 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay.

1:38:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, and I'm I can find it here for you at the time I got it because I felt for the FOMO of This comes price if you use Alex need on check out Okay So I didn't finish the course and I think mostly for my own reasons.  I think it is good This is the course and A lot of it is around hooks and like psychology and getting attention from people, right?  It's called unignorable. It's not about long form is But it's it's interesting in terms of like this new game of capturing attention I Got some useful stuff out of it  Of course, like the people that really blew up they follow it to a T and then they have taste and then they are wheat and, you know They have everything.

1:39:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so Okay, so you get what I've been interested in then is is how We do you have any examples of?  Maybe a consultant you've taken from this is how they looked and now this is how the workshop looks To some area.

1:39:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, have I have like a because in terms of show don't tell right No, I have stories I can tell you, but I don't have one many assets in terms of visuals Okay, which is a shame and goes against my brand.  Anyway cover son and all that Um Do you have okay, so that's the answer.

1:39:54 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  okay I'm thinking about how can we I'd be interested in how? how we can explore this topic together and the outcome for you would be that there will be people that would like to work with you to productize what they're doing.  There will be some people who have already done that, but maybe you could refine it working with you. there's going to be your value add in terms of the structure.  You'll have proof points around what does and what doesn't work as far as workshops are concerned. So you learn that.  So there's a thing. Liberating structures, I think you mentioned, you've encapsulated some of that. So your IP, your knowledge, and you've come up with a process that you take people through now where the outcome is that they go from here, where they're not really clear on what they do, to now they have clarity, to now they have a workshop that can get them in the business.  That's what they do. So it'll be interesting to see you do I'm going begin to learn what works in winning consultancy business around workshops.  And then maybe people that you could talk to that are doing it and are successful or some people who are doing it but would like to be more successful, potentially I could, if we had some sort of workshop, like you get some people in a room that maybe use workshops but they struggle with this and you could give advice or you maybe get some clients that way, but also raise awareness of workshops being a thing that create value.  But your monetising is getting these people to mark, it's helping them do it isn't it, it's helping them up to kill themselves.  I'm sure there are people that in my network that we are working with that we could then say all about have you considered workshops or do you do workshops and have you talked about you talk to y'all?  Is that transition y'all?

1:41:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it a difficult name because of the filter? Joelle.

1:42:01 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Joelle.

1:42:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joelle.

1:42:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's like Jew.

1:42:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then wow, Jew well. Jew well, okay.

1:42:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. Joelle. yeah, so I think that we could, that's something that we could, we could do. But there's other stuff I want to talk to you about, but I need to formulate it a bit more at the moment.  But yeah, I think there's some other stuff that we could potentially do as well. Yeah.

1:42:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I can see different ways of us doing this. I'm for, we create a group session, master class, something like that for your community, something like that could work.  I've done something like that in the past, but it was like a year ago, I think my material is tighter now, so it's better.  There's also, I mean, if you want, I can I can also give you some feedback. like on some stuff, if you feel comfortable with that.  But definitely the master class, mean, you can count me in, I can do it. You'd like to see that, OK.

1:43:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I can also look at your sub-stack. Maybe one way of finding people is to promote your services, and we can talk about the role of workshops in digital transformation.  And maybe what you've seen or we will, between which we can come up with something that gives you something tangible to put out there to it.  So, I mean, this is all kind of a little esoteric at the moment, but you see how it's sort of converging.  I do, I do.

1:43:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just reminded me that I think I have something written that maybe it's, I don't know how much you've explored the sub-stack, because I mean, we are all busy, there's so much things to do.  But maybe there's a post that I've done that connects with something that you do. Yeah. found it. One of my earlier ones.  Because, oh, fantastic, strategic design consulting.

1:44:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  How I sell strategic design consulting, depends what strategic design consulting.

1:44:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, absolutely. But the point that I've realized later that I was hinting at was making it tangible.

1:44:25 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yep.

1:44:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And, yeah, maybe we'll find this interesting. I think we share a lot of perspectives. I'm confident that we can find something that we can collaborate, more time together, share more ideas, more book recommendations, be useful for both.  I mean, I love this conversation. We went over time and that was fine. Yeah, yeah, It's good.

1:44:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It is good. but I think this is a convergence in terms of where we're going. So, I Yeah, so definitely.  So we can carry on. So I'll do this up. Let's keep on communicating their via links in and we can set up other calls and things.  I will also, there are some insights that would be good to share. says that you're prioritizing or codifying what you're doing.  Some of the people who are doing workshops, there will be gaps in the sense that they'll go, Oh, hadn't thought of that, you know, that maybe you could talk to each other.  There might be something for you learning for you in terms of how they perceive it. I mean, your challenge is going to be to market yourself, the extent that you're getting a steady flow of people you can work with to build your portfolio and your testimonials, really, that this thing that you want to be doing.  So, so I think there'll be people that I can say that I can we can make aware of of you to do that.  And then we can we can look at then how do we utilize the outputs of you working with them to land them opportunities.

1:46:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know when you get a little bit antsy and you struggle with staying sitting down, you need to walk around the house because your mind is bubbling.  So that's how I feel right now.

1:46:19 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. All right. So, well, in that case, then we can resume the conversation. Just let me know if you get to a point or you want to talk again.  Then let's do that.

1:46:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I just wrote some stuff that I wanted to share with you. Yeah. Are you familiar with Sean Johnson from Madison?

1:46:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Sean Johnson. I like his approach.

1:46:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me find him on LinkedIn.

1:46:46 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  He's from where? It's called Madison. Madison. Yeah.

1:46:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I found this profile and I'll just send it to you. Where are you? Here. He's got. I think it's an interesting approach to consulting, and he also talks about frameworks, he has a very human angle to this sort of work, but I think it's very interesting.  So there was something else. Oh, there's another person that I think it's really interesting in terms of how they have packaged their IP.  Oh, well, okay. I'm opening it here. It's called Object Oriented UX, and they have certifications and things, and I'm really interested about the meta game of this.  I have not spoken to this person, she's a woman. I think she's Canadian, I'm not sure. She was really like, oh, this person gets it.
  ACTION ITEM: Send Tim link to meeting recording - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/spsuuLZJutDRL8vsdqY6eqZ7h61GEyvc?timestamp=6476.9999  Yeah, she was signaling that she gets it. anything else? No, I don't think so. This is one of the things I wanted to share with you.

1:48:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, so I will look at all that. Would you send me a link to the recording so I can go back?  Yeah, yeah. I probably won't listen to all of it, but I might think through it. No, it's very interesting.  I think it's a good thing to pursue.

1:48:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I believe the same. It is very encouraging. And yeah, I'm genuinely excited. I'll be in Portugal in a while for around Christmas time, so we'll be closer to the same time zone.  Okay. Yeah, so what's going to be you there now then? Right now is 25 past one. Almost half past one.  Lunchtime? Lunchtime, yes. Oh, you're not up in the night.

1:48:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. Well, I've got you here. I'm going to find You're looking at your calendar correct now.

1:49:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  looking I'm looking at my phone Arthur it's Arthur Verikai My cousin his name is Arthur Verikai V-E-R-O-C-A-I Oh, I think it's famous yet as I wrote V-E and the way it appears very okay.  Yeah.

1:49:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. I'm messing for the first time Earlier this year So yeah, I had no idea of such a big star We went to the concert that he was doing in London.  It's not the whole place went mad and then everyone was chanting his name Just anyway, so that was quite fun that he's he's big in Brazil.

1:49:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Apparently he felt recently at the start of September he fell he fell during a show. Oh, it? It's fine it's just that  It's pretty old.

1:50:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  We're in Priscilla, you're based.

1:50:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The south, so it's 400 kilometers south of São Paulo. Right. It's called Critiva. Sorry. Sorry, we wouldn't be with the BRA.  mean, real to person.

1:50:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Critiva. Okay. All right.

1:50:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And where are you? I mean, I know he's the okay, but.

1:50:32 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Uh, it depends how well, know, I'm about 40 minutes by train outside London, North. I'm in place called Burke Hempstead.  It's kind of, it's a market town. Um, I'll show you what I don't.

1:50:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so funny to how naturally it becomes very beautiful. just canals?

1:51:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, canals and woods and stuff. Yeah, it's a nice place. Beautiful.

1:51:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:51:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Now, I think what you're going to say is how amazing it is that we can talk to each other like this.  You're in Brazil and I'm in the UK.

1:51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It becomes so natural because yesterday I spoke to somebody in the UK, a person in Australia and again in the United States and it was just normal and we get used to this.  then you talk to a friend that works in something else and you're like, what the hell? It's a fine personality.  It's really nice. And then I see like how it looks like the CEO of that person and oh, it reminds me of something.  Yeah, it's a really good thing.

1:51:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And actually that's the question I didn't ask you. It's about workshops, the extent to which they are delivered remotely.  What's your feeling on that?

1:51:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm focusing more on remotely because it's also easier for me to talk about them. But the dynamics are The mechanics are the same, dynamics are not the same, and it's doable, but I don't think it's an easy sell for me, online guy to sell live workshops.  think people might, you know, have questions about that. But I have done, most workshops I've done, I think they have been, you know, physical space, and then you have to bring a lot of machinery.  I was just, know, diving up, have boxes of post-its and workshop props for different things. So it's funny, our house starts to look like kindergarten sometimes, all the gold, full paper, rubber bands and whatever.  Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1:52:42 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Are you familiar with strategy tools?

1:52:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is that a specific product?

1:52:50 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's a suite of products, but they are very much about simulation and, and, and, sort of simulated learning environments.  Oh, this is it.

1:53:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was not familiar with that, and I am now doing a project exactly on this. So this is actually timely.  Okay, so check them out.

1:53:14 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So the guy who runs it, got called Christian Rangan.

1:53:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll spend some time on this thing. This looks incredibly timely. Are you familiar with that guy?

1:53:29 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, and Scott Newton is somebody that you need to get to know. They are the two principal people at, but basically simulation.  So what they're doing is they're delivering effectively simulated learning, you know, simulated learning things. So I don't I would call it the training environments.

1:53:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  have like some workshop. elements to it. Right, okay, okay.

1:54:04 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So, yeah. Anyway, so there's loads of, that Scott Newton is a very good guy to follow, very influential, writes a lot about strategy.

1:54:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love coming away from these conversations with a little bit of homework, it's always a good sign. Yeah, I added him.  Thinking dimensions in this company, right? Yeah, yeah.

1:54:36 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And in Italy, I mean, this guy is doing something right. His Canadian, he lives in Italy and he travels all over the world.  He's been everywhere. He knows about every industry. He's very, very nice guy and very knowledgeable. But he is a principal at strategy tools as well.  And strategy tools has a global network of consultants who are basically, they've been trained up as coaches in the strategy tools way of doing things.  So they become master coaches, and then they go and present the simulations to customers. So they're doing the selling, and they're doing the presenting, but strategy tools are only IP.

1:55:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. Yeah. I I'm struggling not to just get the last know the tabs I have now, because I want to be in this conversation, but okay, thank you.  This is good.

1:55:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So check them out, and then we can, yeah, just let me know if you have any questions, and let's resume, I'm happy to talk whenever you want.

1:55:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Absolutely. Is there any specific date or thing you have already scheduled that would be helpful for you if we talk before that?

1:55:57 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It depends. I'm... And where we are on things, like I said, I'm formulating stuff at the moment. There's people I'm talking to, I'm just being a bit candid at the moment, aren't I?  But no, no, no, this is not really, no, no, are you thinking, like right now, I am.

1:56:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I asked because I wanted to find a way of being helpful that connects with what you actually need.  But I understand what you're talking about. And the stage I am at right now is that I am, you know, formulating my own entry product.
  ACTION ITEM: Send Tim draft materials on entry product for optional feedback - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/spsuuLZJutDRL8vsdqY6eqZ7h61GEyvc?timestamp=6994.9999  And I might, if you're okay with that, I might send you some stuff. And if you want to send me feedback, you can, but it's not homework, it's not, know, it's appreciated but not necessarily expected.  And yeah, so I was asking because maybe there was something you would say, Oh, I have something coming up and I would like to have feedback on this before that.  And if I could, I would try to.

1:57:10 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Oh, okay.

1:57:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, there may be questions that I forgot about stuff up.

1:57:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So if we keep communicating and then if we get to the point, we'll just have a conversation. If there's anything I need to look at as far as workshops and concerns, get myself skilled up.  But yeah, there will be lots of things that I kind of probably need to ask you. And where I'm at at the moment is that I need to validate some ideas.  And what I'm probably thinking of doing is that where I'm at is it'll probably be a startup type situation.  So and I'm talking to some people that can help us do that to put a team together and then to go and get some funding.
  ACTION ITEM: Check out Asia Orangio's book on productization - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/spsuuLZJutDRL8vsdqY6eqZ7h61GEyvc?timestamp=7071.9999  That's what I'm thinking of at the moment. So that and again is pretty esoteric, but it's that's where I'm at.

1:58:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm strong productize the book no, I haven't you will love this book because this book is not about workshops.  Okay. What's name? Asia. I'm strong. I think it's me. I'm not sure. She went on Professor Joe's podcast and I can find the book.  Basically, the book is called productize is about our service companies can productize. And she has like this scale for this ladder, this four step ladder, right?  at the very low level is my services, which everybody starts there. And at the other end, you have like recurring revenue, probably software as a service based on your domain expertise.

1:58:53 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Perfect. I will check that out. There's a book that you might be interested in as well. going to just bounce it off you.  It's about I haven't finished reading it yet. I've just bought it. I didn't finish this one either. Once you get into a book, you can fairly quickly get the general thing.  It's called the consulting bible from a wife.

1:59:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's Alan Weiss.

1:59:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I've just started that. He seems really switched on, but from your perspective, in terms of creating a product which is helping these guys.  That will help you understand the context of the people that you're selling to.

1:59:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't think about it in that way, but that makes a lot of sense. I mean, I can do customer discovery just by reading what they are reading, right?

2:00:06 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, to some extent, that's provided they are actually reading it and they believe it, but by proxy. Yeah, yeah, no, but I think it's an interesting, interesting thing and it's kind of it's funny actually, one of the things that I I didn't like about recruitment is that it's so commoditized.  It's really just a sales job, but the more I try and do other things, the more I realize everything else is a sales job anyway, everything is a sales job.  So, yeah, that's where I got to. What I'm interested in really doing is creating a product or a service where it has value.  It'll sell itself if you can get in front of the right people. You know, you've got to find the right thing.

  Anyway, yeah, I'm just finding something else to send you because I think you would appreciate this We got into that stage of the conversation, right?  Sharing excitingly sharing things that we've liked and think of the other will yeah Tom Crichelo is British Relieves in the US and he writes about independent consulting.  Yeah, are you familiar? I really like his stuff.

2:01:25 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I Don't know him so independent consulting Yes, I mean ironically enough.

2:01:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It just stopped being an independent consultant, but it was for like nine years and it talks a lot about Like The meta game the internal Journey, you know all these things that are not just about it's about like finding our own work in identity It's a bit more esoteric, but I think it's interesting.  I haven't read all of it I just read some stuff, but I think I might find this. Yeah, okay.
