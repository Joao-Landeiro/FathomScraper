  and stay. Really? It's been a very intense period in general.

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it leaning towards the good side of intense or more complicated? nice.

0:12 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  100%, 110% good. Nice.

0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Always need to start cautious in case there was something less than nice. That's great news. It's been a while, right?

0:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, I've just been, I was in Manchester last week doing a workshop for a client in London filming, now Portugal.  I've been in however, Airbnb and hotels in the last six weeks. Overall, it's been a pretty intense and hectic period.  No problem.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're here now. Okay, so I sent you the link for the mirror.

0:53 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Just looking for a quiet spot to... Oh, perfect.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll give you call.

0:58 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, sure.

0:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we can talk.

1:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm just working around with a cup of tea, which makes it a bit trickly to set an OpenAmirror board.  I've been thinking a lot about the ICP. Yes, I saw that you shared some stuff on LinkedIn.

1:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me open that again. The image. The image. when you are.

1:52 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I've been doing a lot of thinking about the ICP IBP.

1:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was talking to Liam about it quite extensively.

2:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And we decided to get my card so I can't exit back to the desk. Oh, I think I lost you.  Oh.

2:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're still there, yeah?

2:20 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Just no video. Yes. OK, so I'll just continue talking and hope that you're still there.

2:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, great.

2:33 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I was talking to Liam. And the problem, the challenge we have is the... I'm posting on LinkedIn. It's obviously a large cost to do the videos.  And that generates prospects. And, you know, I've got three speaking events coming. One of them is to Ring Fest, which is pretty big.  So... excited, an exciting period in terms of opportunity. so the video stuff works, right? And that's good. The problem is, when I do PS sign up to my newsletter, which is meant to be the primary nurturing mechanism for generating prospects, it's a trickle.  It's like well, I got 100 subscribers in the last two months or something. And then we launched the intro which is a six part email series, which is meant to lead into a paid call.  And I've only had like three or four people sign up to the intro series, and none of them are ICP.  So this resulted in this conversation, is like, okay, we're putting all this cost and effort into content production on the blog in the newsletter, but very, very few people are reading it.  There's no way I'm going to get ROI, so I can't continue to work with Liam to produce this content when no one's reading it.  he was like, should we focus our effort on producing LinkedIn content that we repurpose into the blog post? So rather than blog post that's deep and long and complex, we post it frequently, but we have a focus on producing content that kind of starts to take us more into flesh territory, know, visuals and carousels and stuff like that that complements the video to take us into this, take us into essentially more reach, but ideally more people signing up to the newsletter.  because they go through the intro series and that's the kind of current hypothesis. So, you know, like a big push to create the intro series, launch the intro series, the uptake has been subpar.  So when I jumped on the call with Liam, I like, okay, what are we gonna work on? I was like, well, I don't wanna stop producing content for the sake of creating content.  I wanna create content that leads to an offer or leads to a service. Okay, we were thinking about the further service and we're like, well, I've got my intro offer.  But what if we did some pieces of content to promote the workshop? Because you know, obviously invested in creating the workshop together.  And then we started talking about ICP-IDP and he's like, this is actually really interesting. And at one point during the call, he was like, I would actually pay you to help.  with this. It's a problem that I even I relate to here. And we ended up deciding that we agree that it's likely going to be a paid workshop but not a highly priced one.  And we're debating about the price and who it attracts that there's other ACP but I think I'm kind of in this, I'm trapped between high price point consultant and influencer.  So I've got the following on LinkedIn that can influence with us and I create that. But my monetization is actually high touch low volume strategic retainers.  So I'm really a strange hybrid and I'm kind of, you know, I'm doing well on the strategic retainers. need one more client and I'm good.  I've reached a level of comfort, not capacity, but I'm like, I'm doing quite well to reach capacity and be stretched thin.  But I really double down where I'm just climb work. I probably need to get to seven clients. I'm on four.  So if I get one more, comfortable. If I get three more, I'm like, So new whole prospect, literally, two weeks later.  So I'm not too worried about growth and opportunity, especially now with the speaking events, the consistent growth of my LinkedIn profile, like I'm optimistic.  So then I was like, okay, there's a lower priced workshop. And then what we were talking is like, should I make it free?  I'm like, I just don't have the capacity. I'm not looking to have more potential conversations with people to try and convert them.  I just need to figure out more ways to monetize rather than have a lead in to. And if you ask me why, I think it's because I produce so much content and the quality of the content is very good.  And that's generating enough prospects that right now I don't need to do that. Now, if I didn't have enough prospects, I would absolutely make it free.  And essentially now, even if I close one more client, just to give you a sense, last month I closed 4K on top of my baseline.  And that was too hard. shops at 2.3k each to one to an existing client. I'm on to a new client, 20 million are our business.  And this month, I've closed 4k again, but not from workshop, from brand sponsorship deals, which is quite funny. So hopefully next month, I'll be able to do 4k and 4k, and that would be amazing.  So I'm just essentially, I'm kind of in a point where I'm not, I'm time poor and energy poor, but not client opportunity poor.  So for me, I'm now interested in like layering on more ways to monetize and grow. And I don't have a low value, low ticket item.  And I see the workshop as being more of a massive volume. Let's say mass, mean like 15, 20 people, right?  mean like 500. But I mean pricing at probably like $350, right? Pardon enough, ICP-IBP, I started going really deep into it with one of my clients, like really helping them map it out.  You know, it me plus the head of marketing, head of sales. CEO on a call. It's kind of interesting to go deep into seeing it and doing it and mapping it out and kind of really leaving and reading it on a specific client.  So that's pretty cool. That's happened since our last call. That's it. I have a ton of resources I haven't read and figured out and added to the synthesis, I do have a couple of assets that I created on ICP-IBP for the client workshop I ran.  So I did do ICP-IBP for two clients. One is I did this client mapping the work with them and the second I've got two assets, well it's one asset, an Excel file with two sheets, ICP and IBP.  That is a criteria. So I've got two assets I've created since we last talked, ICP-IBP, which we can use in the workshop as well.  And that's it. That's where I'm at. Congratulations.

10:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's the first thing. A couple of things here, I have some questions. So first, you've mentioned, I don't know how relevant this is, so if it isn't much relevant just we can just keep it.  Do you know why those two clients ended up closing with other consultants and not you? I think so.

11:28 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think, I think, I sent them the proposal in a Loom video and I should have presented the proposal to them.  So as my sales coach's hypothesis and he's like, this is not the time the way. So he said I should have presented the proposal.  I just didn't want to go through the proposal where I'm talking through, talking out. Presentation but really what I needed to do is not make your presentation making it like just that full of pages or slides and It kept it simpler but really aligned with them and have a conversation around that Okay, rather than just send a loom video which is easier to do Because it gives me time to prep and that it would go through the deck, but it's quite annoying You know I spent a good Two hours plus prep time on two videos.  spent the two and a half hours in each prospectus five hours I'm never getting so it's very frustrating I'm now not going to do that anymore But yeah It is what it is.  But yeah, I don't I think I think it was maybe also price. I think the price may have been punchy And it also could be that I went in with a high price when they should have gone in  like a lower tier offer, build a relationship and dynamic and then upsell them to a higher price point. Maybe that was a mistake as well.  Okay, thank you. Another question.

13:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You've mentioned that you were thinking about pricing the workshop as $350? Yeah.

13:31 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay.

13:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tell me more about that number.

13:37 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So when we were talking about it, Liam said, know, I'd pay $350 for this, but not $500. And then I was like, well, if I charge more, it's indicating that it's for a larger company, a larger ICP.  But then I don't think of this as like an entry point for larger, more established businesses. because then probably not really struggling with ICP-IBP.  The idea of struggling with ICP-IBP is likely to be in businesses that are sub-5mm ARR, and a sub-5mm ARR business probably isn't going to pay a large amount of money.  They're not going to pay a thousand pounds for a workshop, probably, unless I was like the expert on this topic, which I'm not.  I'm just carving out expertise on this topic through the workshop, the content with Liam. That's it. That's how I ended up at 350, quite an arbitrary, just based on one person's approximation, but there's no other logic to it.

14:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Just as in terms of, it's also a shorter workshop, but the other day I was auditing a workshop for someone.  And they charged, I think, 1500. dollars was a four hour workshop and it was mostly around positioning so not on ICP I mean ICP gets mentioned and positioning such a broad thing but just to give you kind of a possible sense and that the market like that the audience it was not full okay it wasn't full filled with people we were like maybe four but the audience were mostly like professional services sure smaller like between up until 15 people and I know it's different market that you serve but just to give you kind of a benchmark so you're saying 350 is very cheap to me 350 feels feels like  a weird zone. So if I am a solo, it comes out of my pocket, so it means something. And if I'm a company, I need to process it as a purchase, but it's not, so there's some administrative cost to it, but it's not that much that would make a huge difference for you, right?  So I would consider, and also because it signals something, right? The price signals something. So I would consider, but this is only possible if you have your ICP for the ICP defining workshop really, really clear, but I would consider the idea of maybe having different price points and offer like group discounts if companies bring more than one person, like some other way.  It basically it feels too expensive to be like an impulse buyer from another solo, but too cheap to make a huge difference for you in terms of what you could perhaps capture if you're selling to a company.  Unsure, right? This is an hypothesis on my side. Because Liam, as far as understand, I don't think Liam is your ICP, right?  I'm not your ICP. No, no.

17:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  But I reckon it will capture a lot of people like you, Liam, because of the nature of that type of person that who's highly engaged on LinkedIn.  So there's a lot of consultants who are non-marketers, small agency owners, it's like a catch-all for that audience type.  But like the truth is, if I focused on like just SaaS, the total number of people who would actually do it within SaaS is really small, because there's only $12,000.  People in the world in the high GDP countries English speaking with between 10 and 250 employees And I've already connected.  I'm already connecting to Everything I'm connected about thousand of them 1200 of the 12,000 so we go about 10% market penetration I could obviously mass email all of them Obviously, I guess on the smaller side And offer them the workshop and see if I can get that going if they are struggling with that challenge as an entry point There's a lead generation for the workshop If I did that in theory I Could also twice test it so I could segment and send a test to every about 2000 companies to segment it into like Groups of three with three different price points  And then run the free workshop at different price points for the different people to join up Be quite a cost to doing this, but it's it's possible to do be sending out Yeah, I mean I could I could do that but probably take me a couple of months to email all of them We typically are sending three thousand to five thousand emails a month So in theory that would take yeah, two and a half three months to email all of them And I could test the price points.

19:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't know That would be ideal, but I think it's perfectly too complex. Yeah, but I mean for instance it's been active on LinkedIn for for a while and you have your newsletter and You've worked in it on in this industry for a while, right?  your observation that ACP that most people don't get ICP right and they focus on the wrong things and like you're  perspective on ICP is based on your lived experience. So I'm assuming that if you were to call 10 people that you know and say, look, I'm launching this thing, this workshop for ICP, do you know anyone?  Like this classic getting started with the pipeline thing. I think that you could get some people. I don't know what's the conversion rate for that.  Would they be non-SAS people, you mean? No, even if you focus on how many SAS people do you reckon you think you do, you know?  I don't know, really hard to assess.

20:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's a very good question. Like it's an important piece of data or information to have, but I don't have a concrete answer to that number.  I mean, I know how many SAS CEOs I'm connected to, which is another I gave you before. but what is the conversion rate?  But yeah, I mean, I agree, I could email all these people and just say, hey, John, just created this workshop to try to help CEOs of this challenge.  If you have it, I'd be glad to have a chat, but if it's not right for you, but you know someone who it is, let me know, happy to chat to them.  But that's not to say that they'll make the introduction someone they know, you know? So it's like, yeah, if it's broader, ICP-IVP, then yeah, that would work.  Because if it's like a broad audience, I have a very broad network, so that's easy. But considering that I probably want to still niche within SAS, and I can get people saying it and they'll say to me, wait, would it work for me if I'm non-SAS?  And then I can say, I'm going to run a variant that's non-SAS specific if I have enough people are interested, but I wouldn't promote that.  I would just have it as a back-leading in case someone asks me. the backup. I need to figure out how to skillfully communicate that I can cater to it if there's enough demand, but that isn't who it's for.  But if you are that person, I've already had a few people interested, I'm getting a waiting list. And I might include that in the outreach message, I don't know, because I don't want it to dilute the focus.  But I reckon just trying it first with SAS is sensible.

22:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You said you made some sales in terms of ad placement on your newsletter, right? Was that what you said?  No, Okay, so this is a different idea, but would you be open to cross-promoting, like you contacted a few people that have an audience?  and you also pay them to advertise your workshop?

23:07 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I don't know. I don't know who had that criteria.

23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I suspect that this is just an intuition, right? If the thing is priced at the point that you can spend some money on customer acquisition, then you can spend some money on customer acquisition, right?  And you get not only the money, but then you start getting like the flywheel speaking, like you get the testimonials, you get the feedback, you get people, you know, sharing things from the workshop and so on.  And if you're trying to get it to fill it up with 50 people, I think that's about a bit, but if you're trying to get it like to five to ten people and can still make a bit of money and be a good entry point, this seems to be possible.

24:03 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So are you saying it's possible to get 10 to 15 people for organic, but if I wanted a flywheel and creating a paid one to try and scale it to 50, that's more complex, but potentially viable and sensible?  That's why I'm just looking at you're saying. No, no. Then I didn't express myself in the best way.

24:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  first definitions, 50 people at the same time on a workshop, on a workshop session is difficult to manage. Yeah, right.  So especially, I mean, I know you've run workshops, but I would try to steer away from that. I think it's, there's a lot of variability and then you get, you'll have people asking you, how do I use this thing and tech support and it gets messy.  So my suggestion is to look at this in terms of like a product that you have and that you're now proving this product and then  better really develop it further, right? So right now, the product you have is a way of taking people through a process that represents how you think about ICP and IBP, right?  That's the product you have. And the way this product looks like right now is the way it's shaping up to be is a workshop with a canvas or a visual worksheet kind of thing.  Maybe in the future, you adjust what you know, how you do this to be able to run it with 50 people.  for instance, one of the things that really large workshops usually have, they have support staff, not just for technical stuff, but co-facilitators and people like that.  I think starting with 50 people, it's complex. And also it generates, I don't know how you deal with this.  Some people don't deal with it very well, but it generates a lot of stress on your side. because it's your reputation on the line, and you don't want people to have a bad experience because of factors outside of your control, like their Zoom thing not working and stuff like that.  So I'll focus on starting smaller and turning that smallness into a feature, not a bug, right? So a few ideas.  Very selected. you're opening. People can see through the overly click baity stuff, for sure, but it is true that you are trying out the product and you'd like to get feedback from real people.  But it is also true that game recognizes game, and these guys know that you don't need them to do the workshop.  You want them to, but you don't need them. So you could discount it, but not do it for free because then people don't show up.  They need to pay, otherwise they don't show up. So let me synthesize what I'm saying. My suggestion is, consider this workshop, at least for the first few runs, maybe five to 10 runs, smaller, easier to get a class of people together, like a group of people together, and do things that don't scale at this stage, right?  Because you have no social proof for this workshop. You don't have testimonials, you don't have screen grabs, you don't have stuff like that.

27:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You have for other things.

27:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's, yeah, I agree.

27:25 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I don't think it's necessary to have the testimonials for this, because my reputation, pro Paul, and everything that I've got, but it would be ideal.  I think it's only sensible to do 10 15 people, because you need to validate it and confirm it before you scale it, and like a class can't jump to 50, it's too much, and it would be probably too hard and not viable to get to 50 in the first place anyway.  So I'm not, I don't need convincing that 10 to 15 is the right number, but I think the challenge is how to get the right ICP and IVP into it.  the workshop because ideally they assess and saying that I am just kicking off LinkedIn ads and right now we have three ideas the first was the intro offer which is a free six-part email series as a retargeting layer on top of the video content which is top of the funnel the second was this workshop ICP IBP workshop because it's the closest to being the next product that I'm creating and the third was an idea Lee came up with and I call he gave me an example of a guy who charges $147 a month and essentially it's a seminar which is pretty much a webinar that he runs once a month so you're paying him monthly to into the community but there is no community there's no like slack or anything it's just you're one of 400 he's got 450 people  well, paying him $140 a month, which is like, it's great because I've been trying to tackle the community problem for a long time now.  And because I've, you know, I almost launched like was going to launch a community for founders, I just couldn't be  to like deal with the operational complexity of managing this community of startup founders trying to support all of them with their questions and everything would just drive me nuts, you know, and then there's this thing about being free or being paid.  And some founders, it was like, it was really mixed the response in terms of the appetite for it for marketing quite broad.  But I think this format of just one webinar a month on a specific specialized topic in SAS is quite deep, where I've gone through and think about it.  And then I can turn that topic into products for existing clients as well. That's kind of, I like the shape of this idea.  So that's the third idea we had about monetizing option. So in a So 147 a month offer, you know, workshop offer 350, 500, 850, 1000, whatever that is, and then strategic retainer, and then your six-part email intro series, which actually is between the 147 and the workshop.  So there's a kind of the four aspects of my value ladder. So like, you know, the 147 a month, the intro offer based on the intro series is a diagnostic call.  This workshop we're talking about today, and then my strategic retainer. So just trying to get people into the different parts of the four-part value ladder.  I don't know if it's too much. It's quite like four different offers. But then it does make sense to me to have different price value ladders to get people in and nurture them.  I just don't know if it's three offers or four. Four sounds like maybe there's overlap. It feels like maybe it's maybe timing.  So the 147 is like once a month, you could sign up fine. But the workshop is like for people that have a specific problem, maybe that's quarterly.  every other month or something and depending on how many prospects I can generate will show an interest right because I'm not going to run the workshop with as only five people I need to every every time get 15 people in I need to be able to predictably do that and that will define the frequency I run it so I'm assuming right now it's going to be every two or three months right to build it up and get people in and then the strategic container is very expensive so obviously even though I've successfully managed to close lots of business as a result of that it would be amazing to create additional revenue streams because that's my baseline predictable revenue then everything else I can take risk so with this workshop if we find the right price point I can justify paying money on LinkedIn ads to try and get people in right even if it's breakeven under the guise that they'll some of them will become strategic container clients or they'll be able to sell other workshops off you know I could do what I did which was the yeah the bespoke workshop like last week  I did for the client in Manchester on my other client a couple of weeks ago. So I guess it all comes down to like HackLTV, cost of customer acquisition left a value and we won't know until we validate it.  I do think 350 for the intro offer while I validate the workshop is sensible. So like this is a discounted rate because I've just launched this so intro offer rate and then it's good because that kind of anchors you know the price but under intro so I can always raise it once I've done that part of that packaging.  I don't know how hard or easy it's going to get 10 to 15 people. I just let go of my cold outbound agency because they didn't deliver ROI at all.  Very disappointing. Could you repeat please? had a cold email outbound agency that I just fired. But I'm still going I'm just talking to a freelancer because I reckon I can still do that run it with a freelancer a third of the cost but that's great opportunity to push this.  generate meetings to close the retainer and close people on the workshop. And it's a nice sensible use of cold outbound email as an entry offer into engaging with me in order to sell them a strategic retainer later on.  So I like the shape of this as a channel to deploy this workshop when 350 is probably quite reasonable.  I think what I could do is maybe price it by different target segments so I can target a few different companies in terms of sizes and different price points.  So that's possible as well. I need to think that through in more detail.

33:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you do that, I think one thing that might be helpful is think in terms of now next later.  So some of those strategies make sense for now and some could be for later when you have more information on this.

33:57 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And I found that whenever I try

34:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to use like this different time horizons, it alleviates some of the pressure that I need to use this insight right now, otherwise I'll lose it and there's value in this insight.  But maybe you don't have this thing.

34:12 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm not experiencing it right now. I think right now I'm trying to de-risk and understand what the bottlenecks are and I don't have clarity over pricing, I don't have clarity of acquisition channel.  So those are the two things that are material that I'd like to know.

34:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, given this context, I think this was very useful in terms of like your business objectives for this, like the context of you as an entrepreneur.  But I don't think it changes the mechanics of what we've designed so far, right? No, I don't think.

35:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I mean, what we've designed so far has just evolved into having the additional collateral, like the additional pieces that I created in the spreadsheet and evolved into the images with Liam.  The problem is we created one image with Liam, which is the one I showed you. Then we were going to create another variant of how it applies to four different businesses.  We created that actually on the last call, and the next one we're going to continue. But I'm going to hijack that call to get him to help me with the creating of my talk, called Touring Fest, because obviously it's a big talk.  maybe I can use that talk on my other speaking event I'm doing, because I'm doing a hyper growth. show, which is also two, 300 people, so quite large.  I thought I was like, they had to speak because I'm only one of two. It's bit stressful to have, you're kind of like, you know, you look at these people have like large followings, the very succession, you kind of go like, I wish I was in that person's shoes.  then like, and you are, and then the performance pressure is like, , like no one prepared me or mentally helped, like, you know how like, no one told me how to do that, how to be a great speaker, how to make kick- presentations, how to create a great narrative.  Like being knowledgeable is not enough to be successful, know, it's not, you know, we need to like, crack these things.  So I'm feeling a lot of increased performance pressure with being like, now the mantle, you know, it's like  April Dunford and Rand Frickin was speaking at the stage of Turing Fest.  So it's like, you know, when you look at how many speakers there were, there weren't that many. I'm suddenly in this top tier of top speaker.  And like, I'm not claiming to be in April Dunford. know in her first year when she launched her book in 2018 she did 50 speaking events.  Can you imagine every week during the speaking event like she really  honed her skill and craft in that and since then I don't know how many she's doing but she does a lot and she does some really high I mean she does Sastok would be my deal it's a larger event and much more relevant there's a niche and anyway I'm going to hijack Leon and then go back to this essentially the idea year is over the first few months once Ryu and I finish the workshop and it's like we're both confident it's good enough to go live by then I should have four or five posts or six posts with some LinkedIn budget to try and promote and push it and then we'll try and if there's appetite on the market and how it performs I'm pretty confident it will it will go well in terms of like the appetite because it's even today in my client call it came up like it's it's a it's a common issue my business is pacing oh for sure and I think

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that everyone is filling the screens on distribution.

38:05 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's becoming really difficult.

38:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think sometimes we think that we can fix distribution with product development. And I think there's some aspects of it that are improved by product development.  But it's also easy to miscalculate that and just put too much focus on product development to solve distribution.

38:32 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  maybe the move sometimes is just to pay to play and assume that reach is not what it used to be and stuff like that.  OK, so let me share my screen with you.

38:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  this is our third session.

38:50 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  we are closing in. Do you see the chat message? There's a link.

39:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  for the mirror?

39:01 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, it just takes forever to load.

39:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's good to know. It's a mirror, I think, it's not. Yes, yes, but this is also an interesting thing because our mirror is now quite populated, right?  And because of that, there's a lot of stuff that we don't need anymore. But still being rendered.

39:32 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So I might just hide it.

39:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll hide it and resize it.

39:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And that will help us improve performance. I'm going to try to find the problem.

39:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ciao. Hopefully, this should start to help us. It's also an interesting data point because as we work more and more with Miro, not everyone has the same computer, like sometimes I have a good computer, but sometimes people don't have good computers, so that ends up being a new limitation.

40:23 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  My computer is like top-end.

40:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. So if you remember from last session, I reviewed the last session with Point Give Notes. We came into this structure where we help companies that they do have some sort of a product.  They have something, but their ICP definition is flimsy or non-existent. We start with the more certain, the more concrete, is their product.  And through the product, So we move into the in-market IVP, right? And if you remember, we start with what's most concrete, which from a workshop perspective is also a good type of exercise, because people don't need to imagine much to just do it.  And then we list what kind of pain points it addresses. And then we connect the benefits to the features, right?  It's kind of an odd structure. But the idea is that it forces people not to keep thinking about their own world, their own company, their own product, and forces them to think about the people they serve and then see if they match what they have developed.  From there, we move into ICP definition. And this is a bit of an iceberg, because there's so many things around ICP definition that you've shared with me.  And then we get more specific. And we move into IVP definition, right?

41:55 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And figuring out what the IVPs are for this.

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and the idea is always to connect the features to the in-market IVPs, right? Do you remember?

42:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Not in-market IVPs, okay? In-market and out-of-poke markets.

42:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, in terms of... I think maybe you froze there for a second.

42:29 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  No.

42:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, my understanding of this is the common mistake around ICP is not doing it or doing it to a level that is too static and too broad, right?  Basically, it's the failure mode of defining ICP, correct? Yes. Okay. So, and then we move into a more sophisticated view, which is not about the ICP, it's about...  I B P and it's not about all of your I B P's is like you're in market I B P's And a reminder the name and the number was like 3% or so are you know?

43:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I Think we should remove This concept of in market to out of market in the concept of ICP I B P Because almost all of these businesses are going to be Targeting businesses without knowing if they're market or not Mm-hmm, and but it's not ICP or IVP.  It's IVP plus IVP Yes, yes, yes So IVP is a set of the ICP correct The yeah, I think this image encapsulates it really well.  I Don't know if you can see it. Yes. Mm-hmm Yeah, so you can see I would be interesting actually if you explain  what you see. I'm curious to see how you perceive this image, because I guess you're very familiar with the visual language, but you may be less familiar.  mean, now you're getting more familiar with ICP-IBP, if you view this, how do you interpret it?

44:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we can see that the IBP is more focused on the role and the kind of decision-making range someone has inside of the ICP.  Because of the different colors, I understand that the same ICP could have multiple IBPs. And I think in this context, you have used examples, right?  On, you say, create product videos, the limitation, the frustration, the objective. For my understanding, this is just putting meat on the bones of this visual framework.  If that is the case, I think it could be useful to put in the title or something, something that says, like, oh, for instance, and then you say, we will be talking about someone that sells whatever, you know?  I don't know if I was clear. My point is ...

45:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Not clear on the title bit, sorry. Yeah, okay.

45:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I understand what this means, right? There's a more general view and a more precise view. And the general view contains multiple precise views, right?  There's multiple different people. And the way you've illustrated this in this picture, especially in the boats, the job to be done, frustration, imitation and objective, was by filling it in with example data.  it's mock data yes but because that example is not named I have to read through this and then assume that I understand what you're talking about okay so the ICPs e-commerce fashion UK built on Shopify and this IBP persona who is this guy oh it's probably a marketing guy I guess you know if you name the IBP person persona here for the green one I think is useful even just for instance even just putting like technical buyer if you just put this here and here and then I put the then I put the what was the other one the champion I don't remember my heart they're the left technical buyer economic buyer user buyer production

47:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  But these are different, I think the problem is, what you're describing here, if you look at the four circles I just put at the bottom, it's almost like this is the ideal buyer persona and this might be the user buyer, but actually there's the support personas in the periphery of ICP-1, so it could be that this is a buying committee, but ideal buyer persona too would be a different job title in a different, like a variant in the ICP that's not part of this buying committee.  That's where it can get maybe a bit confusing.

47:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the way I would represent, I'll make a quick sketch, the way I would represent this is... I think I would just use this.

48:37 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  One second because the mirror is on the main screen and I can't seem to get you onto my main screen and the mirror off my main...  Okay, ICP, IBP1, IBP2, IB3. That's what we have in there at the moment.

48:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, conceptually, yes, but not visually is not represented.

49:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  What it is, the green, yellow, and purple is exactly what you just did. It is not. That is the same content, but it's not the same format.

49:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you were the same format, it would look like this. But I understand your point.

49:13 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  We are seeing the same thing.

49:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't understand the difference.

49:17 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Show me what you did. Okay. I don't understand the difference. only difference I can see is that I have the criteria of the ICP, as well as the IBPs in the circle.  What's the point, what's the difference that you're highlighting that I'm missing?

49:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The major, so there's two ideas that this picture is conveying. The first one is that IVP is a subset of ICP.

49:53 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  That's the first one.

49:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the second idea is what are the characteristics that define that define an IVP. And these two things at the same time, in the same picture, I think that they are what make this picture a little bit slower to read, to interpret.  I'm not a criminal thing, right?

50:13 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  No, Yeah, I really don't know you're saying. Essentially you're saying you're defining both ICP and IVP at the same image.  In the same image, yes. We purposefully did that. I guess it makes sense when you read the body of the post with the image, it will make more sense.  And maybe with the body of the post, we'll explain this in more detail, so it's easier to understand the points you highlighted.  What this doesn't case to, is product champion used by economic biotechnical bio in the sales process. That's what's missing here.  But I'm personally, at the moment, not clear on how it should be. So like right now, I'm personally not clear.  just saying they're missing.

51:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's also, so the other day I was attending something and someone used the visual framework to explain their process, right?  And it made sense, the visual framework made sense. But it was complex. Seven stages, three sub steps for each of the seven stages.  It was coherent, but when I first saw it, it was overwhelming, right? It was much more complex in this one.  So I think there's also an element of how you introduce a visual framework, right?

51:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  How you build it up in the minds of people.

51:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because the advantage of visuals is that you can read them kind of through any direction you want instead of top to bottom on the stacks.  But that's also its disadvantage is that different people kind of focus on different things. We read in the z shape, but we kind of pay attention to different things.  So the synthesis of what I'm saying is that maybe it's just a matter of how you introduce this thing piecemeal, you know, instead of a static picture, it could be just like a set of two pictures and that, that, that would be enough.  But the basic idea that the two basic ideas of IVPs are a subset of ICPs, yes, that is clear.  The idea that IVPs are defined by a certain type of parameters, that's also clear. I think my only hiccup in the reading of this, you know what I would actually help?  If you just do the same thing with a green circle, you just put a yellow one at the edge, people understand that this is a zoom in.  A little bit of a slice of the pink one at the edge as well and automatically people understand Okay, we are just focusing on the one as an example, but the other ones us as detailed as this is You know what I mean?

53:18 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay, I got the feedback but it's fine I reckon with the other buying committee to use the biotech go by economic buyer It's probably too complex to introduce this into this image as well And I think what you're taking about carousel or expanding this into a carousel I introduce customer profile next slide is idea by persona And next slide is been committed and then visually tying it together to explain it It's sensible that doing it all in one image would be overwhelming probably yeah And I think we when I look at the image we have on the left here Right feature benefits pain  It's quite interesting. I haven't actually done that with the client my recent client We kind of jumped straight into let me share my screen with you What can you see Your notion it seems yes You So here Gold if I multiple ICPs I BPs the sign of how it's relevant for formal form of graphic and here We went through the criteria and the way I did this actually is I used perplexity To generate quite a few of these and then I validated it with the CEO  And then we talked about it, we went through them, we had a conversation and we identified what's not relevant as well.  So I created like an exclusion list. And then we went into the IVP. So here you can see job titles, qualification for the IVP.  But if you notice, there isn't a mapping of features to benefits. I'm trying to think why not, why didn't we do it?  I think it would have been ideal to do it that way. Mapping the feature to the benefit. I think it's because they connected the value prop, the crux of the value proposition rather than individual features.  And if you ask me why, I think the fundamental features are secondary to the crux of the challenge they have, which is do organizations understand the value proposition as a whole rather than the features.  So essentially it's like that people need to want to invest in employee engagement incentive and gift culture and reward and recognition culture.  So first they have to believe in the culture, then they need to have enough budget like so for example when they went to retailers, they understood the retail like you know if you work at Starbucks you're in 10 pounds an hour, 15 pounds an hour and the business doesn't have for the budget or the interest.  in giving a reward and gifting culture because the employee value is to compare to a tech company where an employee is paid 100-200k a year and then you want to invest in recognition and reward so there's like a budget constraint so there's a cultural issue an incentive issue and then the third factor is understanding their solution as a whole rather than necessarily just going down into the features and I think because of this they we didn't go into we didn't build it up on feature basic level because problems they're having a more more they're more fundamental but maybe that's a mistake maybe the problem is that they're not well articulating the features and the features are specific problems in jobs to be done that people have and that they're facing they're facing the assumption that there's an issue  the conceptual understanding of the budgets, but actually the problem is a lack of clarity understanding of the features and how they benefit from them.  So, yeah, maybe product perspective, benefit perspective, yeah. I don't know the name benefit perspective, but it's just a bit of a placeholder.

58:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's value prop, new profit. Where do I change the value prop? Benefit perspective, yeah.

58:31 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Because not benefit, it's like the value prop. Yeah, I guess you can do value prop perspective. This might be just internal, right?

58:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  horizontal ones, I think they use it just for themselves. you Just putting better labels. Yeah, I'm not sure about ICP.

59:04 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I don't I feel like I don't know What don't I know I think what can happen Is that there's different features for different ibp's and different icp's that matter and therefore they need to be mapped But there's some organizations Where there's no difference in their feature set between ibp's and icp's and I think that's the problem

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  right the divergence on the framework is dependent on that business that business is context between the two Okay, um, I hear you let me just Okay, so Okay Perspective and IDPs decision maker perspective that this is User perspective Okay, and Doesn't have different features For ACPs IPPs and different.

1:01:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay. Okay, so we are forking this. Okay. Yeah, I think I think so I think the idea is Like in the matrix in the workshop we kind of go which one are you are here?  Do you think you have different features for different ICPs IPPs? Do you know if you don't? No, you automatically fall into you have different features for different ACPs.  And then when you go through this process, maybe you'll end up with realizing you don't, but that's okay. So don't worry about it.  And but if you don't know, so I don't know if you want a third one, which is, you know, don't know, like this.

1:01:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

1:01:28 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And then if they do, if they do have different features, they go through a lens, which is feature led.  And if they don't, then we don't go through the feature benefit. Actually, I think we still do benefit on pain points, but we wouldn't do features, right?

1:01:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you We don't have any of the small squares. just have the big ones Okay, let's role play this a little bit the question is Do you have different features?

1:02:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay Yeah, we can use a couple of my clients as examples and pretend So we can use hug as one that doesn't that features are the same five p and icp and You know what I'm just going to ask my client give me a second And all of this This  I'm not sure. We have an ETS-ish question. Okay, I've asked Hogg if they, have different features for different ICPs, IVPs.  I think for our aim right now, if we validate this, what we can do is pretend that Hogg don't, but then another one of my clients hands HQ, I know they have different ICPs and IVPs.  they like, even today he was describing events, companies versus, actually I just want to ask, You know, I'm just going to ask my other client.  I'm going to ask client. I'm just going to ask my other client. Okay, I've actually asked both my clients now if they think they have different features for different ICPs, IPPs.  It's kind of awkward because I should kind of know the answer to that.

1:06:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But... Come to me, it's on this side. Yeah, I'm following you. Okay. Okay. And do they have...?

1:07:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  After the workshop, this is concrete. This is also concrete for the workshop, so let's concrete. I'll try to follow the red and green line.  No, no, no, yes. Okay. Yeah, I'm with you. Sorry, Rosa.

1:07:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What did they tell you, your clients? I just literally asked them now on Slack.

1:07:26 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So it's improbable. They'll get back to me in time, especially if it's 5 p.m. So, you know, at the very least, there shows on my very industrious and I'm of expert in specializing in this.  So yeah, perfect.

1:07:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me explain you the line here. So my current assumption is that most people or most companies or a lot of companies don't define ICP correctly, right?  And they very vague ICPs if they have them at all, right? If they don't have ICPs, they're probably even less so, they don't have IPPs, right?  No ICP for sure, no IPP. And what I'm thinking is, before the workshop, what's an anchor we have that ties the discussion to the concrete?  I think it's the product features or the value prop. It's something that is inside of their company and they can just say, yes, we know this.  So we begin the workshop with a very tangible, addressable thing instead of wishy-washy stuff, right? And so we begin this process of helping them define the IPPs by what they already have in front of them, right?  And this is actually like getting a list of product features. This could be pre-work, it's very easy to do, right?  Right, pre-work.

1:09:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  to be able to do that live on the workshop.

1:09:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Depends, because sometimes, ideally, yes, but sometimes people feel very self-conscious about it. Like, I should know this. Exactly the interaction we just had.  were like, I should.

1:09:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's impossible for someone in their business not to know their features. like you not knowing what you sell. It's not possible.

1:09:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. And? You sound skeptical, Drew.

1:09:27 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You sound like, no, the people who come to the workshop, like, if they don't know their features, they're .  Like, nothing I'm going to do is going to be able to save them. I agree. I agree.

1:09:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do they feel confident that they know the features? this is a more? 100%. OK.

1:09:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, the reason it's embarrassing for me is because I meant to really know my clients so well that I already know all of this.  But that's kind of the irony, I guess, of having to do it with them is getting them to fill this out now in a spreadsheet is really like.

1:10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  foundational work which I think is quite pivotal yeah okay so it doesn't have doesn't have to be pre-work but this is still the most the more concrete thing about this whole endeavor right just tell me what you do and they can just list it right but only if they're in the green bucket yeah if they're in the pink even if even if they even if they're in the pink it doesn't matter that so right now let me just think it doesn't make sense for them to waste time on it no no let me finish the thing is one of our assumptions is that our unit our assumptions I think unstated assumptions which is interesting is that people often have an is led interpretation of what's their value proposition right and whether it matters for their clients  I think a good example of this is when you get like these statements that mean nothing right and the clients are like what you stand for that I never knew no so does this seem true to you this this thing I just said I think it's rare to meet a business that doesn't know the value prop yes it's more common to meet a company that's skeptical unsure if the value prop has been articulated or communicated in the right way in the market okay okay so but we're not we're not going into messaging and positioning so this is sure that's a that's a leaner workshop mm-hmm now this is not about messaging I'll need three minutes to go from one end to the other  explain you like the director's track on the DVD like on this scene we were trying to do this thing.  First bits, if they don't have clear ACP or decent ICP we need to build it up so they can have that discussion around ICP.  And the way we build it up we start with the things they know the best which are like the product features.  And then we are trying to account for the fact that sometimes the product features don't mean anything for the user.  So if they don't mean anything for the user it should not be the main thing driving the ICP and IBP discussion.  We should focus on benefits and features that relate to the ICP and the IBP. We ask them to list the features.  We ask them to describe what their users are trying to to fix which is like a super quick version of jobs to be done.  And then we ask them please connect these two right and they might be it's likely that they'll be confronted with the fact that some things address more than one more than one pain point and some things really don't matter with that information we can move into which things like matter the most and how do they hint at possible ICPs that are open to what we do and from there we have gained another foothold conceptual foothold and from there we move into the IPP over because this makes sense are you okay if we just literally go one pillar by one pillar we do everything you just did but just do it slower and sequentially yeah yeah so if I remember correctly you said the users don't care about the features no what I mean yeah what I mean is that the users oftentimes you  Often times users don't care about the same features that you think they care.

1:14:07 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Essentially, does that mean that you don't understand your customers' jobs to be done, right? You don't understand where try to get done.  Yes. And you think there's a mismatch between your feature and the jobs to be done. Or are you saying that there's a mismatch between which jobs to be done is more significant between the jobs to be done.  So for the priority list for your user, are you saying both? I'm saying mostly the first one. Interesting. I agree that there's that one as an issue.  I think they're both issues. And the question is, do I articulate these in the workshop?

1:14:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. I think that's a very important question. Let's role-play this. Imagine that we don't have this bit, OK? So if we don't try to surface the mismatch between their expectations of what matters for the customer and what actually matters, if we don't try to surface that.  So let's say we take out this thing. We begin with product features. And then based on these product features, we try to figure out which markets would be open to this.  And based on that, we try to figure out which people inside of this ICP would be open to it.

1:15:30 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  If you have enough customers and data, you can skip three and two. But if you don't have enough customers and data or you're struggling, then you screwed by doing that.  OK.

1:15:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So is this the first instance of us slicing this up for different? We already covered that in a previous step.

1:15:54 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  If you go to where I scroll to, once I find it. We covered it off somewhere here. Where was it?

1:16:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you can describe what you're looking for, maybe I can find it. We already create here.

1:16:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Here, you see step one, have customers, don't have customers. Step zero. I think that's the key criteria before that would define whether or not it makes sense to whether or not they need to do step three and two.  Okay.

1:16:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This was related to a different process, right?

1:16:47 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  We didn't say a variant rather than different, if I remember right, but let's look because this was the original layout for this worksheet.  We should, in theory, have overlap between them. No, there is some of it. I mean, what we're doing now is more like it's, in a way, simpler than like using replets to pull the data in the market.  I don't know if I'll enter that in the worksheet, but I may not do it or I may do it.  I don't know. I haven't decided on that replet thing, that old replet step and how to do it. I'm just trying to evaluate is it necessary or not.  Like, for example, when I did my workshop last week, the CEO, the 20 million ARR business, the 6,000 customers, he said, I don't want to sell to larger businesses.  I can get five SMEs at the same amount of effort cost me to get a big one, then I've got procurement and it's a head .  So I'm happy to just go get small business and get a lot of them. And I said, okay, and who do you sell to?  And he said, well, we sell to HR managers and we sell to

1:18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  or business owners.

1:18:01 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And I went to sales navigator, and I typed in HR managers in 10 to 250 employees. And I said, there's only 20,000 HR managers in the UK.  And then I removed that and put in director, managing director, CEO, founder of the same size businesses.

1:18:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And there were a million people.

1:18:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  And I said, look, if you're going to target a market, target the market has a million people, rather than market has 20,000, because you're starting to the decision maker.  Other than today, Charm manager, who's lower down. But if you look at that, I have to go to the navigator to select the job title, select the employee count.  And like that's a pretty broad ACP, like they're very broad with their proposition. If there was a business that was more niche, like hug, or each queue, they have more specific niches.  And like doing that real time would be too difficult. And so if I had to do that multiple 15 people, they'd all have sales navigator licenses, and I wouldn't be able to do it.  it could pretty easily. I don't know if I could do it easily. I think we're rearing a little bit off track on this because I understand the right that I've called into a drug into a rabbit hole of that replete step one because I'm trying to figure out something if to include it and I'm trying to evaluate if it's worth it but yes it's not it's too big a it's too big a rabbit hole to include and it would potentially be a blocker for going live with the workshop and it's unnecessary yeah I think we can that's a great webinar if you want to do it like just sharing your screen and going through it I think people would be interested in that but just pulling you back here so the the we went there to discuss one specific thing which was by removing steps two and three and what does that mean in terms of  If you don't have enough customers, and you do that, then you're at a high risk. Oh, sorry, that's interesting.  Not only if you don't have enough customers, if you don't have enough of the right customers. So one of my ex-clients, they had 130 businesses.  And when I talked, and he said he got 130, I said, yeah, I'm sure we'll be able to work for you.  But then once I got into the business, only five of the 130 will write fit customers. And they were all incredibly different customers because they're not niched.  They're too broad. And then I said, okay, how did you get the five? And the five came for a friend, someone to see how it went golfing with, a mutual connection through their VC who's a shed investor, so another portfolio client from the same investor.  And it's like none of them came from a repeatable proven cold audience. They all came through network, which is like a non, you can't validate that as a way to scale the business.  But essentially, the three criteria are, you don't have customers, you have customers but they're not the right type of customer, or you have plenty of customers and they're the right type of customer.  If you're the third, you have enough data that you already know, so you probably don't need to break your head over mapping.  Then you could do it because it gives a lot of clarity and validation to the strategy. I would recommend you do it, but you don't have to do it.  But what we could do is force them to do it, because then it gets everyone on the same page, forces them to do it, they get more value out of it, maybe we just do that.  So even though technically you could exclude it, maybe we just force them to do it. Because if, let's assume they don't need to do it, it would actually be very easy and quick for them to do it.  So it's not like they have to break their head over. So in that case, why not just do it for everyone?

1:21:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because that's easier, right?

1:21:50 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's easier for me, easier for the flow of the workshop and potentially the experience benefit from it. So just so I don't miss it, what were the three?  The three you you have customers you don't have customers you have customers But they're not the ideal customer pipe So it's like this, right?  When you say qualifying workshop participants it's not qualifying workshop participants It's just trying to figure out which one of the step three and step two are relevant or not relevant for There's no qualifying them Okay, so yeah, if I did to have 15 people and seven  had customers and some of them didn't, I would actually split the workshops into two. I wouldn't run people who don't have customers and people who do have customers in the same workshop.  I would only do it if I don't have enough participants.

1:23:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so is this correct?

1:23:24 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, I think I have enough customers of the ideal type. How do you know it's enough? It's because there's a large enough volume and the hemogen is enough to define a clear ICP and clear IBP.  But like, know, so it could be five, but they're all exactly the same industry in similar size with the exact same title.  But when I look at like hands HQ, we just did an analysis on the ICP and IBP on the older people associated with DL1.  And we found that, like, yes, health and safety is the primary, but they also sell to operations and they primarily sell to managers, but they also sell to, like, a few other job title functions.  So essentially, there was quite a fragmentation. It wasn't all homogeneous.

1:24:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, look over.

1:24:24 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:24:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this roughly correct? If your customer profile is that you have enough of the right type, you don't need to entree.  Okay.

1:25:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's because we need a half-mortar to speak Portuguese. Yes. I heard Portuguese. Yes, I'm in Portugal.

1:25:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm surprised that they speak Portuguese in Portugal.

1:25:14 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's insane.

1:25:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, mean, come to think of it, there's so many indigenous nomads. Sometimes it's in Brazilian.

1:25:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Is it true that the Portuguese and Brazilian actually have cultural conflicts? Someone was telling me that the way Portuguese treat Brazilians is like in poor taste or something.  Someone's telling me it was so significant that his wife, whose Brazilian is not willing to move to Portugal as a result.

1:25:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it is true.

1:25:49 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  What is it? How would you define it?

1:25:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a bit of a long conversation, but basically... the cultures are very different, and they are different in a way that conflicts like we are much more introspective, quiet, speak lower, and Brazilians tend to be more animated, more like Latin America versus Europe, so to say, and also there's a lot of condescending, condescension, I don't know, like, Portuguese tend to feel condescended about Brazil, because they think it's just, I used to be a colony or a poor country, you have favelas and stuff like that, and these things interact because whenever you see like the loud Brazilians, like low-class kind of behavior, selling stuff in the metro, that contributes to that image, but then you have like a whole set of other Brazilians that are so much more cosmopolitan than most Portuguese, and they get put in  same bucket. And for them, because they are used to be royalty in Brazil, like if you are of a certain class in Brazil, you are very used to be treated with difference.  Different, right? I think that's what you said.

1:27:13 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So, and when they don't get that from Portugal, they feel, I think, fairly treated.

1:27:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  unfairly treated. And it's also what you look for. For instance, if you move to Portugal looking for Brazilian culture, you will miss it.  you move to Portugal looking for a different culture, maybe you'll find things that you like. And the people that I miss what they left behind in Brazil, right?  But definitely there's xenophobia from Portugal towards Brazil. And now I think it's inverting. People are getting a bit resentful.  And it just feeds on itself right you get like these Brazilians now this is just payback for colonization and we'll be allowed and Take your jobs suck it up.

1:28:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  You know, so yeah, it's kind of a no way of no one wins with that But anyway, this was a little bit of a detour, but yeah, the observation is basically correct Um people have enough clients of the of the ideal type they can move from product feature to the ICP to the IDP I think we just have to take everyone through it because It's I can't What am I gonna do say everyone who doesn't have it just wait half an hour while I sort everything Oh, no, no, no, yeah, you have to mean like two different workshops.  Yeah, so I think we just remove we just include all of them So we just exclude this whole Don't know no, I think it's good to like  say like you're one of these three types and regardless of the three types we're going to go through this process so they feel that okay it's you know the reasoning behind it okay I think it's a good exercise like even now if I think about all my clients like if they all had feature mapping to the value prop to the m drops to be done the icp and ibp and they had a whole grid I think that would be very good maybe I'll show you the ones I created well that's actually someone else created it that I use for my client because I didn't have the all of this done I'm just going to share my screen and show it to you so let me know once you can see my screen

1:30:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, wait, yes, yes, I can see a screen. Okay, so we've got ICP 1, ICP 2, ICP 3.  And you have the priorities for that.

1:30:12 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  The ICPs here, you have the segment, how you define it. And there's lots of different ways to define a segment, depending on what the key criteria is.  Because sometimes it could be a technology, sometimes it could be a challenge, sometimes it could be geography, so it varies.  So there is no default correct segment name. Here you can see the criteria for photographic. I'll let you scan, just let me know next, then I'll go to the next section.  Okay, next section. Technographic, what technologies they use. So when you say next, I'll go to the next one. Next.  There are challenges that are specific to the ICP, the account level. Strategic goals, what they're trying to accomplish. Triggers, what are the triggers that we can identify to reach out to them?  which we talked about, I think, in one of the previous workshops together. This qualification, did you not have a salesperson?  Account sources, where can we get data to identify them? buying committee role? What are the roles within the three steps?  can see it's kind of missing the economic. It's missing the four ones for the medic. And then real examples of companies.  Any question around ACP worksheet? No. I.B.P., so job title, challenges, goals, activities and responsibilities, needs, where you can find them in examples.  Then for this client, I added a list of all the triggers that we can identify to try and identify which are relevant to figure out the right companies.  and then the same for IBP. Okay. And then there's intent data. So what you can look at in terms of behavioral data to try and identify potential ICP or IBP.  So if you have any of this data, you can obviously use it to prioritize based on prospects. So this doesn't help with your target list, but it helps you prioritize with prospects who you are engaging and bringing into your funnel.  Got it. Overall, this two sheets are really the crux of the workshop. The triggers, maybe the other sheets are nice to have because triggers and signals, they make this work a pop because it's an additional layer of richness.  But I don't know if it's too... or complex or out of scope, maybe it's like a worksheet I give them rather than like, it's like something for them to do on the workshop, like highlight, but we're not going to get into how to do it on the workshop.  It's like for you to consider these triggers when you go to market to identify your ICP and IBP and do distribution.  Any questions on any of the tabs or what this is The intent data, can you role play an example please?

1:33:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so one that is not green on both columns, one that's like medium easy.

1:33:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, okay, you're trying to identify if an account and a person are relevant. They fill in a form which is gated content.

1:34:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  some content.

1:34:01 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So the relevancy is medium because you don't know if the intent is high or low. You know that the intent isn't low because they fill in the form, but you don't know if the intent is high.  So because it's not low, but you don't know if it's high, it's medium. difficulty to identify them, it's very easy because they fill in the form.  But if you look at a prospect visited the resources on your website, it's the medium, it's difficulty. Why? Because you're dependent on software like Snitcher or Lead Forensics to identify the account, it may not have identified the account, and you need to go find the right person in the account and reach out to them.  So even if they are ICP-IBP criteria, it's still difficult relative to someone who just filled in the form on your website.  So he's just gone through two to try and help you identify prospects who may be ICP-IBP, but there's two parts to the  the this definition of ICP-IBP. One is Are we using your existing data to define in the criterion who ICP-IBP is?  If you don't have data obviously not, but if you do then we do. So it's the hypothesis of data med.  Step one, step two We clearly put them in a framework and define them, which is you know feature jobs to be on pain, IBP-ICP, matrix, step two, everything we just did, and then step three is going to the market to identify who fits the criteria that you just defined and the disqualification and the qualification.  And this is part of step three.

1:35:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you have a visual framework in there. It's a good post.

1:35:49 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  This thing is a 2x2, right?

1:35:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It can be converted into a 2x2 very easily. And you can make a nice visual out of this. They're useful for people.

1:36:09 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  OK, I need to ask the guy who created it.

1:36:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are you asking now?

1:36:28 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm Thank Let's see how protective he is over this.

1:37:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would assume that if you give him credit.

1:37:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'm not going to give him credit. I said I'm going to tag him as a collaborator and he can use the image for his own profile as well.  Okay, that's a better way.

1:37:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the reason you're showing me this is because these are the assets you use on your own workshop, and we're trying to match this to the workshop we're designing now.  And we are entering the tail end of this time slot and I think we have more conviction on what we're doing.  But I think we need to lay down a few more stakes on the ground for how this would look like as a workshop, So we have agreed that everyone, regardless of how much data they have, they should go through this.  People that have enough customers of the ideal type might do it for different reasons. We'll be sparking that discussion.  Yeah, I think we'll just say it's a foundation for your go-to-market strategy. For all of them?

1:38:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, but for the ones who have customer data and don't need to do step two or step three, it will still help them.

1:38:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

1:38:58 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Unless they've already done it. If they didn't, what the  are they showing up to ICP IBP workshop?

1:39:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sometimes people have done things, but they don't know that they have done them to the right degree. And they trust you as an expert to help them, you know, validate what they've done.

1:39:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So that's his fault as well.

1:39:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's fine. We'll be getting started. Okay. Perfect. So let's try to put some meat on these bones. We begin by having an exercise that looks like make a list of your product features.  like that. Size. List. Features. Okay. And then we move on to the other exercise and we should ask them identify user pain points.  On this, on this, on this thing, there's two different ways we can do this. Okay. Two different strategies for this exercise.  A, they can write anything down, which looks a lot like the first exercise. And E, they select from the list.  And C was Suggest, yeah, oh, okay, can I, is it clear? It's only A.

1:41:08 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Tell me more. I don't know the features for the product, so how are they gonna select it from the list?  No, no, I'm talking about user pain points right now.

1:41:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if I'm sharing my screen, no, I'm not sharing my screen. You know, but I can see the mirror.

1:41:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Oh, even if you're talking about user pain points, how are they, like, what am I gonna have a list of every user pain points possible?  Like, it's not viable. Yes, yes, but I would not suggest that, right?

1:41:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's like types of user pain points, right? When we think of, I think a good way of looking at this is...

1:41:40 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think it's too generic.

1:41:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you suggest that they'll just write the pain points that they have. Yeah, I can show them the format for how to write it.

1:41:53 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Perfect, I But I'm not gonna give them a list, but let's just validate this to make sure. And loom, have good  feature for sharing video Right and enabling people to comment on the video for collaboration. So you can easily share it and collaborate on it the next product is and Well gmail and gmail lets you send emails to people and Allows you to send emails to other people Mm-hmm.  So you could claim collaboration is the feature that gmail and loom both share right one does through comments One does through bcc and cc.  You can say yeah, the user pain point is a need for collaboration with other users they call this And what happens about the other features?  What if functionally sending an email functionally recording a video, right? So you could say communicating a message. Okay, if I said to you My product communicate helps you communicate messages more clearly Now tell me based on that description which one is my product is my  product use for sending email is my predict sending use for sending video, which one would you say? You'd say you don't know why?  Because description is too ambiguous. So therefore, the user pain point of it is articulated too poorly. It's too non specific.  So it's not a good, it doesn't do a good job. So if you said if you agree with this, I would have to go more granular.  Now we'd have to say, the users pain point is the inability to record and easily share the video for collaboration.  For Gmail, it's attach or send a document or send a message real time to one or multiple users. And now you see, at that level of granularity, they're incredibly explicit in different solutions and features, and they're not bundled anymore into collaboration.  Correct? Do you agree with me? now that we've run through that, I can't imagine giving them a list and capturing it and it being good enough and specific enough.  So I think what I need to do is give it literally walk them through the example I just gave you as an example of like if you got to this you paint that's really poor like if you get to collaborate that's really generic you need to get it so explicit that it's obvious what is the solution and technology that you provide and that would make a good user pain point.

1:44:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let's pick this up getting a reference here we can use this sorts of thing. I'm not saying it's this thing but this sort of thing right in terms of a structure.

1:44:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  But now you pulled in more than the user perspective you pulled in the benefits so you've got the as an account manager, so IBP job title.  I want a sales report of my account to be sent, so I want feature so that I can jobs to be done.  So the problem is you've merged product feature.

1:45:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you understand that I'm not saying it's this exact thing, it's just a way of presenting them with a structure that everyone writes the same, the same sort of sentence.  Even I'm not saying is this structure, but this idea that we give them place folders that they can fill in and then it looks comparable.  But we just do that for the user pain point, yes? Okay, so let's use this example. Let's use the Loom example, okay?  so Loom helps a lot of different people, right? So let's say as I just want to confirm one thing.

1:46:06 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Are you now providing an example of just for pillar 2? Are you providing the user story which is a culmination of 1, 2, 3?

1:46:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'm providing an example of what I mean with this. But this is just for column 2, right?

1:46:21 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Not for all 3. Okay, cool.

1:46:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  As a remote developer, to show how... This could be something that Lou addresses, right?

1:47:54 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So you said, as a remote developer, I want to show how I'm going to person my side async. I don't need to  I'm gonna call in my mind what we do on column two is literally the can't record the video Can't share pain Yeah But essentially this is the me filling in the five if I were loom Still in this five above But like what you did here is a remote developer I want to show how a bagging on FS on my side You've mixed up the ibp Right, which is the purple one with the bug which is the feature with the benefit Which is the value prop so you've done all three in your one and I'm saying We just want one example for each column not confusing people  Yeah, I just show those three in column two, it's not just column two, it's column one, two, one, two, three.

1:49:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So okay. So your suggestion is just that we use a more generic way like then record the video.

1:49:29 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Well, I did the same as yours, but look, mine is color coded and mapped to the framework. I have the developer, I have the ICP, I have can't record the video, can't share bug problem.  You said I don't need to jump on a call. I guess there's a question here around, are they doing it such  They don't have to jump on a call, or are they doing it to share a bug or a problem in more detail?  Is it that they don't jump on a call? it that they communicate async to multiple people? I think it's, it's not the same thing, but it's close enough to be a problem happening.

1:50:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but can't share or bug the problem?

1:50:22 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Isn't that the user pain point? That they need to share the bug or the problem? I guess what you're saying is That's what they can.  I think what this presents is an interesting question about what's the alternative? I don't know if it's worth including that in a framework.  Is it necessary to articulate the alternative?

1:50:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Alternative to our product? Well, product feature. I think for this kind of workshop, no, but I would see that for a longer thing, maybe it makes sense, yes.  even the decisions for the IPP are not made in a vacuum, right? They're always considering alternatives.

1:51:05 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes. So, okay, let's do that. I don't need to jump on a call. That's a pink one. And then you did it.  I want to show how a bag on the first of my side, esync. So, I said, yeah. So, okay, so I just pasted your ones.  I'm going to delete yours. How does this look what I've done? Does that make sense now?

1:51:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's likely different because I believe the IPP is not developer unless we're talking about PLGs and developer advocacy kind of companies, which could be the case.  But I think that's a very specific case. So, the fact that there's an actor in the phrase does not mean that the actor is the same actor as the decision-maker, versus the decision-maker on hiring the Loom corporate thing might be the CTO.  That's for reasons of efficiency, right? But not necessarily to avoid him himself being on the call.

1:52:13 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So what you've now introduced is this. Yeah. So the developer would be the user buyer, I suppose. Yes, but that's, I think it's important not to confuse the buying committee.  I think the buying committee needs to be tied to ICP. But not IBP. So I think we do need the subset of the functions as an additional column tied to ICP.  Okay.

1:53:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What happens if we don't? What happens if we don't do it?

1:53:13 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Then you tell me, said developer and I said developer and you said the developer is the user, but what about the other people?  How do you feel now that you don't have clarity over the relationship with the blind committee with the context of defining the problem, the benefit?  Are you happy with it or do you feel like you need to define the buyer committee?

1:53:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I feel I need to define the buyer committee, but the user is here, right, and the decision maker is here.  So my... No. No? No.

1:53:55 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think you're making a very interesting question, very interesting observation. It depends on how you sell. So if you sell enterprise with a sales led motion, you're correct with what you just said.  If you do a product led motion, then you use a buyer as the I.B.P. is correct. So one that needs me to ask is, maybe what we need is a water flow, a waterfall, I don't know what I'm trying to say.  Maybe what we need is a decision tree with a few questions to go how to decide what the I.B.P.  is to define the I.B.P. So you're defining the feature, you know this. You're defining the pain point, know this.  You're defining the benefit, you know this. ICP, you may need to get data or make hypothesis or projection. You probably need to better define it.  So we need to take you through the definition, through the process to define ICP, which we haven't talked about.  But then we have to take you through the process to define I.B.P. In IVP, the first step is, what is it?  Who are you selling to? The economic buyer, the decision maker? Are you selling to the user? Because you're only going to send to those two.  You don't sell to a technical buyer and you don't sell to the product champion typically. Usually the user buyer and the product champion could be the same person.  So you probably buy to one of those two personas and then you decide which one. And then you just decline that and that's a tag that's associated with the persona here.  So we'll just have a tag, it's a little box that just goes to the function and the user buyer.  And it could be that you have a few different IBPs with this or it could be you have the same ICP and somehow you've magically sold to user buyers and economic buyers.  So you'd end up with all like two rows of the same color. but your purple would be a different job title with a different buying committee role.  So this goes together and then we bundle them. What do you think?

1:56:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So processing. So if I understand correctly, this thing forks into two, right?

1:56:23 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Sorry. Yeah, I don't think I'll do it in here. I'll do it in a separate space because I think it's gonna- Yeah, just conceptually.

1:56:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  there's two. Yes. So this means that we need an exercise on the fifth thing. Yeah. Either an exercise or a decision point.

1:56:45 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  We need an exercise in the ICP one as well. Because if you look at the matrix, the spreadsheet,-hmm. You know, there's an exclusion criteria.  And when you start excluding, you're going through a narrow ring.

1:56:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1:57:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I mean, ICP definition is typically harder than IBP, because once you narrow down ICP, becomes a lot clearer who the IBP is, but narrowing down the number of accounts out there, the focus is really challenging.  So, ICP has its own matrix, and then IBP has a basic matrix.

1:57:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, just conscious of time, my friend, because we said 6 p.m.

1:57:25 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I need to go buy cake for my partner for her birthday. Yeah, I reckon our scope of work was for the three workshops.  I think it was for...

1:57:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we have one more?

1:57:37 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I believe so, I can check.

1:57:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's fine.

1:57:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah, I mean, obviously, if it isn't, so, you know, happy to continue, you know, continue our engagement, finish this together, and get to the point, you know, however many workshops it takes for us to do it.  I'm very happy with the progress. I think it's really good to get clarity over what I'm selling. I think it's very hard to produce this.  time and energy and cognitive load but I think it's going to be proprietary and distinct and I'm very excited about it and I think even if even if it didn't work as a workshop for whatever reason or I failed to sell it as a workshop for whatever reason or it proved too complicated to deliver as a workshop I would still end up with proprietary firmworks I can deliver to clients and sell them so I'm happy about the output of this regardless of if we managed to make a workshop out of it.

1:58:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you it's very kind of you to say that so okay our has the boards a little bit better let's meet next week and we'll be doing what we're doing now which is converting the questions into exercises so then we have like the assets for the exercises that can't really answer.  Okay do you need to share the spreadsheet with you? Please do send it by email just so I have it and there's no yeah please do.

1:59:19 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'll put it here on the chat box.

1:59:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it DotLan?

1:59:27 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I'll contact, that's why I got it. ICP, IBP, Gsheets. I mean the problem with the Gsheets is to copy from a course that I did of someone else's.  So I'm not sure.

1:59:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you send me what you feel comfortable with or what.

1:59:46 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  No, that's not my problem. The problem is can I just take the spreadsheet from a work from someone else's course I did and use it as if it's my own from my own workshop.  That's the questionable reputation. I agree.

2:00:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would not use it one-to-one. So just set it. We'll have it as a resource on our MISM plus and then we decide on how to use it but we are mindful of the fact that this is not ours to begin with.

2:00:18 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yeah but to be honest a lot of this is generic. I think there's a few things I could move out of it to make it unique and modify it.  So I think I can just modify it to make it a bit unique and then we're fine.

2:00:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

2:00:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's quite generic.

2:00:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah the generic stuff is useful so it's good. So I don't want to hold you since you have like a life or death kind of situation with a cake.

2:01:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So he said he's happy for me to use it as long as I credit him and include a link.  You know what he said to me at the end?

2:01:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He said we'd love to join the workshop too.

2:01:17 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I've been talking about ICP and Percent as a lot recently.

2:01:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Boom. But it's kind of funny because he's already...

2:01:29 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  How does that make you feel?

2:01:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes me feel...

2:01:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  It's like what Liam said. He's like, I'll join this. It's like this perennial problem that people have that they're not clear who to sell to.  And it makes me wonder how is it that a guy who created a G-sheet that has ICP and ABP as a criteria?

2:02:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's an interesting thing for you to explore. Explore with him if you can, if you want. Why does this appeal to him?  Is it the content? Is it the format? Is it the idea of doing it with someone else? Is it the access to your expertise?  Like, maybe there's... Can you give me the list you just said?

2:02:19 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Access to your expertise? Oh, I'll pull it from the is it the format?

2:02:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it doing it in a group? Is it for intelligent gathering purposes like he wants to do its own?  Is it because he will be doing it with you and other people? Like, why is interested in this? It's an interesting thing to isolate.

2:02:45 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay, access to expertise, format. Doing it in a group, intelligence gathering, want to do your own. Struggling to define your own, but easy for you to do it for others?  Something else? Yes, yes, yes, yes. that's a good one yeah those are the ones that basically just why figure out why why why did he get this reaction also from Liam probably from Liam you can approximate because you're interacting more but I think the why is really relative to we had a call you said you'd want to do I see ICP I B P workshop for yourself what's what's the reasoning as you are is is doing this workshop for for you interesting do you also feel for me yeah like do you kind of go oh yeah I'd love to do this workshop too kind of but the reasons why I'm not saying hearty

2:04:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Is that I feel that this is probably geared towards people that have more data and companies. And I think it's probably different.  And also the fact that I've seen it come together takes away a bit of the, it's funny. I know it's rigorous because I've seen it come together.  But at the same time, there's this aspect of not knowing how a magic trick is done that I think is really valuable for this sort of thing.  Yeah, I think that's why my question is, my answer is kind of a maybe, but maybe this was not very.

2:04:40 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Polite and maybe too,  polite. I don't care about polite. I care about truth, truthfulness, as hard as it. As hard as it, because like, know, the world is unrelentling with its,  rather like, no, rather than, you know, continue to operate in the dark as a ambiguity. It's just, you know, and then it's fine.  It's interesting what you're saying. I wonder if it's, do you feel, let me just ask you a quote, do you feel you're clear on your ICP and IBP?  Not really, I would say maybe 70, 75 per cents. 75 is pretty high actually. Maybe it's because it's quite high that you don't feel it.  That would be my, my underlying hypothesis. And this is what my client said. Yes, we would definitely have features that have more or less appeal to different ICPs and different IBPs.

2:05:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ICP, SSO is great for larger businesses.

2:05:39 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Some more than non-regulated don't care. Some care being able to change gift wrap. Others would only care about how the monthly invoicing works.  So even though I thought that hug don't have features are different, you can see that my client is saying that they do.

2:05:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it, yeah, it seems like now that we see this example, it seems very inevitable, like people will pay.  attention to different things, right? They interact with the product in different ways. Like, for instance, just in terms of the gifting, like just the fact that for some companies, their point of contact is probably HR, and for some models, it might be facilities, I don't know, or internal comms, this changes the dynamic and people pay a bit of attention to different things.  Seems intuitively coherent.

2:06:28 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  I think it's very relevant for software companies, this specific feature mapping component. That actually raises a really clear, obvious criteria for selection if I do don't SAS, as a result of that.  If you do not do SAS? Yes, because feature mapping is critical for SAS, because they have features. And not SAS, they have services, but services and features are not the same thing.

2:06:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'd have to replace it.

2:07:00 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  features or services you see.

2:07:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  True, also the language, the expression features is much more familiar to Sasty.

2:07:08 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Yes, yes, but it's really the same, but it's different because service is broader. Graphic design, okay, but your graphic design is that website, so is that, you know, the paperback.  But if I said I have a feature for sharing video through Chrome, you're not getting confused that's not ambiguous, features are ambiguous.  So features are far more concrete with the jobs to be done mapping, and services can be very broad, so you'd have to make out services into sub points and deliverables, and therefore I think it would be a different mapping concept.  Quite an interesting, yeah, mean the funny thing is I'm sure someone's already done what we're trying to do here, and already exists out there, so it's very interesting the process of proprietary and what the ad is at work and what's going to happen and how much of it I make public and how am I going to get ripped off and I don't know.  because I haven't invented these concepts. it's interesting. I actually saw VC the other day, offer the workshop, doing workshops on ICP for startups.  I think it's actually not an unpopular topic, this ICP-IBP topic. I think it's relatively popular, but it's definitely far more relevant to what I do.  So essentially on my talk, I was thinking about doing ICP-IBP on my talk, SESTOC, because then I could sell the workshop, but I don't feel comfortable enough that I've done enough of it too.  I don't have the stories, I don't have the war stories to confidently speak about transformation and clients as result.  Essentially this workshop is a valid date, essentially I need to run the workshop on multiple businesses and see an upside to then be able to produce a talk on it, right?  But it's a bit of a shame in here.

2:08:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the fact that the workshop acts as a bit of a cookie-cutty fire of services gives you more comparable data.  on the different engagements, right? If you have a workshop and people go through the workshop, even if they get slightly different results, the outputs are similar enough that it feels iterative and that you're accumulating expertise on that specific problem.  Yes, exactly.

2:09:16 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  So I think in the future, this workshop will be one of my primary talks to drive people into it, know, assuming we get people into the initial workshop and it's a success and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.  But assuming all of that positive, then future talks of mine will probably be on this topic. Yeah, yeah.

2:09:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is an engine to create authority. One hopes, one hopes. Yeah.

2:09:43 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Okay, my friend. when reaching out to Joanna to coordinate another time, we'll continue. I'm excited. Thank you so much.

2:09:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Likewise.

2:09:53 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Have a nice one.

2:09:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I enjoyed the birthday dinner.

2:09:56 - Oren Greenberg (Kurve Limited)
  Thanks so much.

2:09:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bye.
