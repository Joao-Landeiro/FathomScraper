1:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can hear you as well. It's great to see you. mean, I've been telling you about the things you've told me in our first conversation.  I mean, to my wife several times, to friends, a few times as well, and I've put it into practice.  There was this opportunity, somebody referred somebody to me, and I was like, you know what, I'm going to start getting the reps, putting the reps in, and so far we have 100% hit rate.  mean, try to be... one guy and got a sale. So really, really happy. Yeah. Everything I wrote down, like, uh, so I had my notes from our conversation and then I cleaned them up, made them like process.  And then I, for this specific person, I've prepared, like, a version of that for them. And I literally wrote, like, pause.  And then I wrote this, like, all the time everywhere. And so that worked really well. There were moments where I could feel myself trying to feel in the space, right?  And I remember your words. I'm like, I'm going to experiment with this false thing. I think I've used I'm not fully sure, but I think I've used the paper like, oh, it's what it told me.  So, so the pause in the paper. And yeah, I mean, I think the best thing about it was, for me, that it felt really honest, like the thing that we were talking about.  It doesn't feel, you know, And this person was somebody that was, I was. So, English question. I was referred to them or they were referred to me.  I would say this. They came to me. They called me said, somebody told me about you as well. Okay, so, okay.  No, I just go by instinct. it's like borrow and land right it takes it goes the other way around okay so they were referred to me yes is that I say they were referred to me now I was referred to them okay, okay so for me there was like an extra aspect of keeping this very you know I don't know proper like I didn't want to come across as  and manipulative in any way. And also because the person that referred me, they know that I'm still learning about this packaging stuff aspect.  So there was no point in me coming across. was trying to come across as like, been there than that.  So I went through the first conversation. How was it? So the first conversation, we followed the persuasive question I was asking, right?  And then I did that, like, I think I have a way of addressing this. Would you be interested? And it was very emphatic, which was great.  was like, yes, I would be very interested. Very encouraging for me. Yeah. And then I exactly what it told me, like, a week from now, at this time, can we do it?  And we got it, got it, got it I put something together. and I put something together, but not really a document for myself, but I didn't have a document to send it.  And we spoke about it. I've stated, like, I went through the whole thing, I said it my price, and then, like, I was about to say, can, you know, do it in installments.  I didn't say anything. was just holding it, and then he asked for the installments, and I was like, yeah, we can do that.
  ACTION ITEM: Create initial payment structure for future client engagements - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/iwvCGJV1MYwqfsTrYgjB9yFbkKEfxAxH?timestamp=394.9999  So, and then I told him, here's what's going to happen, and I'll send you a document. I had a document like 85% done, so I just finished it and send it to him.  I didn't get like an initial payment, but I'm okay with that. I can imagine, like, at the platinum level, you get that, but I'm comfortable right now.  So, I sent him the document, like, I guess sales collateral, right, like the proposal and I did structure it kind of in the way that we spoke So this is the thing.  This is my point of view on this. think we should focus on this. This is what you get all this stuff and Yeah, he he said yes to it and I was really I mean I was so happy.  This was really like a turn not the turn to keep it like a shift in my You know, even even self-esteem.  I think it's such an important skill. It's thank you so much. mean, yeah Yeah You Yeah. It feels that way.  Yeah. It feels that way. I mean, I can see a lot of, you know, kinks to iron out and everything, but it really feels that way.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let me open that email, no, no, no problem, just need to find it. I found it here, yeah, I have it in front of So share screen.
  ACTION ITEM: Refine fishing line for consulting product, focus on "first consulting product" for ex-corporate leaders - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/iwvCGJV1MYwqfsTrYgjB9yFbkKEfxAxH?timestamp=629.9999  Yeah, share. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.-hmm.-hmm. Mm-hmm.-hmm. I think these opportunities might be too specific for now, so I think we can do the financial workable list.  I've been reading about the fishing line, so I think I get it a I definitely should have done it.  So, that's really difficult for me. So, I'll talk to you about, because I have no structure for this, I talked to you about this.  So, one of the things I've been thinking about was just describing kind of what I do and how it applies directly to what they do, example, I help, you know, consult with this product guys.  And then I was thinking that maybe this is me just over-complicating things but then I was thinking just oh why do they want to you know product types oh maybe they want more structure and their engagements or they want to be able to explain their complex expertise to other people like the pain point right and I've been this is if you can kind of my dilemma so part of me is like I help consultants productize and the other one is like oh I should just say I help you sell more of your complex expertise and then you know yeah I'll just pause now okay you  Yeah, okay, so basically, sorry, did I interrupt you, I don't know if you had something else. Okay, okay, okay, cool.  So this relates, I guess that I can change the fishing line, right? Yeah, so this client, these new clients, they are in the situation which I found  A lot of people to be in because I'm part of a community that has a lot of this profile, which is like a bit of an older guy that, you know, had like kind of leadership positions, they're really clever, they're used to having a good salary and so on, and then they left a corporate world and they want to shift into becoming like independent consultants, right?  But the thing is they have no idea on what to sell. And what I sold this guy is like my first consulting product.  That's like the name of the package, my first consulting product. And I'm guessing there's something there like I help, you know, consultants get their first consulting product, something like that.  Okay, okay, Thank you. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.-hmm.-hmm. To me, it's like my immediate opportunities are less about the area of knowledge and any more about the phase in their life.  No, no, I think that's better. I agree with you. think that's better. Yeah. think that's better. My struggle. Go ahead.  Correct, yes. I agree with that. I think my, so yeah, I agree with that. Absolutely. now my dilemma is currently in the context I am right now, there seems to be a pool of opportunity around this thing that I said that is more related to age or moment of phase of their lives.  But I agree that if I find some industry or some role or a combo of this, then like there's much more nuance and granularity, me speaking the lingo, the examples I have and stuff like that, I think it's really powerful, right?  I don't have that right now and I would like to avoid the innovation people. I would like to not work for innovation people.  Okay. You Yes, first sentence you said, cool. And then we cluster it, right? Okay. Okay, okay. No, no, no.  I have this thing up here. So, let me just, yeah, yes, okay, so this is my wife, this guy, yeah, she would, this guy, but I have this like kind of non-compete thing because most of her network is around the corporate compliance, she doesn't ask me to do this, but I don't want to serve other corporate compliance companies.  This guy, I don't know who he is, but I don't know why he's ordered like this. This comes from a coaching course I took and there's quite a few like first-time coaches or people becoming coaches.
