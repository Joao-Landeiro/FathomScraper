  Look who it is. I'm on mute right now.

0:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good to see you. Good to see you too.

0:16 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Really good to see you too. I can't remember when was like the last time we spoke. When would that have been?  I think it was like three months ago. Yeah, maybe more. More?

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, maybe more.

0:31 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  more.

0:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because now we are entering the third month of this year. feel like it was September or something last year, maybe.  Sorry. Closing down there. Wow. What's been happening?

0:53 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What's been happening?

0:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's It never feels like enough. But

1:02 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I did that.

1:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I did that. LinkedIn posts every business day. I'm doing it now, but I think I'll stop it after I finish my own commitment to myself.  LinkedIn is a bit... what was the commitment?

1:18 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  how many days? Like every business day for a quarter. For a quarter, okay.

1:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, actually I'm just keeping it up with it for myself at this point. It's just like, yeah, I want to build that muscle of doing boring things.

1:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That's the way to do it as well is like do it for you, not for like trying to find an audience or win that.  It's just about exactly like going to the content gym and building the content muscle. And I've seen some of your stuff.  You actually blew my mind the other day. Because I was like, oh my god, this is exactly what I've been thinking about, which is that the parallels between a premium professional service business and a luxury brand, there's like a very strong overlap there actually.  And you had a video of like, I was like a diamond in the sand, and I was like, yeah, I took notes.  I was like, yeah. is smart. Nobody else was talking about it like this. I'm like, this is exactly what I've been thinking.  And then it was, and you just, you just populated it with like more depth and sophistication than I had arrived at.  And it was awesome.

2:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. It was very kind of you to say that and speaking of content that blew everyone's minds was feeling the ripples of that.  That carousel was interesting. Like people, I thought about, oh, I should send this to this guy and then they just pop up in the comments and like, yeah, it's in it for sure.  Yeah.

3:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, that was cool. That was a good one that kind of had the impact I wanted it to. I was like, this was a conversation we need to be having.  We're overdue for this. And yeah, it worked great. A bunch of clients and podcasts, interview things and yeah, it's been awesome.  Nice, nice.

3:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm happy for you. was so funny because I sent it a message like a day before and it said, yeah, I think it's going to flop just being cheeky about it.  And then yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:32 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Because when you've been working on one thing for so long, it's like, I just need to get this out of my brain and just into the and I don't care what happens anymore.  But people found it interesting.

3:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, you know, you have, you have like, it is very consistent, you know, you know, you have this finding, oh yeah, of course, but which is like the thing, the golden grail.  Um, but it was interesting to hear you or to see you say that you had been working on that for a while because Uh, I think part of what makes the content thing a bit discouraging at times is that you see your own like Time you spend on things, but you don't see the time other people spend on things And it's very so much like you have people that spend Five minutes and people that really put the time in and it was very ah, okay.  Yeah He's been working on this for a while.

4:30 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's not just because it's Like Is the good at ungrading content which it's always reassuring totally totally and all the all the the The growth gurus and grift is we'll tell you like to We're sitting all the time and every day and three times a week or whatever and it's just like that's such a it's And and they want it they want to make it look as easy as possible  So that so that you can kind of do it too. And if you and when you do a  up or it doesn't work Like what you're just not pushing up.  They can shift the blame back on you The same thing is why they tell you that you need to be posting every single day Because as soon as you like miss a day then you That it's not that their program didn't work.  It's that you didn't You didn't stick to their program as strictly as you should have and if you had well, then you would have worked It's just it's a grip.  It's a total grip but the One of the 48 laws of power Is like always make it look easy So Yeah, I get it.  So don't tell anybody that that I find it hard No Um, yeah, never will never but Okay, so I want to be helpful.  You told me that it's something that that was in your mind and yeah, I mean, yeah, what I'm would love to get your thoughts, because yeah, seeing your content pop up on like, damn, we're like sharing the same wavelengths.  And what I'm finding is that like, what I really need is what I've been doing is essentially being like, cool, here is what I do.  Here is the big price tag. Are you in or are you up? And I know that I would get more yeses if I just re-packaged that a little bit.  And so what I'd let what I have been trying do around with is some kind of like intro offer.  Do I take the first workshop that I do, make that like a really like low, easy to say used to price point and then that can serve as credit for the full thing?  Or should it, should there be a whole different for that I'm putting together that could be that low cost trust builder that makes the bigger price tag very justifiable.  And I've got some thoughts on what that would look like. I'm actually in the process of like overhauling my entire process.  And if you want to see the rough draft of that, I'd love to show you as well.

7:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'd love to see it, yes.

7:55 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  But yeah, what are your thoughts?

8:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Other people have come to me to talk about this, and it's a trust-building thing, right? And I think it relates even more to the, it's a luxury, but it's not famous yet to be sold on that height, it's just on notoriety.  And one of things I've been thinking about is, okay, so you get like a, I used to call it like the Taster Workshop, I've seen other people call it other things, but we're talking about the same thing, low cost or things that, and the tension for me is that, like, can it be cheap, but not poison the rest of the relationship in a way that they're like, I think you need to It to be cheap, but still.  relatively expensive. So I'm jamming with you, right? So it shouldn't be for sure like a $20 checklist thing that's obvious.  And one of the things I've been thinking about also is can it be a simple thing, but there's an element of physicality, like something people get in the mail.  Like today I'll be visiting like a premium printer because I'm really convinced that's about to be the next arena for premium stuff like you actually getting things that's not glossy paper.  It's very interesting.

10:01 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Toby, what's your thought process at?

10:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so do you know how MaxTrailer says that the software marketing is for the marketing for professional services, because people follow the advice of the HubSpot guys?  Totally.

10:19 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, so I think it's a little bit like that.

10:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we think that we should be marketing on LinkedIn and stuff like that. But of course, that's a losing game, right?  Because as more people get in, the attention doesn't expand as much as the amount of things to see expense.  So I'm thinking like to cut through that and just arrive at people's doorsteps literally. So we need things that people.  Is that like that meme in the past? You got you got mail and you got an email. We are the same age, I think.  So remember this. Oh, I got an email. That was amazing. And then it's reversed, right?

10:53 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Oh, I got mail, right?

10:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So I think there's something there. And then then you have like daggers of things and maybe I can show you something I've like been so okay before I open like a lot of loops.  I think you understand the logic of what I'm saying but I don't know if I went too much on a tangent.  So what I'm thinking is like okay so and I'm really fascinated by these which are like physical products that relate to intellectual capital right.  I think books are a good example of that of course. But they're also a little bit overplayed. But then there are other things and this is like my nerd zone so please interrupt me if you feel like I'm just...

11:47 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I refuse.

11:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. So let me share my screen with you. Okay you should be seeing my screen now. So, what I'm thinking is, is it at a good zoom level?  Yeah.

12:09 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Okay.

12:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, and maybe not all brands relate to this, but there's many ways of doing this. so, these are like pocket calculators.  I love the vibe of library cards and stuff like that. I don't know what to do with it. I love the sort of thing you put in your, I love the idea of mementos and coins, like the alcoholics anonymous coins.  This thing, I think it's cool. So at this point, most of these things are like symbolic and really, really low on practical, right?  So I don't think people should want to pay for this. This is just like a season. for the relationship like oh yeah Alex really gets it right and then we enter things that I think are a little bit more premium which are which are like brand kids that stores receive this is not easy to start sending people red especially from Australia and for me on the on the on the visual frameworks I think this sort of thing is also very interesting and relatively easy to make just need a laser cutter another coin yeah yeah yeah I think maybe for for you I would go if we're talking about things physical things yeah I think for you I would go for something that is very easy that is for the starting point right texture for sure so I think it's I think it's paper and I should I think it could be related to like a transformation  that the person goes through, So I think this sort of thing, and I don't know how easy it is to produce this, but this is like an advent calendar, right?  Or something that people can interact over a period of time and they evolve through that thing, right?

14:20 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Are you seeing this as like part of the delivery or as a physical lead magnet, basically?

14:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's kind of both, but that's a very good distinction. I think it's kind of both. So the way I would separate it is how integrated it is, right?  So if it were a lead magnet, it needs to be cheap and like inviting in terms of curiosity, I think.  If it is part of a process, then it's a little bit more involved, like, I don't know, something like this maybe, you know.  But, but we might be so sure, this is just like inspiration. I like this stuff.

15:08 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I like it. I like it too. like it too.

15:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it, I think the, I'll think out loud for a second.

15:19 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  The, the thing about, I was like the lead generation tool. That's just like it.

15:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

15:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's kind of, it's a lot better than, than a, than a cold DM, right? Called email. But is it still in the same category in a lot of ways of like, look how much effort I'm going through to reach out to you and kind of indirectly.  Thanks for watching.

16:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking for this for myself and Yes, there's always an aspect of people can interpret that as begging for gifts.  I think that One of the things I was thinking about just sending people a key right a note and a key And and then see if they enter the link that I put in with their own Name right to see if they're they're willing to open a conversation because It's just a curiosity thing right a clickbait thing So for instance, uh, I think it was Uh bcg boston consulting group that started we were sending letters to  Presidents that in American companies they would send letters and little books booklets made to fit in their pockets. I Couldn't find pictures of this as Like hey, this is what's happening in your industry and I Have these thoughts on this of course like the average Purchase would be higher and they would you know, there's a whole set of things around that But I think they positioned themselves as like hey, I know this stuff.  I'm being useful here There you go. So people I think were like looking forward to it and well they became BCG and There's more on that like I don't know if they don't know the book words of strategy is like all those companies came to be Never read it, but I know it I mean It's worth to to flick through it, but I don't know if that's I think for me was more interesting because I had the fascination  Like, oh, I should have gotten into this stuff before, now I need to build the credibility without those big names, and I think that was how I approached it.  But yeah, if your reading list is too long, maybe don't need to do it. But that's something that stuck with me from that.  Like, they did that thing, right? But I think maybe we are viewing a little bit of drag here. So the idea is...  I like the key idea.

18:31 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  A key with a note. It's impossible not to be curious about that, at least. And hey, maybe we should talk to this guy.  Yeah, I get it a lot.

18:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And yeah, I think what's an inspiration for me is that movie, The Game. Did we speak about that? Michael Douglas gets a package from  brother uh-huh from the 90s i didn't even know it i might like it okay i mean it's this world building right so and i think that's the way i've been thinking about this stuff yeah yeah yeah that's a good frame um but so this is all very exciting and i love talking about this but you said that you were thinking about um like the low cost trust builder right and what makes you think that what what makes you feel the need for that because what triggered it i think i just i got i got a ton of a lot of good yeses recently got a couple of nose that felt like they

20:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  should have been yeses. They were shrewd. And I was like, ah, you just don't. And this is the trap of content is that, you know, you can create something really good and really powerful that people really respond to, and they'll reach out and they'll want to have a chat.  But there's a difference between consuming someone's content for six months versus consuming one post, even if that post was really, good.  And so, and so it's like, ah, cool. If you were just kind of understood being in my brain on my wave for longer, this would have been an easy yes, because you're a good fit.  I like it would work. And so I was like, okay, I think it was just really like that big price tag at the front end that was undercutting and sabotaging that.  And so to your point, which I think very astute is that like you've got to make it cheap that it's like doable but not so cheap that it undermines you and that or like you know anchors you down basically to that price because if I because even you know even if I'm like cool we'll just call the first workshop a thousand dollars flat and then you can pay the next uh nine thousand dollars um you know for the next two workshops after that uh even that thousand dollars flat feels like it potentially an undercut I don't know but I could be overthinking it as well what do you suppose uh I don't know if I don't know I don't have enough information to know that this is not a qualifying thing maybe it is not a product development thing true yeah  Well, I mean, it's kind of like the feedback that I get, they reach out, they understand the position, they want somebody to help go through the sales kind of process, ask good questions, show good examples, they get it, they get it, and it does seem to be the price that is like the handbrake.  But I think it's a fair price, isn't it? I don't want to lower it, but I do want that, I just want to easier unwrap onto it.  Because I also know that after that first workshop, it's just a-ha moments flying out all the time, like it's very, very impactful.  And what I often see is like, I'll- you know, I'll sell to the founder and then they'll bring in the team or I'll sell to someone on the team.  They'll bring in like a larger team for the workshops. And a lot of those people who get brought in will be very, very skeptical.  And like why, why, why are you wasting my time? Like, why am I on this call? And then after that first workshop, like, there's a flip that happens.  There's a switch and everybody's really, bought in. And so I am thinking like that does feel like it should potentially be a sales tool in a way like that they pay for, but just at a lower rate.  But I'm so concerned about undermining my premium position and like, yeah, accidentally sabotaging how I'm perceived.

23:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. I closed the tab so we wouldn't be constantly thinking about physical things.

24:01 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  How many of these guys did you get like how many do you have like an idea of the proportion of the kind of like good fake clients that just couldn't that could afford me but couldn't quite get out of the hurdle three that I can think of yeah and and you are convinced that it was the price because that's when they stopped talking they just said oh thank you and disappeared well that's when they were like that price it's just a price they were like explicitly like fully get it fully on board this makes sense you know you can tell from body language like yeah and it's just the price that was the that was like the handbrake it's so it could be that I am charging too high and that could be the other thing but it's still either way like it is it is a you know I am charging $10,000  three workshops, three two-and-a-half hour workshops. Maybe that is too high. I mean, some people do say yes to it.  And maybe that is just a qualifier, like a good fit client would say yes to that. But it does feel like they would pay that.

25:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If they had seen you do the first thing.

25:26 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  If they had seen the experience of value, yeah.

25:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm opening your LinkedIn page right now.

25:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What are you looking for?

25:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, because try to see your page as I never spoke to you, right?

26:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Thank you. Yeah.

26:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

26:02 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah. Well, yeah, okay. The fact that I'm immediate like seizing up.

26:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but I understand that.

26:12 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's been dated to me, you know. Everyone would do that.

26:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would chill the same way if you told me, wait a minute, let me look at your link. So what I'm thinking immediately is I'm far from a LinkedIn expert.  But what I'm thinking immediately is that, I mean, there's a lot of, if I think about like a bouquet of convincing arguments, your bouquet is heavily, it leans heavily on like, you say clever stuff in tasteful ways, right?  You're good at that. But I don't see then, like, people talking about it, like the testimonials or stuff like that.  And I think if it's a trust thing, maybe those things would help. But yeah, I mean, it's good that that's the nugget of what I'm saying.  Maybe those things would help with the trust thing without you having to develop like a product for it. But I also feel related to that luxury thing that, you know, luxury brands don't have testimonials.  just did they're just that good, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think an interesting point that I don't have is what's the closing rate for like premium services?  Maybe they just assume like we close like only 20% of people that contact us? Yeah, yeah.

27:46 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And that's actually I work with a business coach. He was like, what's your clothes? And this is when I was a lot cheaper.  I was very proud. was like, oh, 90%. And he was like, that's horrible. Oh my God. You should be ashamed of yourself.

28:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He's like, you should be aiming for 20%.

28:11 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  You should be aiming for 20%. I was like, oh my God. That like broke my brain, but I think it's correct.  So yeah, so yeah. And to be fair, my close rate probably is around 20% right now. But I just hate like leaving like good fit clients soon.  Like I know I could add so much value and that would be a fun project and I know it'll be great.  If we could just get this hurdle because it's like a price tag that they can afford. yeah, it's exactly.  It's just like that trust thing. hasn't been fully built yet. And I'm trying to basically find shortcuts for it.  I guess that's actually what it boils down to. I'm trying to shortcut trust. And if I just get in the room, it becomes a no brainer, but there's positioning implications.

29:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're very charismatic, so you might be used to this feeling of like, yeah, once people talk to they want it, they'll want it, right, and maybe there are some aspects of it that they are not within your, you know, office of control, so.

29:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, it's a big assumption on my part that like, if they get the first workshop they'll want the rest, I don't know that, I've got no data to back that up.

29:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that was not my angle, my angle was like, if you have a hammer everything looks like a nail, like, no, you are good at, you know, this talking and showing people that you have a process and coming up with things.  on the fly and reacting to things. maybe if you were a mute, a mute person, maybe you would lean harder on your writing, right?  I thought your writing is very good, but you get my point, like you have this asset and maybe you think like, oh, if we just bring this interaction into my arena, then I'll close, right?  But maybe that interaction will never happen on that charisma arena.

30:31 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's just a different thing.

30:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the point is that I'm trying to convince you not to go into product development mode at this point, not for those reasons.  I mean, if it's cool and if it's something you want to do and you want to have it and send it to people, okay, cool.  But I'm not sure you have, what's the word for that? You know, spend all the other avenues that could be faster and also cheaper.  Not as fun, but faster and also cheaper, so Yeah, if this is a qualifying thing, maybe it is a qualifying thing if it is a trust-building thing How could we for instance if it is a trust-building thing if the problem is trust-building There are many solutions to that right and one of them is like add that guy to your CRM and send him a book not your book some book later with a Like a mark on the chapter like a Disney made me think of you No, and you don't need to develop anything for that, but this is really a high-level relationship building You live on an island, so I think that makes all those things a little bit more logistically complex Yeah, yeah But but the idea of the CRM of  like finding a system that you every now and then oh there was that guy because at this scale right if I understand correctly like you are a premium service you're not dealing with hundreds of clients right no so if we shift this from building that that relationship and there's like different ways of doing that this made me think of you I wrote this thing I think it relates to your this kind of thing is cheaper right also easier to iterate on better than you just developing something that it's done and then you will see if it works right I don't know am I shooting I mean I'm really trying to I don't want to come across as difficult it's just like I feel that there's things you have at your disposal that maybe you could explore yeah I really appreciate it I'm definitely a horrible

33:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Follow-up or like I don't I just I just don't And I think this is why I like content so much is you come to me Nominate that you interested in working with me ideally really I I'm the one auditioning you like are you a good fit for me?  and Yeah, I think I just have such a I don't know why such an aversion such an aversion to Unprompted reach outs in any capacity because it feels Potentially it could be read as desperation and That's the quickest way to undermine The premium positioning

34:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could you frame it as, I get that, could you frame, because there are many different ways of doing that sort of unprompted outreach, right?  There's, hey, how are you doing? remember that you spoke, no, maybe you're ready now. No, this is bad, I think.  But then there's like, I love this sentence, like game, recognize game, you just send them stuff that, yeah, Alex is one of us, right?  Yeah, yeah. And on that thing, if it is content, if it is a link to a thing, there's so much amplitude, so much space to explore that, oh, for this guy, it would be an article of a report, like for instance, like this is easy alpha.  theoretically, it's hard to keep up with these things. The guy seems to be, oh my god, on the verge of it, but then they don't do it, right?  And then just take that conversation and throw it at, I don't know, perplexity or whatever, and say, find me, what are industry publications that this guy would find interesting?  OK, and then you get those publications. And then later, Justin, oh, by the way, I was searching for something.  This came up, you might like it, something like that. And I think that's a different tone from the other one, which is like, we are peers and I get you and I'm being useful and I don't even care to sell you something.  I think you'll just like this. And I don't know, I think that's a possible avenue.

35:44 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I think so too, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so too. I like that. That's smart. Did you come up with that?  Take the transcript of the call and then get perplexity to find relevant articles.

36:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  thing that people do I asked for relevant industry reports most for myself and to find ways of talking about pain points but I haven't tried this I spoke with conviction right I haven't tried this directly that's like a brilliant like don't don't leak that everybody on LinkedIn will start doing it if you get that out yeah it's our secret but in itself is a little bit matter right because by me sharing the thing you're like oh my god this guy gets it and that's what you'll be doing by sharing the other things that right for sure for sure and game recognized game is such a real thing like the easiest people to sell to people who sell because they can see you do all the tricks and they'll appreciate and respect you more for doing the sales stuff rather than trying to navigate around it it works on me all the time I buy stuff if someone just does a good job of selling it to me

37:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Like, I don't want it, but it solves it.

37:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's such an interesting frame, because I think I overindexed on trying to be sneaky. And this explains all my struggles in adolescence in trying to get girlfriends.  anyway, basically the idea is that's cheap, but it doesn't feel cheap. It's cheap because you're leveraging free AI. a lot of people are not leveraging free AI.  And I think it sets a different tone for future conversations. And probably you can send the same thing to different people, right?

  And then you can...

37:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  share this with you.

37:45 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  This is a follow-up activity that has worked wonders for me, which is at the start of the... Or when it's coming to the end of the month, or whatever time, you can always find a relevant thing.  I'll just send an email. that to the people who are on the Navy's list or have kind of stalled out in the sales process.  And I'll say, hey Jack, just locking in my schedule for the next month, still had a question mark next to your name, should I cross you off the list, or are you still interested in maybe working together?  Or could either way just let me know so I can figure out my schedule. I swear to God, eight times out of ten they'll come back and be like, oh no, they'll reply quickly.  No, no, no, please don't cross me off the list, just getting ducks on the side kind of thing. Let me know what the next steps are.  It's very powerful and it keeps the balance of power on your side. You're like, I'm just about let go of the rope, you're on the cliff side, I'm about to let go, should I let go?  Jack, I'm gonna let go. It works on this.

38:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, so this would dovetail into your process right now. What do you do to track this stuff? Just your head?  Sure, bring it on.

39:13 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I don't have that many clients at any one time or at any one time that I need to. But do you have a routine?

39:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is there a space in your agenda to do this? Do you have a piece of paper where I write this stuff?  I would need to not get lost. You wouldn't think so.

39:32 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I literally, just my brain will conjure a memory and I'd be like, oh, I should pull up. Oh, .

39:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like three weeks ago, I started to like, I want to help.

39:42 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And then I just went to think it's so sloppy. No, good, good.

39:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I mean, in terms of, let's say, circle back a little bit. at the start of the conversation we were talking about maybe there's like a smaller offer that you could have that could get people a trust-building thing, but the tension there was not cheap in your brand and not change the anchor of the relationship and that kind of thing right yeah we floored it a little bit with outbound like not outbound but yeah just sending people stuff we floored it a little bit with that but that felt a little bit to me like I know it because I spent a lot of time doing that kind of thing a little bit like playing with Lego it feels like work but it's not really work or it's very easy to get off into non-work territory and like are there other things that we could do about this and then we spoke about qualifying we also spoke about no what's  acceptable rate and then finally we started going to this just keep them keep you on their minds as as a high-level you know advisor that gets them and is not begging for work and we've discussed like cheap ways of you to delivering really outsized value or as a searcher of things that's related to their world okay did i get it i'm gonna try the amazing recap i'm gonna try the the uh perplexity thing that's really clever it's really clever do you want me to share my screen you can show you always sometimes with yeah please did i interrupt you i got excited i'm sorry  Okay, so in your thread, I'm working with a potential client in the, what are the industries that most of your clients work in?

42:16 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  In the digital agency space?

42:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, it can be more detailed than this. And it will think for a while, the deep research thing is really impressive.  It will think for a while and it will bring you some industry reports. And the more, I guess it depends on your clients.  I think some clients will like the esoteric things that are difficult to find and some others will want to click baby things that are really easy to read.

43:30 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I don't know, but they'll keep thinking about it. Is this what, have you done this and seen success with it?

43:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not very structured, but I've sent, I do send things when I see people. I don't know if, no, I don't know if I've been very successful in this.  Yeah, because this is so in meshed with the way I work. I, I don't know. Well, if I have like a dedicated approach to this, like I see things and then I send it to people.  Yeah, I think I think my own choke point is more on the selling part. Like transform. I've noticed this before transforming one conversation into another part of conversation, which I think is where I usually mess up.  What do you mean?

44:23 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Can you give me more specifics?

44:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, sure. So it's you like this talking shop thing? Yeah, it comes naturally. I like it. And I think it builds trust, but I don't do it because it builds trust.  I do it because I'm having fun. And usually the point at which I my failure most is book ending these conversations and say, OK, so now you don't see my proposal and people are like, wait, what?  What are you talking about? know, so. and I understand that this could be a little bit meta given that I'm not trying to be sneaky about it.  But yeah, I noticed that that's my choke point. I think that once people talk to me, they often seem to find that, oh, I have interesting things to say, and whatever dryness of pipeline that can occasionally occur is more around that, converting from one type of conversation to the other type of conversation, which is great because Blair Ends just launched the book about the four conversations.

45:37 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  He did.

45:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He did. Have you read it? No, no.

45:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  But I listened to their podcast.

45:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:44 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I read the book and it's not as practical as you would believe it to believe, but yeah, okay. I mean, when you are like  setting a sales call, you setting an agenda up top or are you like what's the process?

46:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not consistently, no.

46:13 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Let me tell you what I did because like I did, I used to struggle with the same thing and so what I'll do is make sure I always always always set an agenda up top and that is as simple as, you know, we'll talk about the weather and then great.  Love to ask you a few questions, get a little bit more detail, fill in the gaps in my knowledge and then if it makes sense to do so I can share with you how I work, what the process is and we can talk about next steps if there's potentially, is that sound fair enough?  Great and then they give me, that gives, they've given me permission to like interrogate them and drill them for a bunch of info and I don't really have like a set kind of bank of questions  It normally starts with how do people find out about you, and then I use what they say to build deeper.  But there's a natural half-way point where it's like, okay, great. I think I have enough for now and then get that consent again.  Would you like to see how I work and what my process is? Then yes, and then I share my screen and go through it.  Just by setting the expectation upfront that will be part of today's conversation, it makes it very, very easy to set into it.  And then after you get to the end of your little spiel and pitch, then the next step is already teed up and it's not like a weird surprise out of my way.  Does that make sense? Yes, yes, it makes a lot of sense.

47:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the advice makes sense. And I've heard versions of it, but it was useful to see you say this now.  And I think what tends to kill me is that... as a lack of preparation or preparing for the wrong thing, preparing like, oh, I'll read their stuff.  So I'm like intellectually prepared, but I'm not emotionally prepared for it. Which is silly just listening to it, but I know we are silly beings.

48:17 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Your little trap card for yourself is that you love the work and you wanna like get stuck into like doing the work.  that first call is almost like a workshop in and of itself, right? You're like, oh my God, spit the link.  It is, what about this? What about this? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's like, that's not what they want, actually.

48:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Trap cards. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Save that for after they pay you, dude.

48:52 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That's the goal. Yeah. It also keeps a bit of the mystery alive of what they're paying for. Cause if you're just asking questions,  students and like nodding thoughtfully asking them slightly more insightful deeper question based on their answer oh interesting okay hmm something to think about let me show you how I work now it's like oh what is he thinking about he's the key the key exactly exactly uh so yeah yeah yeah and then that's and then then they have they have to unlock your solutions with my paying you they don't get free so oh this is like three levels of inception right now but what I what I was thinking was that I like to make paper notes and I was thinking like maybe I should have like a colored piece of paper different color and then and then people see that I make notes on the color piece of paper that's the key they're like what what is that oh that's paper right anyway sorry uh see how this goes on and on and on yeah yeah yeah I don't think that thing  close attention. But yeah, I see the theory. Maybe it's red. I read this a favor. Anyway, thank you for that.

50:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is useful. So let's see what they got us. Sometimes they hallucinate, right? You need to open running.

50:19 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  don't know.

50:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  These guys are big boys. Let's see what they say. This seems like a  site. not true. Oh, not paid.  Okay. I guess I guess you download the thing and send them the PDF right away, which is already high value, I suppose.

50:43 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Like, this is the page.

50:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  doesn't seem to be paid. Sure. Okay, yeah.

50:50 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, okay, cool. Um, yeah, okay.

50:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice.

50:55 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. Uh, okay, cool, cool. Yeah. And I'm going to, I'm going to for sure try that out and try some different forms and try and get some like the more like granular and like nitty gritty.  The reports are the more, the more valuable they become. Um, yeah. Okay. Cool. That's a good shout. That's a good shout.  Yeah. I'm going try it. We'll just see. Let's do a little test. Let's do a little test. Let's do a little testing.  Um, can I show you, and thank you by the way, but for, for your, for your thoughts and generous timing and coaching, I definitely like clarified a lot.  can I want to show you very messy, very messy initial kind of draft of my new, my new projects, my IP because essentially what I have been doing is kind of iterating a plus.  same process for the last several years. And it's really this perspective stuff that I wanted to really own. while I have kind of been incorporating it into my existing kind of process, it's turned into a bit of a Frankenstein monster.  so now I'm just like stripping all that screen learning and kind of blank-handling it and going, all right, let's let's  just get out like what are what are what are the exact things that we need to extract in order to make this work.  sorry, I'm just up to get get your thoughts on the flow and and does it make sense and is it compelling, are the concepts compelling?  Yeah, so essentially step one, in order to unpack your to extract your perspective, we need to isolate your differentiation.  We need to look at the list of competitors who you're literally losing work to, the ones that you're actually being compared against.  And we need to figure out, okay, well, what do you do that they don't, and what don't you do that they do?  Because the answer to those two questions will extract your meaningful tangible points of difference, not anything philosophical or fluffy or values based, like what do you actually do?  What are the workflows that are different to you versus anybody else? Then we're ask a very small but very important question, which is why why do you do those things that they don't, and why don't you do those things that they do?  And what this will give us is a list of opinions that we can start to then tease out and even begin to mildly stress test.  Because what we're really looking for is like the opinions that frustrate than the most, like what are the stuff that you want to like grab your clients by the shoulders?  Don't you see? Do you not see? That's stuff we want. And from there, and this is what I'm actually proud of, is like, okay cool, we can actually bucket these into a bit of a hierarchy around three categories.  So every perspective falls into one of these. It's either principle, playbook or practice. The new mindset that you need your market to adopt, the new model that you want your market to follow, the new tactics that you want your market to action, always be one of these three things.  I've tried to like find exceptions, I cannot. An example would be like a client that I worked with was like an organic social media marketing agency, and the co-founder said to me in one of the sessions, he was like, you know, everyone who follows you on social media on  be a potential client. They should be somebody who could buy from you one day. Not like big horror audiences.  We don't care about big numbers. Like that's a waste of time and space and dilutes everything. It harms a brand.  We want small, dense, high-intensity audiences. I was like, yes, actually that is spot on. And that's a killer perspective.  And then with a bit of copywriting magic that became don't count your followers, make your followers count. That's a principal perspective.  That's a mindset shift that they need to engineer into their market. And so once we kind of figure out, okay, well, what's the most potent perspective that we have here and where does it sit?  We also then want to look at the opposing force for each. And so the opposing force for principles is the belief.  Like, what is the false or outdated mindset that the market has and must abandon? What is the approach? What is the old model that they're following?  What is the tactic? What is the incorrect? and executed action, they must stop. Once we combine the either one of the P's, the playbook, the principle, the practice against the opposing force, that's a minimum viable perspective right there.  Here's what we stand, here's what we believe as opposed to this. The world should be like this, not like this.  This, not this. Now a fully robust perspective, it actually covers all three layers, but a minimum viable perspective, we just need to cover one.  From there, it's only at that point do we want to actually think about clients. And we want to make out the best ones.  And we do it by getting a list of every client that they've ever had, and we get great, let's just apply three filters through out of everyone you've serviced.  Did you get the biggest results for it? time frame with the least amount of resistance and whoever fits through those three criteria and always they can count on one hand your best clients will be that great let's say we've got four people that actually meet this criteria and can filter down what's the common thread between them we don't care about demographics demographics what we care about is what were they trying to achieve and what was stopping them from achieving those things mm-hmm I was on a call earlier today with someone that I've been mentoring and he's like but what about problems like why don't you talk about problems you know the problems that that sold sound like problems only exist if they've tried to solve them like people businesses have problems all the time that they have no interest in solving that's fine we're not going to convince them it's only the people who are trying to get the green up hostages but have experienced  roadblocks along the way. That's who we can actually get in front of and make a change for. So it's what they're trying to achieve and what we're stopping them.  From there, we can use a Perspective Plus client insights to generate some kind of introvert or something that can be the tip of the spear.  And what it boils down to is what the buyer wants that the company can deliver that the buyer cannot get elsewhere.  That's what the introvert needs to be. Then we can turn that into a proprietary framework, give it a name.  And then we can apply this to all the kind of key touch points in the final sales date front page in that sequence, whatever it needs to be.  And then once that is set up, you can just focus on the top of the file. And that can be ongoing or whatever.  But that is the process. Questions for you? of all, what's your reaction?

58:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The first The first thing I notice is that you have really interesting words, like rival is a great word, first rate is a great word, you know, principal, playbook, practice are really good words.  Okay, you're not surprised by this, but this really struck up. I think that perhaps, this is like, I need to think more about this, but perhaps this is too detailed, I think, maybe.  I know it doesn't feel like it for you, I suppose, but...

59:46 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Oh yeah, no, I mean, I wouldn't be putting this on like a sales poll, I think. Oh, okay, this is because this looks like your content, so I thought this was going to be content.

59:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, no, no, no.

59:56 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  This is just me digging the messy...

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  which is paper understood understood okay okay because you use canvas you're right board got it got it good yeah so that yeah that's different okay um yeah yeah i'm just trying to get the concepts down basically mm-hmm i like this i like the fact that it's um around action and not ideas or values around behavior right and not not values i like that um this one i think the the state it's difficult for me to look at this and not think that this is content because it looks so much like content but uh yeah but it makes sense to me i'll have something else to show you later but yes makes sense to me okay  opinions in three categories. Okay. Okay. This one maybe is not, it is a pyramid. I understand that there's a perspective that like when we talk about its ontology, it's a pyramid, but when we're talking about how to do it is not a pyramid, it's three columns.  And I think if you represent it in three columns, it's easier to understand what to do.

1:01:29 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like three equally based equally sized rectangles is all it needs to be. Yeah. Yeah.

1:01:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or even like from a content perspective, perspective, perhaps even more elegant is just like three columns with the headers and a little line between them.  Yeah. Principle and just that it gives you a feeling of, oh, this is our three lists. Yes, they relate to each other in a different way, but  saw this because that's the thing with very recognizable images. stop listening because we fill in blanks with our preconceptions.  When I saw this, I thought about the relationship between them. I didn't think about the process of filling this in.

1:02:18 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there is a relationship between them, right? This is like there is a hierarchy here.  And maybe that's okay, but I totally see, yeah, I totally see that kind of I really like how you put that.  see an image that you're familiar with and then your brain connects the dots, even if they're not necessarily the intended dots.

1:02:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this could be kind of the same thing, maybe just instead of the names at the top of the list, just the names at the bottom of the list.

1:03:01 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  something like that.

1:03:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know it heals you not to have like a alliteration for this. I know. know. it also shows it shows that this is sincere because the much alliteration feels fake, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, true.

1:03:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  So true. Yeah, although if I do find an alliteration one day, I will use it. Yeah, okay. At the bottom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then that can even just be one graphic almost of just like principle, belief, table, approach, practice.  Yeah, something like this, right?

1:03:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1:03:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What I was picturing.

1:03:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because then you can play around with arrows and forces, because they are forces, right? That's how you think about them.

1:03:56 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  They're opposing forces. Yeah, 100%.

1:03:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:03:59 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, not going to even be, oh, yeah, beautiful. It's a gradient there. OK, I'm going to zoom.  Where you go? Oh, there's this thing.

1:04:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh. read?

1:04:16 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What is that?

1:04:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you read?

1:04:18 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Oh, see. I'll see. Hold on.

1:04:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll stop sharing my screen for a second so that you become better.

1:04:25 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Or I could just pin you in that. what I should have done. OK, perform it. Oh, wait. Here we are.  No, not you. Hold on. Hold on. Keep holding it. Keep holding it. OK. Oh. a rotating economy and simplicity.  What is this? What am I looking at?

1:04:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Take a screenshot so I can lower my arms.

1:04:49 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I'm on it. Hold on. OK. Screenshot. Done. OK.

1:04:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. So this is the idea of the opposing. versus, right? And this is related to how constraints affect each other.  But this kind of representation, I think it's really elegant. You have, at one end, you have principle, and at the other end, have that belief, right?  And these things, they have a line between them, and if you put a plus or a minus between them, you say that they reinforce each other or they oppose each other.  Basically, I'm not trying to, because it took me a few pages to get to this, but there's this idea of the opposing forces, and I think opposing forces is a thread behind a lot of what you talk about.  Certainly, yeah, and that's exactly the language that I use, it's like these are opposing forces.

1:05:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Okay, nice, nice.

1:05:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You need to share it again.

1:05:51 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's popping up soon. I do think that there is something to be said for... hmm potentially need to find words that are more obviously opposing or like negative like belief is not necessarily like a negative to principle but that's that's a me problem but I just had that thought the same but yeah that would make it really tight for sure yeah yeah opinion maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah mean yeah I'm out of my depth here but if you have like opposing forces that start with OP that would be amazing yes yeah but they need to be yeah they need to speak to the status core essentially like what is the houseified mindset that is dragging everyone down okay cool let me be bigger  So then we have this framework, this is something that, this is kind of my secret weapon. I really hate demographics, I hate them so much.  You can't just like create a fictional character and be like, this is who we're going to sell to. You need to look at who values you the most already or has value in the past and I really do think that this is a criteria to assess that, who did you get the biggest results for in the shortest time frame with the least amount of resistance.  And the tricky word in there is resistance because that can be, there has been interpretations, that can be caste or internal politics or like how many hoops did you have to jump through, how many procurements did you have to have, how much resistance was there because that has like a net, that's another opposing force to your ability to enjoy the work, to deliver the work and enjoy the work as you're delivering it.

1:08:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it resistance like the opposite of, I don't know, fluidity or something like that? Yeah, totally.

1:08:34 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Do these criteria make sense to you? What does it feel like it's missing something?

1:08:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think they make sense if you always deliver the same thing. If you are more, like if you customize services,  I suppose some of your clients could do that. That's what I thought, because I don't usually do the same thing yet.  I want to get there, but that's not what I do. And when I do it, exercise like this. I've done this maybe two or three times for myself.  And it goes all over the place. Because for some people, it was really powerful that we just had a few conversations for others.  I need to put together a whole workshop. So at the end, it doesn't give me clarity because of the stage I'm in.  It doesn't give me clarity on where I should focus necessarily. Actually, it kind of looks like a series of Venn diagrams.  And I should pick one of them.

1:09:46 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Well, actually, this is a good opportunity. do you have like, can you think of two clients that you've had that meet this criteria, that meet all three of these criteria?

1:10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you like got them in your head Yeah, not really not to Really it's like it's that disparate It feels I mean the end result is not but the process see okay I can give you like concrete example So yeah, like it was very good to work with a client that did Psychedelic retreats and you want to like visual frameworks and workshops first You really got it.  He loved the stuff. He contacted me. It was a pleasure to work with fun guy You know amazing, but then Like the other project that at the biggest results was completely different not just because of it was not a Mexican guy Psychedelics it was like different idea like a workshop package  or NGO. So I think this speaks more of me than of your process. But that's how I felt about it.

1:11:11 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Well, okay, that NGO in psychedelics guy, what did they have in common? What were they both trying to achieve when you boil it down?

1:11:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They were both trying to get alignment at scale, so to say. They were trying to create experiences, disparate group would sink together.  I know what you mean.

1:11:46 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, they had to take totally disparate people who are not aligned, had never met and get everybody on the same page really quickly, really efficiently and really mutually, like there has to be depth to that alignment.  I not just go around and say a fun fact about yourself, they have to connect in order for this to work.  And so what was stopping them from doing that to date? Like, what have they tried and why didn't that work?  Different things.

1:12:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for one of them was repertoire. They didn't have the technical skills to do it. They were like charismatic people, but they didn't know the tools of workshops and stuff like that.  And for the psychedelics guy, he is a brilliant guy. just lacks focus to follow through on his stuff. having an outsider that really got him, because we understood each other at a very deep level, was very helpful.  But I think what I did with him was much more like coaching than it was like, let's put together an experience, you know?  Virtually.

1:12:54 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Virtually. OK, cool.

1:12:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have thoughts on this one. And when you say the common thread, and when you say trying to even stopping them, so you're talking about obstacles, the idea that came to me was not wordsmithing, but the idea that came to me was like their nemesis, like a thing that is actively holding holding them back.  And because I also feel that when you create space for diagnosis, you also create space for archetypes. And that's like a plugin for the thing.  So if your clients keep facing the same obstacles, your clients will develop strategies to deal with those obstacles. hopefully.  And by naming them, you get what I'm saying better than what I'm being able to.

1:14:09 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually really good. Oh, that's actually a really good point. That's one of those things where it's like, it's super beneficial for them.  What the way that I always approach it is, so what I what I used to do was like, say, okay, cool, well, like, you know, what, what, what are your clients trying to achieve?  Like, what are they trying to get done? What are they trying to achieve? Like, what do you help them with?  Like, oh, well, they're trying to, you know, grow their business and we help them grow. Like, okay.

1:14:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, we help them grow with ads.

1:14:53 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Okay. The I can't unlock for me was was rather than me just saying Please be more specific like what do they get right now like what's like the quickest win?  Was to say like you know what everybody buys everything on two separate time horizons You've got like a like a long-term vision.  We've got a short-term goal as well So let's capture what they can expect to achieve and what what they're hoping to win across these two time horizons and What this allows for is like people.  Oh, sorry I'm sorry to cut you off. No I Apologies, I'm sorry.

1:15:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go ahead.

1:15:38 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  No worries at all What this what this really kind of shatters is is It's a quickest way to help people get out of their own way and think about their client and what it is I actually what what it is.  I actually want and so I think for So those two examples that you gave me What they're trying to achieve in the short term is that unification in the room is quickly but very, like, impossible.  And what's stopping them is that they don't have a process to do it, but they know that they need one, otherwise it wouldn't be reaching out to you.  My question for you is how did they know to reach out to you? How did they know that that was the solution that they needed?

1:16:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and in both cases, for me, it was very random, know, which is, I think, I hope your clients are at the more developed development stage than I am, but...  Yeah, they didn't have the language to, like, the psychedelics guy saw a post of mine about frameworks and I was like, oh yeah, I love frameworks.  It was just curious, right? And NGO, they didn't even know me. They hired my wife. Compliance stuff for them and my wife does like workshops because she lives with me And you're like we love the way you work.  We want more more of this, but not for compliance and she was like, okay I'm going to introduce you to a guy so um So yeah, the the awareness of the problem, you know problem aware solution aware that can think um It's it's I haven't cracked it yet Yeah But but shifting back to this To this thing and I don't know we're talking about this thing through my situation, but shifting back to this what What this made me think was It we're still talking about pain points Because we're using a new language and at the same at at the same time an ancient language, right?  it's ancient and people get it, but it's new, and they don't just assume that they get it. They're prompted to really think about it, right?  If you say pain points, people are like, yeah, yeah, pain points, yeah, I get it. Like, jobs to be done thing is really deep, for instance, and it's much deeper than most of us understand and realize.

1:18:18 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  But we think we know it.

1:18:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when you frame it in these recognizable archetypal ways, I think it's like the hero's journey kind of resonance.  Totally.

1:18:32 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And really, this question is what jobs to be done boils down to, right? However, they're trying to achieve more.  I do think, I about this the other day, I'm like, I think jobs to be done may be one of the most over-engineered marketing concepts of all time.  And that's saying something. It goes very deep, but I think unnecessarily so, in a lot of instances. But I do like, I do like,  word around nemesis, I think that really works. this helps them, it's like in therapy, right? You like, you give it a name, you give it a label, and suddenly it becomes something that you can real in like, do battle with appropriately.  So yeah, I think that's interesting. I want to keep talking about your business. But this is what I still need to, this is the least formalized process really, because everything I do often create an offer or retool what they sell to make it more viable and sellable and talk aboutable.  But it's very, it's been very instinctual and very intuitive. I haven't really got a formalized process around it. But leave that with me.  That's not a you problem. That's a me problem.

1:19:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like, okay, so to comment on that one. First one, I think the, you know, the mid-seating mutually exclusive, I think this hits it really well.  So there's no fat, I like it. As you develop this thing, I think it would be interesting if we could step away from another Venn diagram because the silhouette of the framework really affects how people remember it.  And if you have the same kind of silhouette, just reversing it like two at the top, one at the bottom, we'll make it.  Oh yeah.

1:20:35 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I'm really glad that you said that because I've got two, I can't have two Venn diagrams. Even though I changed the color, I knew that wasn't enough.  And even slipping it is good. Yeah. I wish there was like another type of diagram that achieved what, the beautiful.  tri-vendigrant is just so perfect, but yeah, okay, cool. Flipping it is a very good solution that I feel dumb for not having thought of myself.  Thank you for that.

1:21:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You make me feel dumb all the time, so this is only fair.

1:21:17 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  All right, at least you can grow both ways. I do think that, yeah, the framework with a name is incredibly powerful, as you know.  I think it's interesting that the psychedelic guy was like frameworks, I love frameworks. I don't, you're swiping back to you.  I feel like people probably don't know the value of a framework, but I do think that it wouldn't take that much for them to understand the value of a framework.

1:22:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think people don't see how immersed in frameworks we are. So I'm building my website, right, and I'm dumb about it because I want to do it myself on Cursor AI and .  Anyway, but the point was like every non-fiction author has a framework, every big one.

1:22:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And we don't even think about it.

1:22:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We were like, oh, yeah, sure. So I think there's an aspect of frameworks that is, people, it's very easy to get people to the nodding stage, yes.  But it takes a little longer for them to be, oh, to the face palm, to the, I don't know, what do you call this?  Yeah, the, yeah, the thing.

1:22:41 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I know what you're talking about. smacking.

1:22:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The head smacking. So it's easy to get into the nodding stage, but it takes a long time to get to the head smacking stage.  They think they get it, but they don't get it. So what does it take?

1:22:55 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What would it take for them to get to the head smacking stage? To me, I

1:23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think it's when they realize that they've been eating it up without even realizing it. That's my current theory. I have a list of content that I will put out about famous visualizations that people think about like the food pyramid.  This was invented. Somebody had a job to make you eat more grain and they thought about the food pyramid.  I think a lot of insight is about that. It allows you to tune in to a frequency that is all around you but you never notice.  I think frameworks are a little bit like that.

1:23:39 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That's 100%. The fish doesn't know it's in water. It's that thing.

1:23:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love that phrase. Okay, can I share this with you very quickly as well?

1:23:55 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  There's this book that John Green just published. and it is called everything is like this is and I listened to the first chapter and I'm like whoa everything is tuberculosis and I feel like everything is frameworks yeah I mean everything that can be expressed is frameworks and that's everything yeah well maybe not everything there is some yeah there's like feel your love and speak to that more intelligently than I but yes there is like a there is like a layer of there is like got emotions you've got thoughts that's a third thing that's a third thing going on but yeah yeah this

1:25:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, go ahead, go ahead. I was nerding up. Go ahead, go ahead.

1:25:03 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  No, no, I mean, I always, I appreciate your nerds up. that's, yeah, everything is frameworks. I just feel like there's really something there.  I really, it feels like a very big flag that you can plant. It ties directly to your work. It also is helpful to people.  It gets people to see the world in a new way and it's directly beneficial to their business. There's a strong commercial impact that you can make there because a framework isn't just a delivery tool.  It's a sales tool as well. And it's just a very underrated tool in the business world, except the people who know about it and they're all over it.  Yeah, I don't know what the opposing force is, but there would be something there. I feel like it feels like there's something there.  I may be going crazy.

1:26:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm about to start looking outside the frame, which means that I'm just thinking deeply. Yeah, it's referring to here, you say that with this emphasis.  On this step, I think this is a kind of a conceptual, this is a nice perk slide, because it's very easy to say, yeah, sure, but also I have no idea on how to do that.  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

1:26:41 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I don't know. But no, but yes, you do.

1:26:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know how to create a no, no, no, what I mean is like as an audience, like, yeah, sure, sure, yeah, I get it.  But like, how do I do this? I have no idea. But I can just put a big picture of my face.  Well, I this is what I need to

1:27:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Formalize I've built frameworks. I don't have again. It's down to like do I have a codified step-by-step framework for developing frameworks?  I do not that's something I have to figure out as part of the product development to go beyond intuition into coding and then this is really just like You want to you want to the clients they really only can see like three feet in front of them at any one time And so if you can come into somebody to be like look at the horizon over there, that's where we're headed People appreciate that they and they trust you more like oh my god somebody is going to take me by the hand and guide me and So that's really so what's the horizon here on this case?  the horizon is every touch point every critical touch point in your panel is Speaking to the same perspective it is cohesive and you have thought one  page that is reinforced at every interaction that their potential clients are going through so that by the time they get to the end and they go through all of these touchpoints they've if not embodied at least understood what the perspective is and appreciated so that when you do get on the sales call they're already kind of 90% of the way to yes and the sales call is just like rounding out the 10% to be like are we at the right fit for so love cocktail glasses I think that's that's a cool framework but what this made me think was the picture I had in my mind was maybe rugby like a lot of guys moving towards the line but one of them has like a role right I don't know rugby but thought leadership I understand that this thing  they there's a way of looking at them as a funnel but there's also a way of looking at them like these different motions then you gotta do all of them and they all another picture that came to me the australian thing is really getting to me because it was like mad max like all the cars driving towards the horizon but what i think it is parallels not um not not not a funnel and like fingers tripping into like they're all going to the same place yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh actually yeah i see what you mean i see what you mean it's almost like there's a or even kind of like going out from there's kind of like the nucleus at the center which is your perspective and then there's expressions of that perspective and the assets built against it and so that's kind of that the central  point, as beams of this rays of light always kind of come up. I think I found a better image for that.

1:30:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you the picture now. It's here.

1:30:26 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, 100%. Oh, my God, there's actually a lot to digest with this image.

1:30:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been thinking about making, like, uh, meat buses kind of videos with, like, real things, and I need to buy a lot of magnets and compasses because, yeah.  There's a lot to digest.

1:30:58 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  There's a lot, there's actually a lot going on. um with what's negatively charged and positively charged and whether oh yeah I didn't think about that because like the compasses are pointing towards it except when they're not and the orientation of the compass as well is different every time and they're all reacting to responding to this is very powerful like magnet right in the middle ooh okay and I'll book my compass I really like how how your brain works I really want my brain to work in a more visual way I'm just talking like word, land that visuals that work really well through um yeah yeah nice okay cool cool is that with me uh and then yeah

1:32:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I like the name Authority Engine, it's very good. I think it's good, but just because we are in this mode of trying to fuel everything, is there anything that you could use that doesn't need fuel and that conveys like it's a force of nature?

1:32:51 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It doesn't need fuel, it's a force of nature. Okay, sorry, the LinkedIn process. did the other day, I thought was interesting, if I do something like that, which kind of spoke to about, it kind of spoke about how like, you know, there's a lot of businesses that just kind of play the numbers game, right?  the ads don't work, they have the budget, if they call the emails don't work, they send more, if the algorithms are rewarding one particular style, they spam it, and like they're trying to make hay while the sun shines, but then they're back to square one as soon as the sun sets, whereas people who craft a particular perspective and stick to it, they see compounding effects of that, they don't make hay, they grow trees, and they do that by just seeding in the same concepts and ideas time and time again at every single touch point.  And over time, that grows and sprouts into a mighty, unavoidable, inevitable arch. Inevitable is such a great word.

1:34:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the metaphor you've used was, I never know if it's a metaphor or an analogy, but I should know about it anyway.  So it was around growth and growth as in nature. You know, they have a name for giftedness, they call it the Rainforest Mind.

1:34:54 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Really? Is that a thing?

1:34:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's like, maybe not a brand name, I think it came up.

1:36:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  in order to do it. have to water the plant. have to nurture. You've got to think about it. It doesn't just orbit ork by itself.  But I really like this kind of imagery versus engine fuel, mechanical, whatever. Way more true. That's a really good chart.  Yeah, yeah. It's more like an authority. It's more like an authority gap than it is an engine.

1:36:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I get a three for three on an Australian references?

1:36:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Please. a reef.

1:36:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like a reef.

1:36:42 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Like a reef.

1:36:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One that we haven't bleached. Yeah, yeah.

1:36:50 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, exactly.

1:36:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, I came to this briefing for that and you'll think later and the funny They had the mechanistic analogy, and I went on the chat, JP Tin said, I don't like his mechanistic.  What do you suggest? And he suggested the riff, so it's funny how he's using it. I like that.

1:37:13 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That was good. mean, anything to do with nature, it's always more to use your word from before ancient. Like, it taps into a deep part of your DNA than something man-made.  We appreciate it, and we understand it on a deeper level. Yeah, yeah. So I think, yeah. I mean, I really like don't make any plant trees.

1:37:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That just really works for me.

1:37:50 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And it is what I want people to do. I want people to be patient. I'm incredibly patient, to a fault, honestly.  Like, I have no. rush to like everything takes time. I'm happy to dig one well for 10 years and not have any payoff or gratification or anything.  That's a big support power. There's oil down there and eventually I'll get there. I'm so patient to that. And so this is kind of my philosophy as well as my, both a commercial and personal level is don't make hay plant trees.  That feels real. Yeah. Last one.

1:38:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Terraforming. I don't know if you've played that in the Netflix game. The other Neil is like a terraforming game.  They give you  up planets and then you need to put algae and rivers and eventually it becomes nice. Nice.  But the point is, there's like different ways of thinking about there before. It's like the Elon Musk like let's just bomb the atmosphere and eventually we'll get like the whatever that's this and then there's the other like more space tree hugger version which is like oh solar punk and you know so they have really different connotations but the idea of putting a rock into a home.  But anyway sorry I think yeah I got excited. No that's cool.

1:39:33 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  definitely like yeah my first instance is like we'll nuke the planet and then put drones on it but yeah yeah yeah yeah no this is this is way better and now I kind of want to go back through and seed that seeding language that major language for everything and maybe that's  the title because obviously the perspective process is a good placeholder but not anything to feel emotional about and I feel like there's something there around the perspective planting process or something um has to be a literature of course that's how you know it's good uh yeah okay okay okay hey thank you so much for oh my god that's so over time this has been super super super helpful like terrifying for me and so great to talk shot um yeah I love to do it you know I love the work so thank you for giving me opportunities to do the work yeah I'm happy to take advantage of you just okay yeah dude yeah dude and I want to repeat it because I'm also a sucker like yourself um and if you put like an interesting button in front of me  can't help but want to just chew on it. But, I mean, everything in the framework is awesome. Everything is awesome.

1:41:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just take the LEGO song. Everything is awesome. I'm thinking that as well.

1:41:15 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, everything is awesome. I feel like that's like, they're all, and like, there is a real, such a good, strong case to be made with establishing frameworks.  It's about where people identify the, where people identify the solution to the ads. Because maybe it is more like people have self-identified that we should be running workshops rather than working behind the scenes.  And so they're not thinking in terms of frameworks, they're thinking in terms of workshops and frameworks are a part of that.  And so maybe, maybe it is workshop. that that is what to be leading with, but I'm just going up here like assumption and gut.  What if we roll in terms of the frameworks?

1:42:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In terms of what people want from here? This is embarrassing, but I think mostly they're intrigued. They're like, oh, okay, let's see what we can do together.  And this is why we don't arrive at the same things all the time. And I was reading because what they're intrigued by, I think for them to be intrigued is that they are so  much in my ICP on the level that's not even legible as we did, we just buy right, which I think is a problem.  I should be able to work with people that are not copies of me, but but I get this a lot.  People say like I like the way you think and I want to, I want your help to think about this thing and I've been trying to formalize it and like, oh, this is the dual way of thinking and it's a moving target because I actively try to read about how to do these things and I keep changing my perspective.  So I'm thinking more for instance, I shouldn't perhaps have a book, I should have a deck of cards because deck of cards you can shuffle it and edit it live.  I'm more a deck of cards guy than a book guy I think in terms of the model. So yeah, but that's not you and the

1:44:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  the delivery of the work? I want to know what they're trying to buy from you. Yeah, me too.

1:44:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's really annoying to say this, but me too, because, okay, so instead of being around Bush, I don't have that many clients, right?  And a lot of the clients that I get are like referrals for, like, ah, we should talk to this guy, maybe he'll help you.  They're like borderline coaching, creative coaching, kind of things. And so what they're buying is really a certain kind of creative perspective that is very open, but I don't know.  It's just, this feels a very unsatisfactory answer. Ideally, what I would like people to buy from me is helping them convert what they're thinking to workshop or frameworks.  But you see me say this of time. I'm not at the stage where I can get people reliable to come to me and say, hey, help me do that.  I think it's, I think I'm a little bit of a ghost writer for visuals, kind of like that. But I really struggle with, I really struggle with drawing boundaries around that because those are like two different languages I think I speak, which is like the workshop thing and the visual thing.  And they really are like Portuguese and Spanish. They're not that dissimilar.

1:45:34 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  No, they're completely interconnected. Yes. Yes.

1:45:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, but at the same time, from an outsider perspective, they're separate enough that I think it can be confusing.  And I'm always like, it's my headline. it frameworks? Is it the workshops? I don't know.

1:45:52 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  The fact that I knew that you were, I have you in my brain. You're like the workshop guy. You help me.  and you help people turn their work into workshops. That's the headline. And so when I see you post something that's a visual thing, I'm like, that makes perfect sense.  That's just completely brand because part of a good workshop is visualizing the concepts that you need people to understand.  So it makes perfect sense to me. And I think turn your work into workshops is not a bad line.  And I think people have already, I talked to people. I referred someone to you.

1:46:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I want to talk to you.

1:46:37 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  They want to do that. Like, what is the appetite for that? I think you'd be surprised that if you just went out with that kind of very clean message of turn your work into workshops, there'd be a very good response.  I really believe that. I really believe that because and here is why and here is why. At a macroeconomic level.  Here is why what you do is very important. Because AI and general competition increase has commodified all of that lower tier work, agencies are scrambling to try and get up the ladder to be strategic partners, not just grunt work vendors.  And the way that you become a strategic partner is that you don't for your clients. And before then, you work with them.  They don't have the skills to do it, but they know that they need to, and they are feeling the pressure, they are feeling the urgency of that all the time, and it's only getting more and more each day.  So I think you're in a prime position.

1:47:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree. I agree. that's entirely my thesis. AI will take away the floor out of the bottom ones. also this relates to why  try to become premium and why to convey luxury and why to we're moving into the symbolic right I think we're entering an age of secrets where like it's so easy to copy things that it's worth keep secrets um there's guys talking about magic have you heard about the telepathy tapes okay I think we're about to enter like really weird territory like all the people that study consciousness they're like maybe telepathy is real you know like real  the scientists are like yeah I mean and I think we are entering like this really strange but at same time ancient idea of maybe because we had chips and silicon like we got distracted but then like other things and I'm not rude at all I'm like I don't follow the our scope or anything like that in Brazil is really strong but the point is I agree with you that like  this symbolic thing and we need like tools to do that to create collaboration to make people get it and so I get it for some reason and I think there's probably a huge kink in my system that I see the thesis and I'm not doing something that I should be doing I think because I don't think I'm wrong but I think I should have more work but yeah I agree I think you speak more on the state of the industry and where things are going and essentially spot problems before anybody else does that is the skill of the new century spotting problems before anybody else does and yet talking at that higher level and being more strategic demonstrates that you can do for them what they need to do for their clients yeah that's that's  Very good. Yeah, that's good stuff. I can, I can, I know what to do with this. Right.

1:50:07 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Cool.

1:50:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. glad.

1:50:09 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I'm glad because you're  onto something, dude. Like, I'm such a believer. This is important and necessary needed and people will buy it once they know what it is.

1:50:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's get rich and meet up on the orbiting space station when everything goes to . I am working.

1:50:27 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Well, yeah. My plan is honestly a little bit to just have like a caravan that goes in the outback, but it will all be groomed by then.  But yeah, I, uh, yeah, I really, I really think that you're onto something and I want you to be successful, but stop giving away your work for free in sales calls.  Your ideas are what is valuable and they have to pay for that. They don't get that free. What they get is questions and thoughtful nods.  Thoughtful nods. I'll make a note here.

1:50:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thoughtful nods. Thoughtful nods. Yeah.

1:51:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, okay, Alex.

1:51:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, always amazing doctor. I love it. Um, that's not believe it so much timing between chats Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:51:12 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  You've been such a life saver. This has been so helpful. So helpful. I appreciate it so much Likewise likewise.  Thank you so much Sleep tight.

1:51:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes You
