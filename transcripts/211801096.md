0:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  And let's try to maybe keep it as a source of truth there and so that whatever is in Jira is working, you guys are working on next.  How usually, how am I doing it usually? Usually designer is included because I work usually in smaller teams. Rare, I worked on some bigger projects but last maybe year I worked in small teams and how I prefer doing it.  For smaller stuff is designer is included in the team like a developer. We have daily things where we go over the tasks for the designer and then we see what's designers, what that person did yesterday, what is the plan for today and if there are any changes.  And that way we try to keep in touch with all the dynamic changes that happen because it's pretty dynamic right now and I'm aware of that.  I understand that it's not easy. So that's why I'm trying to combine being fast when needed and being thorough when.  when death is needed. that's the challenge here. yeah, my suggestion would be for this stuff to be direct. So, okay, let's go directly and do this stuff, what we need to do, but for other stuff, let's follow a process that needs to be done.  Yeah. Right. And I think this is very important.

1:18 - João Landeiro
  And especially when we agreed that, you know, as Abby is doing some kind of research or review the platform, even though you are leaving something for, you know, the release in the launching, she may come with some other information or she may come with another suggestion for the crew or something like that.  So that's why we need to be very aware that this is possible now. Oh, this is not possible now.

1:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think, yeah, sorry, but I think I need to be included a bit more in in all of discussions, because I have a feeling that I might help there to  to unite the common goal or help Abby with focusing and help you guys with choosing the priority and maybe try to steer the ship back on track or train back on tracks when we maybe go too far for what's in front of us because currently our core priority for everyone in the team, so everyone needs to be finishing policies, communications and training so that it's ready for testing as soon as possible, end of month ideally but probably start of February sometime so that should be the goal for everyone designers, developers, product managers, everyone and then the secondary goal is whenever we are done with the first goal, the secondary goal needs to be future whatever is next in the pipeline, could it be forms or whatever you guys discussed is actually next thing for February, we can talk about this with Abby and I would say we need to somehow try to keep focus on that and I know it's not easy, I know it's not easy  because also Abby is constantly getting feedback from clients. Then things are changing. It's a very difficult thing to put in a paper and define, OK, this is what we do because in a couple of days it might change.  So yeah, we can try something like that. Right.

3:18 - João Landeiro
  Oh, that's perfect. Thank you very much for that. And what about the JIRA? How are you using that or are you not using that for?  Yeah, I can share quickly.

3:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  My screen just so that you see what we have. So basically, I'm not sure did you use JIRA any time before?  I have. Yeah. OK, I mean, basically we are trying to keep it as simple as possible. This is development board, but this is not relevant to you.  What I would prefer is if you have your own board design board. These are all tasks assigned to Azar because he was doing some design work before I will.  remove it from him. Basically what you can hear how to do in progress review and done and that's it as simple as that and the priorities can be defined here it can be the top of the list can be the biggest priority and we can also use these priorities marks here and we can keep it as simple as that for starts.  Question, question.

4:25 - João Landeiro
  I believe Rumele has also used the JIRA in the past and why do you think I'm not married to this idea right?  It's just a quick question. Why do you think we should separate development from design boards?

4:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Just so it's more clear not necessarily needed if you are if you know a better way or cleaner way let me know I'm up for discussion this is something I set up initially and we didn't have design you can see that these are all tasks couple of them and we stopped there so nothing  was done here, so I'm up for discussion if we need to do it, but usually development is separate from design, so I'd like to keep boards to have a nicer preview.  We can have a same board with different filters. I'm fine with that also, and we can see everything in one place.  Please, if you have some suggestions or a to improve it, I'm up for that. I like your idea of the filters.  Then we can maybe have some kind of filter here or something, and I don't know, because here I can sort from front and back and work, but I removed design from this.  was more clear to me, but as I said, I don't have strong opinion on this.

5:45 - João Landeiro
  All right, so I'll just ask you, because I haven't used dry ground, but anyway, is there any kind of integration from JIRA and Figma, for example?  And?

5:58 - Ivan Ćelić
  Figma. Yeah, there are there are bunch of integrations actually here you can attach a figma design I think we have to have integration or something but but it's it's you can so if I paste a link from a figma for example you can see it now here I'll just work for demo purposes then it says connect your figma account then I connected blah blah and then you get a preview in here and so on so just it can do a bunch of stuff but but I would start simple I don't I want to keep so you we have to do in progress in review we're done we can even talk about if you need to in review column we can add another column and so on so let's let's discuss as I said I'm all for it just the single thing that we need to have now is some source of truth what needs to be done and we need to have it similar so that's that's it basically list of things that need to be done and in some kind of perfect yeah just I'm talking about the integrations

7:00 - João Landeiro
  especially for the approval part of it, even if it's either for Ivana Provinat or Abit, so we keep it the same page or if it's a prototype or a specific page or something.

7:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can you please repeat the question?

7:15 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, overall I just want to say somehow it doesn't have to be complicated, but you know, to keep a link on Figma for approval especially, because you see if you have some comments on Tiara and comments on Figma, I really wanted to have everything in the same place because what's happening in a way, let's think about it.  even with making simple in our back of our minds. we want to try to advance and collect all the information in one place because I we have some requests from Abit on email and we have some requests on email.  and we have some requests on our conversations or our daily meetings, that's in my mind how I really wanted to put everything in place, JIRA might be the best.  I would say like this, a request on Slack is not a request until it becomes a task in JIRA.

8:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can ask for something in Slack and that's how we usually do it in development. Epic asks or mentions we have a bug, blah blah, and then someone from the development team usually me opens a task in JIRA and writes the description so whoever takes that task notes what to do, and that's how we operate.  And I would use the same approach here regarding the request from various sources, so if Epic calls you on the phone or sends you an email or something, it needs to be done.  Okay, let's put it in JIRA, and then we put it there, and then when it's there we have it in our pipeline and we know we have to do it, and then we prioritize.  There was, you mentioned... regarding the comments on JIRA versus comments on Figma, we can link Figma pages in JIRA so that we have the link there.  But I think it will be easier to comment things directly in Figma because it's just its visual. So when I don't know, I want to tell you, but it needs to be bigger or something, then I can show you which button in JIRA it will be hard to do.  But I don't think that will be a problem if we just link the design with the task. I don't see that as an issue.  Perfect.

9:28 - João Landeiro
  Because I think two types of requests, one is for development and another one is for design. So we also, from our side, we send tasks on JIRA for design specifically, which is not connected necessarily to development.  cool. OK.

9:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'll repeat that. Also, mean, I have part of my job is also to see if we have design or if design if you guys are working on something that we'll need in two weeks or a month.  I'm also trying to keep track of that, so that's why I think it's better that I might be even more involved with the meetings you have with Abby, although sometimes it is a planning for further ahead because that way I can keep an eye on what's the actual focus from the tech side, because I know what we will be doing from the dev side in the next couple of weeks or a month, and I think I need to make sure that we have designs ready for that in the next couple of weeks, if we can of course.  So I would say that I will help you manage when a development request come in, I think it's both on you guys and me to see if we need to do something on the design side, and then finally do the dev work.  That's cool.

10:49 - João Landeiro
  João, any comments? No, I think this is exactly the way to do it. This year is good.

11:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I think that's it and yeah, I mean the tools and the process I'm all up for changing it if we see that we can be better at something so feel free to suggest another flow or something and of course I would say let's see what works for us because none I would say not every project is the same and not every group of people working on project is the same and so on so I would like to adjust the process to fit our needs best so if you don't need too many meetings let's not have it if we need let's have that and so on depends on the program let's see how it works right now this month we need to move quickly and that's the goal we need to be quick in trying to define things trying to get started as soon as we can and not to get stuck into too many you know tinkering or thinking so yeah of course we do not if something needs to be done if something requires have days of work it requires five days of work that's fine but let's try to maybe start working on that as soon as  can to get it on time or something like that. I would say that's the crucial thing we need to do right now.  Perfect.

12:12 - João Landeiro
  I think there are two more things. we haven't seen yet just Romeo has done two of those tasks that we requested.  I don't know if you have a look right now or I can send to you or we send to Abby and then maybe Romeo can share with us and if you have some questions, you can translate as well.  So Romeo, do you to share a screen? So do you need my telephone? Yes.

12:42 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Vam, I think she's very so bad, but I'll try it, huh? No worries, no worries. Yeah, no problem.

12:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  No worries.

12:55 - João Landeiro
  We speak Portuguese, Viva.

13:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think it's a very cool language to speak, and it's very, I would say widely used, so it would be nice to think about it.  A lot of people, but they're all in the same place. That's fine, lots of things to do, let's see.

13:22 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Here, on the screen here, instead of buttons, we were missing the missing buttons. The missing buttons, yes. The same thing on the A7 says here, we removed the design that the platform didn't want, so I the text as if the user had put it without needing it.

13:54 - João Landeiro
  More slowly we can move on.

14:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Leão and Ivan commented that on this design screen we could not have design elements, so we removed everything, I left a text for the month, only from the edition.

14:10 - João Landeiro
  Yes, yes, but I just to translate to Ivan, speak in smaller I think Ivan understood this, but just to practice.  So we removed every design element here to keep it, like you said, just text.

14:24 - Romeu Rodrigues
  And this is the editing mode, which the editing mode brings here the part of the title editing, as it was before.  So we reformulated this page as we had requested to do the design, but we had forgotten these elements here of download, screen, editing.

14:45 - João Landeiro
  Ok, so we've changed that page, we had changed it before, but we had forgotten previously those elements at the top.  The buttons, can you zoom in on OK, A.

15:03 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Is that?

15:04 - João Landeiro
  And also included title edition box.

15:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  And how does this look on the screen? So when I click, when I'm on the policies list page, when I click on view policy, what happens?  Is this a separate page? Is this a model? Or how does this look on the screen? Because we are having issues on the widescreen because this is very narrow.  You can see that it's narrow. And when it's a widescreen or have a 27 inch screen, and it's lots of empty space, we just open it on the sidebar, so not through the screen.  Or do we, how does that work? I need help with that part. OK.

15:42 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It's on the sidebar here, as we had talked about. But it's not that question, it's that question.

15:49 - João Landeiro
  This one appears in a model or appears inside the structure that exists today? Inside the structure that exists. The two side are what we're looking for to centralize this part.  right.

16:08 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Because there's the Autodesk 4, it talks about the design of the screen, it's very stretched. And then I made here a proposal, right?  Here it's a 27-inch monitor where the elements don't get full, they get more centralized. So here on this screen I did the same thing, so I brought the most centered elements so they don't get 100%.

16:30 - João Landeiro
  Okay, but that menu over on the side says Overview, compliance map, this menu appears or all of this is in a module?

16:39 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Exactly, that's right. Today this feature here is in a module. I think we can keep instead of being on a separate page because it's not in a program I've already done.  So let's keep it in a module. Okay, so even the suggestion is to keep this in the module.

17:00 - João Landeiro
  The question, Ivan, was how does this work in a wide screen, correct? Is it a full screen model? Is it a part of the screen model?

17:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  How does that model look like on the screen? OK.

17:11 - João Landeiro
  I don't know if you can see it, but does the model occupy the screen or just a part of screen, as if it's a window or a software?  It doesn't matter.

17:19 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Can he draw it?

17:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  It doesn't have to be now, but can he draw it out just so that we have it when we will be working on it, so that we have it so that the developer can see how it looks like that model, exact model.

17:31 - João Landeiro
  So, what Ivan asked for, it doesn't have to be now, but it would be very useful to do that on Figma, show me how it inside.

17:40 - Romeu Rodrigues
  OK.

17:41 - João Landeiro
  OK.

17:43 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Then I'll take those comments that Ivan made, when he inserted us in the turn, take this story there too, that we were following in these analysis through the turn.  OK. OK.

17:57 - João Landeiro
  Here it was an of a screen that he asked for, square 4.

18:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  that commentator about the policies being very wide screen. And then tried to make a that we can do in many ways.  We can centralize, just block, have the maximum of work in the initial content. Or we can centralize everything too, centralize the bar together.  My suggestion is to keep the bar on the left, and just the content of the middle and centralize it, depending on content of the bar.

18:32 - João Landeiro
  Okay, so the suggestion on this design is to center the main block, but always keep the left menu sticky to the left side.

18:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, yeah, and fixed width, is it fixed width then for the central menu? For the central part, fixed width, always the same.  Rumeu, the central block always has the width.

18:58 - Romeu Rodrigues
  this is the resolution. for all the platforms, be it here or only in the policies or in the formulars, the idea would to keep the maximum there of 100 and 1,130 pixels, for example, lock, block and never expand too much, when you have a monitor with a super wide screen, it's always centralized.  That would be the idea.

19:30 - João Landeiro
  Perfect. So, regarding these two tasks, this is the number 4 and the way it looks on the wide screen.  the task, I think it was number 1, what you asked for was, can we see this form in the model itself, right?  This was your request. Yeah, I just need to see how it looks on the screen.

19:58 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, because model will show over the... screen that policies listen I need to see how it actually looked I understand but let if you can if you can draw it Romeo that would be great just so that developers also can see it will be easier just to see if it's a part of the screen is it full screen is the background the black is the background transparent and that type of stuff just so that we know I think the is necessarily the navigation of the buttons but it is a of appearance I'm seeing the complete I have to manage it with something that is here ok so yes agreed we will put this into the model so that it looks like the way yeah once programs perfect perfect yeah also one one thing just to add on the screen can you zoom in on the third or zoom in on the middle no no the left one yes that one you can put  So what we need, one thing that's in, you can check, I'm not sure if it's there, but what we need is we need info section in the right part.  So instead of review process, review process will not be done currently. We will probably do it, but sometime in the future.  So instead of review process, we will have some info like date, author, reviewer, approver, some kind of info. You can just put a couple of them.  I think I have them listed in the task description. So you can put a couple of them and version.  So you see V1 at the top, that's removed, and all of that is put on the right side, the right side bar.  I think a screenshot from Sprint or House Sprint has it. You can check. Wait, you zoom out, Rumeu?

21:46 - João Landeiro
  I got it, Joe.

21:47 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It's the one that took a picture of us in the platform. Then the question was, what would be the fields that we were going to there?  He said it now, but we don't have it in the description, what would be all of them?

22:00 - João Landeiro
  For now, the fields that we will put on the information bar or box is more about just placeholders or are there specific information you want to have there?  We already have specific information that we know.

22:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think I wrote it down in the description. you check or select message? me see. If not, I will write it, but they are not 100% correct, but they are not correct.  Sorry, they're not defined yet 100%, but they're like 80% they're not another field or two missing or added or so on.  But let me let me check. think I wrote it down. remember, I'm not sure. It's also on the Myerboard.

22:37 - João Landeiro
  I copied everything from, you know, this like number one with the picture.

22:52 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I'll just copy it. I have it in my JIRA development, so it's fine.

23:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  I will paste in slack or I can be wanted here in chat so you can copy then this I'll paste it here in chat so they I don't know but I would say the what else a version and there we probably some things will be added over  That's it. I think. Last edit. Last edit. Ok.

24:09 - João Landeiro
  you can copy and paste it on that little print that he sent, do you know what it is? I know.

24:18 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Just ask João to copy and see if he doesn't see it.

24:31 - João Landeiro
  Ok.

24:34 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Ok.

24:39 - João Landeiro
  Ok. Ok. Ok.

24:41 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Ok. This one.

24:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  Something like that. We don't have the exactly same columns, but for example, they have an author, they have a prover here, they have a version somewhere down below and so on.  So we won't have as much as they have here and we don't need the editing or stuff. section for now.  Over time this will probably grow into something more complex but for now for the initial version we need only a couple of info fields there.

25:20 - João Landeiro
  Even the approver is editable or is fixed?

25:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's fixed because approver is the person who clicks approve on the policy so there is button at the bottom you have deploy action and approve action so approver is whoever clicks approve and I would say that will be fixed that won't be editable after someone approves that's it for now.

25:48 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Is there profile pictures for the approvers or just initial letters?

25:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  For now we don't have them so don't put it you can put it in the design but I don't think we will have it for now because we don't have the

26:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  option of yeah and all that stuff but later yes later yeah okay so so sorry later okay I have a question, is history in the last edition?  Maybe there are versions, can we click on the version and access the version or is it just a story with the type of version?  I don't so, we can edit it. Your question is, can we access the previous versions or is it just to see how many there are?  Because there is a where can create some kind fun and then you can create a story with editable and that's when you rescue an old version from the version function.

26:46 - João Landeiro
  Okay so even when we have the version drop down does it mean that we can open a previous version or is it just no?

26:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  The plan is to have versions in the future but for now just show a version just just Not even a drop-down.  No, we won't implement it sometime in the future, probably, yes. But for now, we want it just so it's there, like it's not empty.  Currently, it doesn't have much sense, but let's just have it.

27:21 - João Landeiro
  All right, we have over time, so I don't know if it's going to continue. Continue here. We haven't had a little bit more time, so we're finished here.  I don't want to keep you. Yeah, I think, yeah.

27:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  Do you have anything? If you don't have anything else, I think that's it. I think this is good. I like the look.  I just want to see also the model of how it looks. But yeah, this looks good to me, so yeah.  Yeah, that's it. think about that at the top. There's a welcome to the policy review. Does this change because policy?  it can change statuses from not approved to reviewed, sorry, not approved, approved, deployed. Wait, wait, wait, can we write that on the chat?

28:11 - João Landeiro
  yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

28:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, I can copy it maybe, I'll just write. So, I have a diagram of statuses, but for now I'll just write it here.  So, the status can be is not approved, not started, sorry, yeah, not not started, then we have approved, I think then deployed and then completed.  Are the statuses of this page basically from the admin standpoint, right? So, my question is how does this top part change depending on the status because it doesn't make sense, the text doesn't make too much sense if it's, I don't already deployed or completed, right?  So.

29:00 - João Landeiro
  Okay, okay, so, okay, understood, understood. So, the question is the following. This policy that we are seeing, it can be in various states.  It can be not started, can already have been done and so on, right? Depending on the state or the status of the policy, this bar above makes sense, because people have already seen that.  If the policy is already in state deployed, then this bar loses a little sense. And the question that Ivan is doing is, are we going to have alternative visions of this bar in different states or not?  My suggestion is not for now, but I think that Ivan will learn this discussion.

29:45 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It's a good idea, the idea, but I don't know if it be easy to understand that, but for now I think it will be worth it.

29:57 - João Landeiro
  So, let me, so what Romeo said is... that changing it could be a good idea potentially, but with that to figure out how to make.  Let's just remove it for now for this version.

30:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  Let's just not have this at the top and then we can edit after this string to generate because it just, I don't know, if it adds work to you and us to think of the text images and all that stuff, I'm fine with just removing it for now.  I suggest the opposite.

30:24 - João Landeiro
  I suggest we keep it because a lot of feedback from Abby has been around people don't understand what they're looking at.  So this helps in that regard.

30:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then we just need to update the text and the image or not image, maybe just the text according to the status of the policy.  I paste it right now from the code. This is the list of all the possible statuses. So for each of them, we need to have a different text.

30:50 - João Landeiro
  A different text inside of the salmon bar, the orange bar.

30:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, because it says welcome to the policy review. So in theory, this is not only policy review because this is a page where they will follow the policy progress also because once you deploy the policy you see this uh this small tab uh two tabs policy overview correct yes overview yes so this the disabled one becomes enabled once you deploy so once the staff becomes deployed the it becomes enabled and then you can see a table of all the users and you can track their progress you can see who accepted the policy and who did not yet theory it's not only policy review page it's basically like a policy page so we can have a single text we don't have to have a text for each status we just need to have something that's you know uh that works in every situation exactly exactly i'm fine with both just we just need to define it this is probably something that we can also ask abid to help with so regarding the design design looks good to me just a question of if this will change with each status or will text be the same for all the statuses

32:00 - João Landeiro
  got it yeah I don't have any more questions let's just maybe not on this call but soon create the gira accesses yeah for that give me the emails or I can use the slack emails I'm fine with that I can give you access and and how you can ping me and I can help you set it up we can set up together and that's it especially if you use it all do you'll do you can put that pretty much quickly if I'm not mistaken from that we can what we discussed yesterday from the users page I think it's okay but we have more questions and more doubts about the user group page okay so we are gonna organize all the questions and yeah yeah yeah sure no problem just just ping me when

33:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  We have them and we can go through the list and see what we can do. that's right.

33:08 - João Landeiro
  Okay, if that's it, thank you.

33:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, and yeah, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Yeah, thank you.

33:15 - João Landeiro
  Have a nice day. See you tomorrow. Wee! To the Bay Asians.
