0:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I thought I've been speaking for a few minutes. Um, how are you? Doing great.

0:50 - Patrick Kizny
  Nice.

0:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then good. I think great is a strong word, but nothing, nothing to complain.

0:59 - Patrick Kizny
  No, it's good. Enjoying the late stage summer here and man, picking mushrooms and doing household work and this kind of stuff.  So cool.

1:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Grounding work, I suppose. You know, have you been picking up mushrooms for a while?

1:24 - Patrick Kizny
  Is this something you know a lot about? Well, yeah, I used to do a lot of that in childhood and you know on the hill where we leave, there is so many mushrooms.

1:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a spot, man. Nice, nice. I love mushrooms. I'm not brave enough to pick them up, but I love mushrooms.  I mean, in the food, I've never tried the crazy ones. I'll probably like them as well, but never did.  Anyway, what time is it there? Is what four o'clock in the afternoon?

2:00 - Patrick Kizny
  Five o'clock and I have about an hour for you.

2:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, cool. I have a little bit less. got to say, because it's going to be lunchtime in a second.

2:12 - Patrick Kizny
  But you get your priorities.

2:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's not just up to me. So thank you for the link. I think that's why I planned for this much time.  I think the link was like for 20 minutes and then I just in the calendar. So let me open up like our last chat.  Yeah, I asked you about, you know, like, I think kind of vibes or like how I come across. I think that that was kind of the question.  And you were telling me about Max trailer. I haven't read the book yet. I've been in bit of a frenzy this past week.  think it's a good motivation. And yeah, so I think that's the biggest question for me right now if you can help me with that, because you've been very open.

3:10 - Patrick Kizny
  Right. How do you across?

3:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, exactly.

3:15 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay. First of all, genuine, no , very sincere, very honest, very laid back, but still precise. Interesting, generous in terms of, you know, your expertise.  Definitely not salesy. What else? I could go on and on.

3:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's very nice to hear. I do think that I don't come across as confident.

3:49 - Patrick Kizny
  And I think that's an issue. I didn't, I didn't have any sort of vibes like that.

3:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I, I do not come across. across lacking confidence to you.

4:02 - Patrick Kizny
  No, not for me.

4:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

4:05 - Patrick Kizny
  Not at all.

4:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me give a little bit of context. Thank you for this very kind of What I've so for the past year, something that was really important to me and for me was to get on more calls like this, like just meeting interesting people online and having interesting conversations.  This made a huge difference on many levels. You know, help me connect with other people and feel a little bit less weird sometimes.  And also, it gave me a little bit of a confidence boost because you know, sometimes when you're not communicating with others who just in your world and if you're a critical person, you tend to assume that you are, you know, you are below everybody else.  then when you meet interesting people and It seems that you're having you know valuable conversations like oh I can keep up with them, which is nice So that was very nice for me And I'm not surprised that I don't come across as not salesy big That I I don't come across as salesy because I think I've been always kind of running away from being salesy But I'm starting to think that there's levels to this right there's like zero salesy and there's like Slide me salesy and there's probably an equilibrium somewhere and I I'm getting the feeling that I'm too much on the non-salesy at all and and then I struggle with converting like Me many people with possible clients Mm-hmm.  So Yeah, I'm kind of trying to calibrate that. I was up into someone I also met the other day very friendly guy very nice guy also becoming friends like we are and Gave me like these tips that it comes  that guy comes from sales. So he was helping me like transition, know, from the one kind of conversation to another kind of conversation.  So anyway, basically that's my context, because I do get the feeling that I do come across in the ways you've described, but I could probably sharpen this a little better to make it like 10% more effective.

6:33 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, it does. question is, because I remember on one of the calls that we had earlier, on the second call, you mentioned something very casually regarding setting boundaries.  Which kind of came across to me. as if our first conversation was something that you should be charging or should be charging me for something like that, right?  Because you didn't bring it for no reason. And if there's a piece of advice, I could, like, two pieces of advice that I could bring.  One, and this is something I'm learning very recently that friends, partners, and acquaintances of this kind are... I don't want it to sound transactional, but are much more valuable than a client.  So that's one thing. That's a broad big picture. And the second one is, well, being clear about what the call is about, right?  If this call is and it's not about... about selling someone something or discovering call or like prospecting call where you assess whether it's a fit or not, then it's fine.  It's just a casual call. It's prospecting call, then it's clear, okay, ask leading questions, we make sure that we understand that we're clear about the intent of working together, right?  Yeah, yeah, Something like that. But at the same time, this is something that I'm still grappling with a little bit because this changes a lot.  And so, especially with conversations like I had with yourself or what I learned from Max trailer, I'm seeing that  the boundary between a sales or prospecting call and a casual call blurs. It's like, you know, the prospecting versus non-perspecting call is like very old school right now.  It's coming from the old sales world, whereas where the business is shifting in my opinion is much more towards genuine casual conversations which are interesting and maybe from there it takes somewhere else.  I think that's the new way.

9:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was pulling up my notes from our first conversation and yeah, I remember that, I remember.

9:53 - Patrick Kizny
  Did I said something like that?

9:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I remember that in the first, because in my notes I don't have like Like what we'd say, I was not writing like the speech.  I was writing like how I felt about it and things that came to me. One of the things that says here, and I remember this now, is that for some reason I got really nervous, physically nervous.  I think it detected this, it said that I was shifting into my shares or something like And I don't know why, I mean, for some reason.  I even wrote here, like I don't know why, I got really, know, kind of anxious. Couldn't say exactly what it was.  And then I also said at the end, like, oh, I spoke a lot, I might have given away too much, something like that.  But it's funny because I think these things happen in the context, right? At that moment, whatever was going on in my mind or something like that.  And I think the two things you said, like the friends being more valuable than a client and being clear about what the call is about, I think make a lot of sense.  Despite the changes in the environment, in the sales environment. So I think, yeah, I'm talking to you when I'm figuring this stuff out, I think it works for me.  I think one of the reasons that maybe I get like this fear that, oh, I'm just giving away everything, right, might be because I don't have a thing that people could buy.  I don't want to say whatever, of course, just to use an example, right? So if my only way of delivering value is through conversations, I have an incentive to be really mindful of, am I turning this free conversation into like, am I giving away something that I could be paying my bills with?  And now talking to you, it just seems to me that maybe if there's some check out page somewhere, and I can just have  as deep and as open a conversation and just know like if this turns into an opportunity, I'll just send a checkout page and they take it from there, right?  So that's a new thing to me.

12:15 - Patrick Kizny
  I don't think this this kind of thing will work.

12:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because of advisory work, you mean?

12:24 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, because if you're if you're getting with someone on a call and there is no clear intent and prospect of working together, then situation where you would gatekeep part of this conversation, like pay off of this conversation.

12:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That sounds weird to me.

12:46 - Patrick Kizny
  That's yeah. And also it's so I'm not saying this there is no way to make work because if you're smart, you can make anything work.  But generally that would be a contrary to how I think about good service design and what I know about good service design, and essentially what I mean is that in any service, there is payment and then there is a delivery of the service.  And to focus on the delivery of the service, you need to get the payment out the You need to get the payment out of the way, meaning that the money is already sorted out, that the sale is already down, because only that situation gives you full comfort for both sides to truly get into the service that is being rendered.

13:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me repeat this back to you to see if I can. If, during the conversation, advisory work, whatever, there's still like question marks around the transaction, the payment, that holds back from whoever is giving away whatever or sharing perspective, advice, And if you get into these conversations with that thing already started out, then everybody gets like the full experience, like, okay, this is started out.  So you get the full me and we explore things that, uh, you know, always checking out the map. we still inside the reservation?  Are we still inside the reservation?

14:46 - Patrick Kizny
  Is this the thing you're saying? Yeah, kind of. It's, it's, it's about having full focus on the service. Okay.  Meaning that both sides, it's need to feel fully comfortable. And that means there needs to be a purpose, boundaries and of course a payment because it's a commercial assignment, right?

15:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

15:13 - Patrick Kizny
  So it's like, I'm trying to think about situations where you have to pay halfway through something. Yeah, it like a video game DLCs.  The only situation that comes to my mind is highway. You go on a highway, I'm not sure if that's how it's designed in the world, in the part of the world where you're living.  You go on a highway and it's toll-free. And then you have the payment gateways at some point and you cannot opt out.  You can't change the direction you have to pay and you feel discomfort because of that, right?

15:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

15:57 - Patrick Kizny
  And, you know, it's one hundred... So earlier, there was a sign saying, okay, this is not a toll-free, this is a paid commercial highway, then it's fine, right?  But if it comes out of the blue, then it's weird, right?

16:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I agree, agree, definitely.

16:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Not the best analogy, I guess, pretty city-wise.

16:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it makes sense. I'm trying to make sense of some of the things going through my mind.  So to give you the context, I was trying to understand how I come across, it told me how I come across.  I do think that I have to learn a little bit more the skill of sales, not just vibes, know, at least know what I'm doing.  Because I don't know, I always try to stay away from it, then I get into the situations where maybe I feel that, you know, either I do  trick people into something or I'm I start to wonder like, am I converting this well? So that's my context right now.

17:12 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, look, the way I would approach it is as full, I'll make, I'll make some notes. know Fathom is taking notes, but if let's say you get on a call with me, like a couple of calls that we had and at some point we come at a situation where you think I could use your service.  Meaning we discuss, we have some rapport, we were in a good flow, we're open, meaning me as a prospect or the other side.  I'm open. If you, I'm sharing something about my business, my goals, my experiences, whatever, and at some point, you discover that I have a challenge or something that you could service, where you could help.  The way I would go about it is either in that very moment or towards the end of the call, I would say, look, Patrick, during this conversation, exchange a lot of perspectives, and there is one thing that I picked up where you have a problem or challenge, and this is something that I could help you with commercially, or under a commercial agreement, or in a commercial A commercial context or whatever, however you name it, would you be open to exploring how that could look like, or how that might look like?  something like that and then what happens is that first you don't sell on a conversation that is not supposed or where there is no expectation of, you know, bringing sales, heart sales.  Secondly, demonstrate that you are attentive and you listen to me and this comes from question, so you take it towards exploring a sale, but you do it drawing from the context.  And lastly, what happens is that you suggest a separate call to keep these things separate, right, right, because it would feel very weird where when we got on a call to casual  will we discuss something and you will transition smoothly to sale, even if there was a reason for that, right?

20:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. How did you learn this? How did you learn this?

20:15 - Patrick Kizny
  I didn't. I just thought about the situation and I thought about how I would solve it.

20:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because that guy I told you about that has become a friend that comes from sales. He told me something along these lines, like, separate the conversations.  And to me, that was like, oh, I never thought about that. But it's very easy to understand, it's very easy to follow, it just makes sense, right?  Separate the conversations. And so it's reinforcing, it's nice to see that you will do the same thing. And it comes across as something that fits, I think, how I am.  So I think one of the things about learning this, sales that as with everything is kind of a new thing, it's probably a bit uncomfortable with new things.  But then you can get into these like new thing, but that will never be not weird because you're not like the thing you're learning.  I don't know, learning sales from some crazy hypergressive North American dude, whatever. I'm like, no matter how much I do it, it will never fit exactly how I function.  And the thing you told me, it's more aligned with my personality, I think. Nice. Very good.

21:40 - Patrick Kizny
  So I think what would help you? Because here's what I'm seeing. First of all, the first call, you've gotten a little bit, well, maybe not nervous, but you had these physical reactions.  When I can't remember exactly the detail, but I remember we shifted subject do something about your business and either pricing or your offer or how you sell workshops or can't remember details, but that was a shift towards your business.  And I think I even mentioned that at that time. Secondly, I remember you mentioned something about struggling with pricing and from everything else that we discussed, like to me, I understand that you sell workshops, right?  But possibly, you're a smart guy and you mentioned business of expertise and selling your expertise or advising or consulting these kind of things.  And that means that you probably entertain an idea of charging for the kind of consultations like we had on the very beginning, right?  similar kinds of conversion. that you had. And what would help you is having absolute clarity on, okay, what do I sell?  How do I sell, right? Set boundaries for that. Define your offer. Think about what it is. And then once you put some effort into clarifying what it is and how much would it cost.  And like, you know, setting boundaries for that paid thing. Then you will have a pick-up moment because once you're in a conversation with someone and the conversation drifts towards something that you actually sell, it's easy to tell.  Like you can identify this situation and tell yourself, okay, this is the moment where we're transitioning towards something that I show

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to be charging.

24:01 - Patrick Kizny
  So then you take a clear stance on the conversation and signal that, okay, this is something I enjoyed talking about, but this is part of my service.  This is what I'm normally charging people for. And then you make a decision either you do a test drive with someone for, I don't know, 15 minutes or whatever, you tell them, okay, I'm normally charging for that.  Let's continue this conversation for the next 15 minutes or until the end of this call or whatever or until, you know, three more sentences.  But if you are interested in following that in the future, this is part of my paid service and I would be more than happy to carry on this conversation following, you know, a payment or not the best warning but that's so.

24:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Making arrangements or exactly. Yeah, you know what, yeah, you read me really well, I think I'm an open book to you.  And this is very interesting to see it set out loud, because I've been wondering that, or wondering if, so I think I'm transitioning, like, even internally, even in terms of self-image, I think I'm transitioning from, ah, I'm clever and I have ideas into, I have a business, right?  And in this transition, I think the, I don't know if you know that story, you must enter the forest where it is darkest or something like that.  It's like from Jordan Peterson, sort of stuff. So you kind of know the things you need to do, but you've been avoiding them, right?  And to me, being creative and all that, I think I I always avoid I tend to avoid the offer definition aspect, like this is what I do, which is why it's difficult and I get nervous when people ask me what do I do, how do I charge for it, you know, and because I need to have, you know, clarity on that and make some decisions on that as well.  And I can see how, you know, doing the thing you told me about. I would be, would anchor this a little bit more emotionally as well, otherwise I'm always trying to find the opportunity and I find the opportunity in the moment and I'm having a non-selling conversation, then if it feels weird, then I feel incompetent, like, I'm not able of converting this and maybe I shouldn't be able to convert that because that would be very weird.  So, yeah, this is good stuff. Thank you.

27:02 - Patrick Kizny
  Glad it's helpful. So one more thought that I had is that once you define this thing, you will have the situation where, okay, right now you are enjoying something which is highly valuable, meaning you're and therefore it's easy to get on calls with people, right?  But once you define this authoring, it will start slipping through the cracks, like slipping in, like sneaking in, that's not enough flow, I'm in the middle of the nature today, I'm language friction.  So the fact that you have and offering will start sneaking into the conversation and that may make some people may repel them right because it's very subtle but it gets in between the lines and gets through and you know people read that and because of that it may become a little bit more difficult for you to do first of all open conversations and secondly have the kinds of conversations that are truly valuable the way we define them and the way we discuss them right mm-hmm yeah yeah this makes a lot of sense and and then what happens is maybe what you want to do is have some clarity around what kind of conversation it is right  Is that a prospecting goal or is that a casual conversation and you need to make rules for your sale that on a casual conversation, you're never pitching and if there is a situation which may lead to a commercial engagement, you may hint it and maybe suggest another conversation to explore that thing in a commercial conference, right?  You can design it in many different ways but you need clarity around that and this clarity will help you being clean in how you approach things and also this clarity will beam and transform towards the other side towards person that you're getting on a call with, right?  They will read it. They will have clarity that, okay, I'm safe. This is a casual conversation. Okay, this is a prospecting call, right?  And for prospecting calls, of course, you need to be aware of the fact that most of them, I mean, many of them will not be a fit, and that's okay.

30:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, this again makes a lot of sense. And I'm wondering if, actually, I'm not wondering, I'm pretty sure that that was one of the things that has been keeping me away from defining clearly an offer, because then I get to have these conversations and not a lot of redirection.  But it's kind of a bait and switch, right? So I'm getting conversations based on the fact that people don't think I'm going to sell them stuff.  So I shouldn't be feeling bad when I don't feel competent at selling them stuff.

30:56 - Patrick Kizny
  Because it's not about selling, exactly.

31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And, you know, I also think that, I think earlier in this conversation, I've mentioned that, you know, starting to have conversations such as this one was really important to me.  And I also think that there's probably like phases to this. So for instance, like the first few conversations that I've just met, interesting people online, there was like no agenda whatsoever.  was like, hey, man, I look cool, I'm interested, let's chat. And it would kind of work sometimes depending on the people.  And so that was useful also in terms of like putting in the repetitions of feeling at ease, talking to people in a very open way, not task related, not job related.  And then all the doors start to open. Like it wouldn't make sense for me to start my journey into getting into calls with people.  It wouldn't make sense to start that journey with sales calls. I wouldn't be good at that. So, the feeling I'm having from this conversation right now is that maybe I've been staying a little bit too much in the kiddie pool of conversations like, oh, interesting people talking to.  And I'm like, oh, you've got this part. So just going to a little bit of a deeper end, get clarity, get more confident, be open, be transparent.  And you know, it's a different kind of conversation. It's like a maturity model kind of the next step. This is valuable as well.  Fascinating life.

32:34 - Patrick Kizny
  There's so much things.

32:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I mean, in terms of like, I don't know, an agenda, this has been very really helpful. I have a last question about this perception thing.  Because anyway, I have a last question, is there anything that you see me doing that you wonder like, I'm not sure if that's a good thing in terms of like how I come across something more obvious, I don't No, not at Okay.  Okay.

33:23 - Patrick Kizny
  I mean, besides the situation where I can read your body language, which tells me you're not comfortable with something, that's something which some people can read through, right?  on how good they are reading people and how consciously they interpret body language, accused like that.

33:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I remember the situation, I was like doing like this with a chair, right? Like skiing. Yeah.

33:59 - Patrick Kizny
  That's true.

34:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. thank you so much, Patrick. Yeah.

34:04 - Patrick Kizny
  The other thing that you're doing is covering your mouth, whether with two fingers or with a pencil, which is exactly the same sort of cue, right?  It suggests lack of confidence is comport and not being fully comfortable in the situation, meaning to communicate insecurity. Because that means your shy of your words to some extent or something like that, right?

34:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't personal quirks, but I agree with you. see that happening. Also, I shift my eyes even in the camera, which is

35:00 - Patrick Kizny
  easier the camera just look at the black dot right but in in in actual conversation I do this a lot but well I guess I'll have a lifetime to work on that but this thing there is one thing about the body language of this kind and it doesn't matter whether you refer to keeping camera eye contact or whether it's about body language in general but we don't interpret these things in absolute reference it's always related and we always interpret it in relation to the baseline of that person meaning we meet each other we get on the call or you get on the stage and for the first few moments you're establishing a baseline or how big your body language is  or for how, what is your default for eye contact, right? And then everything that follows, we interpret in relation to that baseline that you said on the beginning, right?  And that's why you probably shouldn't worry about whether you're looking in the camera all the time, because it doesn't really matter, right?  did you notice something weird about my eye contact and how do I look and where, like, what do you read out of that?

36:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I read much more from, like, the fact that you are in the chair, there's nature behind you during your cell phone, I mean, that tells me, yeah, because if I'm looking at

37:00 - Patrick Kizny
  because i'm never looking at the camera this is like not sure if it's this helpful for for you but when i'm on calls i'm typically looking at myself like right now i'm looking at myself oh i do that a lot yes right this would be looking at you um there is not much difference so it depends on the layout right i never look into the camera this looks weird and creepy maybe sometimes i do it potentially for a while to stress something to accent something yeah yeah i think i think i think that makes sense it's interesting this stuff with the body language i mean i never paid too much attention to it i think it's fascinating but just feels like a foreign language i i get it when you say like if you put your yeah i get it but it's not it's not something i'm too familiar with seems useful seems useful  So, what do you read from all these other cues that you mentioned, like me sitting and sitting in the middle of nature, there was one more thing that you mentioned on your cell phone?

38:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, casual openness, a certain sense of this is not rehearsed or like there's not the performance, like it's just chilling, I mean it wouldn't be weird, I don't know if you smoke, but it wouldn't be weird if you were like a cigarette, it's like that kind of vibe.  Yeah, I think that's how I read it pretty much, and go ahead, go ahead.

38:53 - Patrick Kizny
  Is it something that would stand in a way if that was a paid conversation or a coaching situation, like would your expectations be different if you paid for that service?

39:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To be honest, I think so. I think I'm a good old-fashioned in that sense. I do think so because I've had in the past, I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but that's how I and it was very, I think it had a very fascinating life.  was a bit of a bon vivant. And basically, the solution to everything was like,  what other people think. Colorful, a colorful guy.  it wasn't a little bit older, didn't get much about computers. know when older people get a profile picture on WhatsApp and it's like, they look like a thumb because they hold it like this, you know, the cell phone, they take a picture like this on WhatsApp.  And it was that vibe and I remember... This guy is just too carefree to pay attention to my therapy session, but yeah, I don't know.  In this case, the dynamic was a little bit different, right? Because I'm asking you more of a peer that is a few steps ahead of me, but not like this figure that will help me figure out my entire life.  So I think there's more space there. I do wonder if like my background, like things leaning against the walls of bed, it's off-putting, but that's temporary.

40:42 - Patrick Kizny
  So I'll do it with you, platter. Well, it's no answer to that, meaning, you know, the system matter. It's how you feel about it.  and it's about what are, because you can have a total mess behind yourself and don't give a  and like really nail the attention control and engagement in the conversation so that the stuff behind you doesn't matter at all because everything is between you and me or the other option is that you invite me to your space and you want to convey meaning through that space and certain emotions and stuff like that right and then you probably would want to be a little bit more mindful about the environment around yourself so it's it's about being conscious about what you want to project and how you want to communicate right.  Words is just you know a few percent and on top of that you have your cadence you have your voice you have your body language and of course extending that you have also the environment absolutely absolutely great by the way did you

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  because I know you've had your your your businesses for like two decades now something like that and was this stuff that you were like a natural at you were like you made a intentional effort to get better at what sort of stuff like this the the presence thing or the reading the cues or you know best eight minutes of this conversation right i think it's a mix mix of things first of all it's self awareness because i've spent thousands of hours on calls so even if i'm a very slow learner i learned something secondly it's because i'm open-minded and these things are interesting it's one of the tools that you cannot really underestimate it's just an important

43:01 - Patrick Kizny
  And thirdly, I think it's because of two reasons. First of all, I'm aware of my body being grounded, connected, probably have much higher awareness than typical people.  And it's not only about what I say in my body language. It's about everything around, and the reason for that is that I danced for a decade, many hours a day.  I didn't do it professionally, I did it like semi-professionally, but dance has been a huge part of my life, I would dance for five hours a day, seven days a week.  And during training, you work a lot with the mirror, and you keep looking at yourself, you keep studying yourself.  you keep studying how you come across, you learn your body, you learn how people react to that, and you learn about designing the frame, right?

44:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's really interesting. I'm not good with physical stuff, and I'm not very coordinated. So, yeah, dancing is difficult for me, and I mean, yeah, I'm bad at dancing.  But that's really interesting. That's very different from, I think that's an experience that not a lot of people have, that the amount of dance experience that you just described.  Interesting, very interesting. Go ahead. Yeah, the last thing to that is let's say the visual component, right?

45:01 - Patrick Kizny
  So, first of all, I've spent my career designing visuals. And that means, you know, as a photographer, cinematographer, designer, numerous ways.  So that means, whenever you're looking at myself in a camera, this frame is not accidental. It's always framed. I'm doing it naturally.  It's my second nature. Like, it's not premeditated, but I'm always so aware of that. That it's controlled. It's under control.  And the next thing is space around myself, because you noticed it. It told you something. And this is not accidental.  It's not maybe crazy, meticulously designed, but I'm aware of how I shape the space around me and how I invite people to this space when I'm on calls.  So, it's like this, it's completely some purpose, right? could sit like this, for example, right? Or I don't know, like this.  If I wanted to make an impression or, you know, cue this conversation towards, I don't know, my beautiful house or whatever, I would find it this way, right?  It's choice.

46:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. It's really fascinating because, you know, for me, this whole being aware of my body is kind of a recent thing compared to like the entirety of my life.  I use, I still do it, but now I see that I do it, like live too much in my own head and the body holds.  I'm learning this with the body holds and answers that they are not in the head, right? So, it's, because if you come across as very confident, but not confident in a way that, to me at least.  but not confident in a way that is not pushy just like, mean to me you look like you know you are you are okay with that and I think it just connects with everything you just said like you are used to seeing yourself you feel comfortable in that and that's how you come across not like confidence like sports, jog or anything like that so yeah it's just really fascinating oh all these things interact right because it also interacts obviously if like in my the conversation will complete a bit of a cycle now when it goes back to the idea of you know me delivering services this makes a whole lot of difference right there's whole you know there's many tools for the framing you know  And I know these intellectually, but I haven't lived this as much as I would like to like, oh, you set a certain price.  People have certain expectations. You ask certain questions. You build a certain baseline, know, you behave in a certain way.  So it's very symbolic. I think it's a very symbolic line of business interacting with others and figuring things out together.  So it's a really useful toolbox.

48:30 - Patrick Kizny
  Go and read about this book from Max. This is something I didn't mention for no reason. This is something I swallowed recently.  He wrote two books of a similar kind. One is Survival Guy for consultants and the other one is for agencies.  It's the same book. It has a little bit different flavor to it. So the one for consultants, I think it's better.  And there is a range of things that He mentions in this book that could be very helpful to you where you are right now in figuring out how to sell your services or you know some paths forward and this book is very short and succinct like you can read it in a couple of hours and it's probably better better than so many books which are like 700 pages or something like that.  Really one of the best things I've read recently on the subject.

49:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, but it's on his linking. Yeah, I have it here open right now.

49:50 - Patrick Kizny
  So interesting because I wanted to introduce you to Max. I made friends with Max recently. Um, I stumbled onto him.  Linkedin and then I read his books and then gave him a shout out and posted some quotes and then we got on a call And following that call I wanted to make a recommendation that he gets to know you because your Workshop designer and in his methods.

50:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There is a lot of space for workshops So I thought I'll put it in touch, but it turned out you were actually in touch Yeah, and that was it was a similar thing that was a guy David Chicago North American that I was a similar thing he was talking to Max and then he told Max that we should talk and then Max sent me message We have like one conversation hmm, and then I watch this I watch these Some recordings The offer I made to Max was like if you have a recording of something Send me and I'll audit.  Let's say that you don't workshop stuff. And I did that. And yeah, the call, it was friendly and everything.  And I think, I don't know, I don't know if I dropped the ball on that one, because I didn't keep falling through.  Or maybe I just didn't have a very clear offer and the thing got a little bit vague, you know, excuse me, my sort of the other guy would use it.

51:20 - Patrick Kizny
  Max. Okay.

51:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So name to face and everything. So yeah, I'm, I know Max, I think Max is kind of, I think is the real deal in the, in the sense of the type of consultant, I kind of like to sort of life.  Yes, organized the thing around his life, right? He talks about this often, that makes a lot of sense to me.  And yeah, maybe I should get get, get back in touch with him. So you never sent him this stuff for you review?  I sent him, I sent him, I sent him the stuff. But I think it just wasn't very clear what to do afterwards.  So I broke my own rule of workshops, which is like the workshop needs to fit into like a journey.  And you know how the workshop connects with the next thing, right? And because I didn't have a clear offer, I didn't know exactly what the next thing would be.  And when was that? Oh, that was maybe three months ago. Yeah, maybe something like that. I think I'll just, yeah, I'm thinking of just putting together some specific offer.  And I don't know, I need to think about this. don't want to think about this on my feet, but it's useful to...  It's a good guy to be in touch with, for sure. I think I share a lot of the same perspectives.  I feel a little bit bad that I might have dropped the ball in that one, so I'm shy about that.  But anyway, it's just no point in dwelling on that.

53:11 - Patrick Kizny
  I think what what what what next for now, or you are thinking, I'm thinking what's next, okay, because you ask me on a chat about how you come across, and there was some insight in it for you.  what I'm seeing is that you might benefit from some more introspection and building a strong foundation for what could be thought of as your personal brand, or, you know, it's a foundation, right?

53:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like that, I don't know.

53:51 - Patrick Kizny
  So that's one thing. The other thing that I'm seeing is, well, you have this offer thing to solve, right?

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and for some reason, you're not doing it.

54:09 - Patrick Kizny
  it's been months and you haven't addressed that. So what I'm thinking is that there is possibly something which is stopping you like personally from getting into that.  And well, I could clearly guess it. Maybe, maybe Jesus. I'm so slow today. Maybe precisely, maybe I'm wrong, but I think it could have to do a lot to do with a fear of rejection, simply.

54:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

54:50 - Patrick Kizny
  that's some work you have to do, which is ahead of you, because even if you have the best offer in the world, if you don't figure out these things,  Well, you won't sell it, right, even if it's the best in the world, so that's the next thing you need to figure out, and then, yeah, the offering and pricing, so a range of things.

55:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, just a couple of details, right? No, I agree with you. I think I was thinking more in terms of confidence, but I think fear of rejection might be further down in terms of like the pyramid of whatever.  I feel it's annoying to be something that probably takes a while to solve, but anyway, doesn't go away by being annoyed at it, but I think, yeah, I think you're very perceptive.  I think the fear of rejection is probably because like one of my favorite modes is that I start things, and then when they get, you know, up to a point that maybe I could show them or send them to someone.  I figure out some reason for, oh, this would never work. then I start the next day, you know? And I, it's not, it's not even procrastinating.  I could have might as well be playing video games. I'm not playing video games. I'm like building up stuff and not showing it to the world.  So yeah, I agree, of rejection is a big thing.

56:26 - Patrick Kizny
  But think about it, currently you have a good situation in your life, meaning you are not desperate to make money of it and you are enjoying a space that you have in your life where you can think about business and take risks and make steps without tremendous pressure of like having to make money on a daily basis, right?  You see what I mean?

56:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And imagine.

57:00 - Patrick Kizny
  What happens when it doesn't last forever and you're in a situation where your business is not fully there, but all of a sudden You need this thing that is not even complete to start making money right away Yeah, and this is something that converts into desperation And then it's so  hard to sell anything when you're desperate So the reason I mentioned that is that the moment to work on this stuff for you is probably I mean the best moment is right now because we have comfortable space for that You see what I'm in Absolutely.

57:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, totally and I think thanks I agree. I agree The best time to plan the tree was four years ago.

57:50 - Patrick Kizny
  The second best time is today, right?

57:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Something like that.

57:53 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, yeah I agree So men get a wrap because I have another tool coming for minutes. Enjoy this one.

58:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm glad you This is great for me. This is really good for me.

58:08 - Patrick Kizny
  Thank you. Thank you for that. I'll take a look. Maybe because what I'm planning, what I plan on doing is actually going life and public with many calls that I'm doing.  So there are two things. I may want to take some snippets out of this recording and put it in public if you don't mind featuring us both or otherwise if you don't wish for that, I could just use simply myself, right?

58:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think if you let me see what kind of stuff.

58:41 - Patrick Kizny
  I don't recall any gems on this one.

58:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was quite slow and sloppy today.

58:51 - Patrick Kizny
  Not my use of sharpness. But anyways, second thing I'm planning on doing is doing a public kind of like.  I haven't fully conceptualized this yet, but one thing would be having this kind of conversations that we're having, but a little bit more subject oriented and having them in public, which I would love to invite you for.  And the second thing that I'm planning on doing is doing some sort of coaching or advisory work in public, I mean, these are big words, right?  But helping in public so that people can see, you know, how I think, how I approach people and how I solve problems on the fly.  So I'm thinking that if some of the subjects that I mentioned to you today, that you have a head of view, if you'd like my help on that and you'd like this to go public, we could give it a shot and do one or two in this format.

1:00:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I lean towards yes. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that everything goes live.

1:00:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Think about why.

1:00:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'll think about it. But basically, the thing is, I think there's a way of making that work for me, because I like the conversations.  They're useful to me. like to be useful to you as well. It's just, for me, just about not going too much on the being vulnerable for strangers, not just for you.

1:00:42 - Patrick Kizny
  But yeah, we can find way around it. Gotcha. Gotta run.

1:00:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cheers. Enjoy your life. Cheers.
