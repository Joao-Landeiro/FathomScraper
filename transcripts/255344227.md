0:12 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, I have a quick chat with Abby a couple of hours ago, maybe an hour ago or something. And I explained a little bit about what we discussed last week in terms of a plan for the next deliveries, our proposal and the reason why.  So mainly we wanted to focus on something that we can predict in terms of team efforts, how many hours we can spend in a project for a specific launching date and also something that we can carry and go on.  of course along with Abby but you know giving her more flexibility to do other things in parallel but also for us as a team I try to understand how many hours could you spend in a job or the next two or next months or two months are also a deal or if you need to hire someone else in an attempt to finish all the design work that's that's a little bit of what we discussed last week and I just introduced to Abby and now I think it's time as to if you can show because my computer is updating something is not going anywhere so I can access that document if you could project for us and give a little bit of a brief about what we discussed and at what sort of plan actually it's a it's a proposal Abby is nothing completely  different from what we need or what fortify needs. But it's a way of trying to measure and understand the scope and everything that we need to do for the wrong.  So Zhuang, I'm going to introduce what we discussed. Got it. So basically, this is just a table of the same items we've been discussing so far.  And we've tried to organize it quickly to understand what matters the most for the launch and what matters for the launch, but is actually a little bit more vague.  there's two levels of two priority levels. One is priority level for launch, so things we need for launch. And the other is priority level for running the mirror session.  So basically, things that have a higher priority level on the mirror session, necessarily the things we're going to launch first, but there are things that we should get clarity on sooner.  For instance, the dashboard is not really high priority for me or because it's already being developed. Let me zoom out for a little second.  Basically, we have these things going on. There's a few things work in progress and there's a few things for on the to-do.  This relates a little bit with the conversation we had earlier today, but this was done before. So far so good?  Yes.

3:32 - A L
  Okay.

3:35 - João Landeiro
  One of the things that we have some questions, let's see is that okay, so audit and reporting, we assume at this stage that they have low priority compared to other things.  Is this accurate? Yeah, I think so.

3:56 - A L
  Cognite has come back and said they want to do ISO 14001. But we can probably do something offline for them.  So, yes, I would say third-party portal is higher priority than audit and reporting. That said, I think it would be higher than onboarding experience for admin users.  we talked, it depends on what you mean by that. We talked today around that new thing about the updated policies, procedures, and trainings page.  think that would come above. So, you know, you have risk management, third-party. So I think we should follow the order that you had before with third-party goes up higher above auditing and reporting.  then after that, do the updated thing, updated policy procedures and trainings. OK.

4:58 - João Landeiro
  So this is a good point. That's actually, I think, the crux of this discussion. When we talk about onboarding here, I assume that Mauricio gave us some context on how we came up with this table, when we made this list of things, we were thinking mostly on what are full packages of work that have value for 45, that really moved the needle, and that they are not just corrections or adjustments that they are like sizeable.  And this is why our thinking on this was onboarding is super important, not for the policies, it's for everything.

5:53 - A L
  And one of the things that that move forward, go ahead.

5:57 - João Landeiro
  No, didn't. was scratching my head. I don't think the betting internally was... So the first contact with the platform, right, is very rare that today we sign up for something and we're just dropped into the middle of that thing, right?  Platforms they ask is a few questions like what do you expect to use this for, what's your role, what kind of company you work at, that's up to you.  And our thinking on that was that if we collect that sort of information at the start of the whole thing, we can use that for many things that kind of feel like artificial intelligence and maybe they're even easier to create, right?  Quick example. For the admin user, when they start using the platform, if we ask them if they are pursuing ISO, for instance, we could later when they get into the...  policies or the controls area, we show, oh, based on your answers during the onboard, we have pre-selected these policies and these controls for you to work on because they make sense for your goals.  But this is a more whole platform kind of view on how it feels to join the platform for the first time, right?  So we are separating this in three POVs. So the first one is the admin user, which is where we've been spending I think most of the time for everything else on the platform.  But ironically enough, the admin user is the user that has the most context, right? Because they've been probably negotiating the platform and so on.  We also need onboarding for the employee and we also need onboarding for the third parties. the link for I need you to I need an onboarding for consulting companies that might do use us as a service I think that would be another one okay so but the idea the reason why I'm I'm showing you this now is that this is a more like package of work which is different from let's just correct the policies enter the entryway into policies right because I think the pattern we're trying to the stage we are trying to enter now is to also give you a little bit more predictability what's being you know designed and developed and trying to step away from the three days ahead of the time horizon of three days but to do that we  need to find something that is sizable and we can work on and solve the problem for the company. Onboarding seems to be that thing.  Yeah.

9:13 - A L
  Yeah, I think so. I think it just depends on like when you say sizable, like what is size, right?  in the cost-benefit analysis of the size and what do we need to market, right? So I think that's what we need to see if it's end up being a huge thing, then like unfortunately we just need to get the simplest thing and we need to do the onboarding manually, right?  And in that sense. obviously it would be, I agree with you, like if we can have this like designed and done in a good way so that we can implement it, it would absolutely make our tool a lot better.  just more I think about like, yeah, the timing and kind of what do we need to have right now, what is nice to have and all of these things like trying to get people on our platform and using it.  or not we have an manual on-boarding system or not, but I agree. I think these are important aspects that I would like to add them on the list.  yeah.

10:15 - João Landeiro
  Okay, so in terms of what this site visible mean, yeah, that's a very good question. So let's go, let's take this from the end.  The end goal, end situation we want to achieve, we want to reach is not doing this like quick fixes on the design with the dev team breathing down our necks and also making sure that we can design things that we do not have to redesign afterwards, especially because in the way this project is being built, think that's also good for you because it's less

11:00 - A L
  rework and less you know paying twice for the same thing and so to step away from that kind of quick reaction thing we would it would make sense to find what's like a big piece of work that we feel really pushes things forward and elevates the platform to another yeah not against that but again it goes back to like you say big piece of work or you're saying you know you have to have a lot that's like you know a month's worth of work full time to be able to build this or is this like just more than one or two days and this is like a week's thing or like I think that's kind of like I need to take into that into consideration because I can't afford three months full time just building you know right so but I can probably spend a week or two on it so I think it depends on like what you mean by how big and like how nice do we want to do it right like I think it's like one thing if we have a million under our fund  and then we can make it really nice and do all this. truth is like we have a runway that's going down every month that we don't have this product out that I can find in a good place, right?  So what is like the minimum that we can do that can get the product out there so that we can use it and it's not gonna be perfect and then we're gonna have to hand hold a lot but just to get it out and ready to have something to sell, right?  I think again, it goes back to like big and like are you able to do onboarding admin user in a couple of days which is more than like an hour or two that we've been spending on audit or reporting or do you need a couple of weeks, right?  I think that's where I would need to understand that to be able to make the decision on whether or not we can have it and we can work on it on this time.

12:46 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, the idea is not three months for sure but more than a week. More than two weeks reach or like three and what is it like?

12:54 - A L
  How many, how much can we for each of these? Two two weeks like for each of these like on ad war admin user for CEO admin like third party An employee so probably no probably not because there's there's some overlap in that right um But go ahead.

13:15 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, but uh on Thursday, I can't remember but I got to a point She asked, know Both two are when we don't know about Is there a way to predict how many weeks or how many hours or how many days and I think there are some parts of the platform that we need to Discuss first To design the journey itself.  So we are gonna go through this. This is the least we can do or You know, this is the minimum that can do the platform is ready and then we design from that and then you can Yeah And then you can Measure  The amount of time that we need to do because I think there are some parts that we don't have anything.  So what we are suggesting here is like, uh, we, we, we spend two or three days ourselves, make a design spring for those parts that we don't have anything and then all together can decide, you know, where do you go from that?  So are you going through the Rolls Royce or we are coming back to the Toyota again? So, but what does that mean for those journeys that are not designed?  I'm tense. that's the, the, the, the suggestion here is spent two or three days to design all this, uh, journeys that we don't have.  And then we do a wireframe for that. And then we agree about, you know, the usability and then we go to the design.  So that would be a process that would be very efficient for us as our previous experiences. So that's one of the things that we, uh, yeah, I'm not against that, but I think, again, it goes back to like,

15:00 - A L
  of that like what is the estimate because I do think that like I'm trying to recruit a new CTO and if I get a new CTO the one that I'm talking to we can likely raise VC funding because it's loved by all the BCs here that said he wants to build AI which I also want to do into our product so you think about our policies procedures and training as is right now there is a lot of opportunity for AI just actually you know training the AI and then the AI kind of pulls out your thing rather than use a template and copy it up so the question is like do we start now knowing that like in a after this summer we're going to change it which could be good because at the same time I'm going to investors right now and saying like hey we're building an AI tool and then they look at our tool that's not AI ready so is it actually better knowing that we're going to be changing like the onboard experience AI is it better to draw out what the AI could actually look like and then have the development team build that out and in the meantime I can kind of show like drawings and what like  Hey, if you fund us, this is where we're going and what we want to do. That might be better than doing the onboarding experience.  Because at one point, there's an onboarding of where our initial pilot customers were friends with them when we can do the manual onboarding.  It's not going to get any product-led growth aspect. given that omnibus regulation came in, I think our chances of product-led growth are going down a lot more.  It's going to be more, ideally, more expensive. We want to charge our product more expensive and then go to probably more customers like Cognite, Zenet, or Ardock, like larger customers that are willing to pay more and are OK also with hand-holding while we try to get the product out of the ground.  So I think that's also what I need to consider around that. But I agree. Like our investor said, we need a better onboarding experience for admin.  and the question is like, you know, are we able to do it in an efficient way? And I know that we're probably going to have to change it later, but the reality is like, because of omnibus and all the uncertainty, it's hard for us to invest a lot into this until we can start selling more, right?  So that's what I'm trying to figure out. What is the right balance of getting it to a point where we can actually, and that's why, you know, I kind of pushed for third-party risk management and that because I feel like I can sell that because that at least is most like, and then we can very manually do the auditing and reporting part, right?  But I do think that, so yeah, so that's kind of the piece. I guess it goes back to like the onboarding admin for users, you know, we want to change the entrance to policy procedures, trainings, controls, you know, how many more days is it to do the admin or is it very different?  part of the same thing that we need to work on. it makes sense that we do that, right? I agree that offering for third parties would be good because that's a good selling point for us when third parties have to go in and investors need to go into the portfolio and they have a good feeling.  but again, it's a month, it's a one week, it's a three days and what do we want in there?  complicated do we want to make it? then it also affects Yvonne and his team. I'm very dependent on them right now, but if we have a CTO come on board, might be a lot easier because they could do it themselves.  I totally agree with pieces needed, but it goes back to again. It's possible we can bang it out and spend the next month and I actually overextend on my budget to get this out, but then that means because we have this out then we don't need to have more.  We just take three months of planning that I have on my budget, bring it all in one month and you have one bang and everyone gets it out.

19:00 - João Landeiro
  the way and then you know we then I have less budget on the next couple months right that could also be a way I just kind of move the funding allocated like forward so yeah I don't know if this is the way I I I phrase this but this is less about us trying to you know sell you more hours and more about it's getting these cohesive work packages out so we're not this is not a conversation about let's try to sell more and more services in more to have it it's more about let's just not let's have a little bit of a longer horizon so we don't have to like for instance the integrity hub I think we're going down on the third version of of it and I feel that maybe at that time when we started doing the other versions it was soon and we didn't have to do that so  There's no point in trying to over-spoil spilled milk with. Now we know that sometimes we do this, that we try to fix a problem really quickly, and then we need to correct it even before clients actually use it.  So that's mostly the point here.

20:17 - A L
  Yeah, but I think, yeah, I agree, yes and no, but like for me, why I was trying to push the integrity hub, and I have, even though we have changed that, use that integrity hub even though it's not the right version in my sales presentation.  you know, like I can go to sales and like, okay, there's an integrity hub that you can go that kind of brags on the different controls and kind of understand what I'm talking about versus if I had no picture, right?  So I think that that's been hopeful there. And I don't know how much time I spent, but I agree, like I think that ideally, we would have been able to kind of do this all at once, but it's not, it's the kind of the same reason why like I would like some of the drawings that I can just show them off along the way.  Because my challenge is, and I think that caused all of this is I sort of... out of this product without having anything down, right?  So now I'm trying to catch up and get something down, but at the same time, it's kind of like, yeah.  But no, I agree. I don't think you guys are trying to stop me, but I think I got, I guess my point is like, I would love to do everything.  part of my product is like, I'd love to do it like, you know, really great thought out thought through and like kind of put everything in it.  But like the reality is I don't, don't have that luxury given everything that's going on, right? So it's like, I'm able to like, like kind of like the same thing with like the AI, like, you know, with that, like, it would be good to have some drawings of kind of possibly what it can look like with AI integrations or that.  I don't know how we do that without like an AI expert. I know Yvonne might have a person on their team like that could then draw it.  But then the question is like, when we actually go and build it, would be like, oh, why did we spend time drawing it?  Because now we have to really draw it because it doesn't actually make sense, right? But at the same time, I kind of need it, like, I will.  Going in to investor calls in the next month or two and I'm saying we're building our AI And then there's no kind of drawing or explanation of how the AI is going to work, right?  So One problem at the time because I came and build the AI thing until I actually get our current customers and I need them to convert on our current platform because they're not necessarily looking at the AI part yet so it's kind of like Yeah, it's just like Yeah Yeah, I get sure I think there are a lot, you know a lot of decisions to be made, you know at the same time we Many uncertainties Around and what to do next or what to do first?

22:44 - João Landeiro
  What's going to Really go to convert something but in you know If I may my from my experience I think we should pursue if you have the whole platform designed And  This is not going to take more than two months. Let's say this, I'm just guessing here, or we try to fit everything that we can do in two months, it depends on how you decide to do it.  But I think that's the compromise. Because once you have everything designed, the next step is just like to improve that.  There's no way back. So every kind of improvement that you do in some kind of journey, it's going to be good and it's going to be great.  otherwise we're going to just like pursuing our table all the time. And because there are some things that happen, because this is part of the startup kind of ecosystem.  Everything happens all the time and there are some changes. But I think that what we have right now is quite a lot.  There's a few things to do and my suggestion, my recommendation is for us to assume that compromise about... delivering everything design, and then you can go to Revan and decide what to develop first.  you know, let's have everything, all the screen designs at least, you know. That's one way of working, that I would say.  For that to happen, is there anything on our list that we need to do a design spring to workshop or something that, you know, design all the clothes, even for a measure, as said, as Evi just said.  So we are going to do, you know, the most incredible version of, you know, the onboarding or we are going to do this and this is enough.  I think it's a kind of a decision now that we can do as a group, because of course now we have more knowledge about the platform and, you know, the services and we are also connecting connected about what you are going to sell.  how you're going to sell. I think this is the time for us to sit and and do that. So the reason we are talking right now is like our proposal is this priority here.  I think we need to sit down for a couple of hours in the next couple of days or depends on your availability and then from our sprints for each part that we need to develop from scratch and you can evaluate how many hours how many days or weeks that we are going to have.  We don't have that you know precisely to say to you, we'll have 10 days or two months now because we need to a little bit more about you know all these parts that we need to develop to create actually no developments.  So what do you think about that? How are you in terms of availability?

25:54 - A L
  Yeah well I'm I'm happy to have like more sessions with y'all I think it's always good to have that and to put it down on paper and do that.  And that could be a question, is like, yeah, to get to understanding. I'm going to be in the US starting on Wednesday until next Friday.  But that's also could be good, just given the time difference. I don't know how far ahead of you guys are in California.  Four hours.

26:22 - João Landeiro
  Four hours, yeah.

26:23 - A L
  So then we could do your afternoon and my morning, which actually might work better, so that I actually have more time.  Because I don't like it normally is nine hours ahead. So it's like, when I start the day, I only can do the last two hours of Norway, given the time difference.  So then I have actually a lot more time during the day, the next 10 days, to kind of try to bust it out, try to, yeah, do all of it and kind of draw it out, which I'll to mirror it and then see how it would be.  then we can get an estimate of like, yeah, storyboard it or that there. But I don't like, I guess.  Yeah, so yeah to see how long that would take and then and then have an estimate of how long it would Take for Romeo to build these or decide whether or not we You know try to find someone full-time and just bust it out in a month or have Do it slowly and continue it on I guess So What are you thinking?

27:28 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, I think I think we we could do some sessions like that. I think the really important thing is that we try to Map it in a comprehensive way, right So the good thing is that so much is done now and there's not There's not so there are not so many let's say holes in the full experience Just opening the mirror here but But there's some Like even  if we don't even if we understand that so when we're talking about designing the whole thing or understanding at least on a broad level how everything connects to everything else that means you know the reporting and the audit as well that means the onboarding that means how I think the thing we don't want to do is get really focused on one specific area and get like really detailed on that but then realize that something else breaks because it connects to that area I can give an example a lot of what we do is related to test management right and we've been you know touching up on test management but more of a on an ad hoc kind of way right we don't have test management thing here

29:01 - A L
  We should have a text management, I think we had discussed that, I don't know what happened to it. Yeah, it never became a priority because we were always fixing other things and doing other things.

29:12 - João Landeiro
  But it's a core thing, it's like a spinal cord of the entire thing because people realize they have things to do, they need to track those things, they need to understand if they're on track to finish those things and so on.  So this is an example of something that we've never explicitly designed, but it shows up everywhere on the platform.  And the way we should approach that is to try to get that right and then see how it manifests on the other areas of the platform, Otherwise at the end things might not really click.  So that's an example, it doesn't look like a feature on our list, it doesn't look like any of these things.  But when you look at how it manifests itself in the system, it shows up time and time again.

30:00 - A L
  We have task manager, but I think some of this is like, yeah, we should add task management to the list.  And I think we can go through and map all of these. I think sometimes it's like, like we are in the stage that we can do this, because a lot of the tasks are assigned to controls, right?  Or to the policies, procedures, and trainings. It's the same thing with like integrity hub. Like, why are we able to kind of redo analysis?  We finally had the controls. When I first started talking about integrity hub back when like I think Romeo did in December, it was just a concept in my head.  We haven't even decided what the environmental controls were, right? So it's like, you couldn't even design it with that in because we didn't know.  And it's the same thing with kind of task management. now it's like, now we kind of actually know what our controls are and how we can set them up as tasks.  We can also design that into one with existing controls, but then one is a new section of new controls.  It's kind of like, we're literally building this as we go, because you think about like even carbon reporting. So I think that's the challenge so I do agree with you like if we did it earlier or like you know sat down if we like sit down and try to you know figure out what is missing in this and that can be very helpful in the kind of not doing like things ad hoc and I kind of like oh yeah we forgot to do this oh yeah we forgot to do this.  So I think that that that makes sense in it to do yeah.

31:30 - João Landeiro
  Cool so maybe we can just schedule a couple of sessions as we have been with the focus on those sessions to get not specific on one thing but like the whole map of the whole platform.

31:46 - A L
  I think the onboarding is like I do like how it's I would like either like that word document that you had I would just add task management to it and then I'd ask another one which is onboarding of consultancies because the way it  looking at a pivot, not a pivot, but like a more, I would say a focus of managed service through consultancies, like smaller consultancies that need a technology partner, and either we white label ourselves or they can manage multiple customers on the customer's behalf in our platform.  And then that's like, okay, what do we need to build in order to do that? You know, what would be the investment on that if we were to change that?  What would it look like, right? And I've seen this on Drotto or Vantat, that you're like a consultant has kind of their own entrance way into Drotto, and then they can kind of select which customers they manage on the behalf and then it pulls up, right?  I don't know how much that changes, but like, these are like, so it's like the onboarding experience for for a consultancy or something like that or a managed service, I'm not sure, but like I believe that that's a sizable thing because it can be done, everything can be done, but I believe it's a sizable thing because it interacts with

33:00 - João Landeiro
  things like user management from another there's another layer of user management like I'm a consulting company and I'm you know serving three different clients and those clients have their own users and their own groups so it's it's possible but I think this might be a little bit more complex than what it looks like on the surface and what I'm thinking about the consulting companies like so you've been having these conversations right you with different consulting companies is there anyway because these are new conversations that I take these are not things I think I've been talking with them for like six months but now it's getting more concrete I think one is because of the regulations that have deregulated a lot of consultancies are now like oh  what do we do also we need to find a way to sell so they're more eager to talk but also to because now we have a product to be able to kind of show them how it works

34:00 - A L
  So before, when I was talking to them, I was like, yeah, yeah, we're developing it was like with our it was like with our customers, right?  I didn't have anything to show them. Now I have something to show them in terms of like where they could look.  I'm not against also going in and try to create a pilot agreement with them. It's like, what would you need in order to work with us and to build that with it?  And we can have that discussion that's not a problem. It's more like if you want to have a to-do list of things that we need to do, I think task management and eventually onboarding of a consultancy one should be on that list just so we don't forget about it.  But I don't think yeah, we can start with the onboarding for admin and employees because in the meantime, because that's fine too, because at the end if a consultant wanted to work, they could just ask like to have five sites right in the meantime, right?  So we don't necessarily need anything immediately there, but I think it's something that we should just consider that we might need to pivot towards that.  So it could be ready so that when we decide like we could just like you know move to that.  I don't know but yeah.

35:04 - João Landeiro
  I think in a vacuum for sure having the onboarding experience for consultants ready and just being able to quickly pivot it in that I think I think that's interesting.  Given that we struggle with with capacity it seems to be like a very much kind of a just in case kind of thing that maybe the case doesn't materialize right so the way I'm looking at this is I'm thinking in these conversations with with consulting companies.  If the direction of those conversations is closer to customer discovery like tell me tell me more about your problems tell me more what's difficult more about what tools to use.  There's also a persuasive interaction taking place that does not depend on design work because the thing is we're not running away from work it's just that there's so much things to do that  we should avoid doing things that risk not being used.

36:06 - A L
  Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. We're not in those discussions yet, but I'm just saying, like you want to plan longer term, was saying that we want to have a plan long term, but yeah.

36:19 - João Landeiro
  Right.

36:20 - A L
  So yeah, I'm happy to have more sessions to talk through with these and to find out, because I don't feel like the sessions, whenever we have a session, not too long, maybe a couple of hours, and it's there to kind of go through each of these, which is also good to think through.  So I think if you're free then, especially when I'm in the U.S. with the time zones, I won't have many Norwegian meetings during the day in the U.S.  time. works out to have more of those then. So I think that might actually be in our favor.

37:01 - João Landeiro
  So maybe let's schedule at least two of them right away. Just for sure it won't be just a single one.  We can do it I think next week.

37:16 - A L
  I'll probably be jet lag on Thursday or Friday. Yeah. The following like Monday through Friday of next week. Pretty open, you know, starting.  I'm Yeah. Norway time. mean, not 99 California time. Or 8 a.m. California time. 5 p.m. 5 p.m. 5 p.m.  CT is what time there.

37:47 - João Landeiro
  So four hours ahead. One year one p.m. One p.m.

37:54 - A L
  your time. Yeah. 5 p.m.

37:56 - João Landeiro
  CT. 1 p.m. here. Okay.

37:59 - A L
  Yeah.

38:06 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, so one like 9 a.m.

38:08 - A L
  is no 9 a.m. Yeah 9 a.m. There is 1 p.m. Yeah, that's correct so starting 1 p.m. your time.  Mm-hmm.

38:19 - João Landeiro
  I can free or like even 8 a.m.

38:21 - A L
  self-piped jet lag so I'll probably be up pretty early. starting 12 p.m. your time.

38:27 - João Landeiro
  Okay, next week it's at 12 p.m. our time. It can be Monday, can you be Tuesday, can be both?

38:37 - A L
  I could do Monday actually because on Tuesday I have something from 5 to 6 30 CET but I CET, you can also do Wednesday and Thursday.  But can you put Oslo in there just so we can kind of add Oslo on the world time buddy thing?  Can you do three countries? Okay, yeah, because I have something, I have something from five to six on Tuesday the 25th.  But otherwise on Monday and Wednesday and Thursday, I'm pretty open at 4.30. But I can also do, let's see, end at 6.30 CET, which is 6.30 CET, which is 10 a.m.  Brazil. So I can still meet at, is it 6.30? End at, like, my seven. So I can meet at 11 a.m., which is also your 3 p.m.  on Tuesday. So, yeah.

39:49 - João Landeiro
  Sorry, I got confused.

39:50 - A L
  Can you break me on Tuesday? Okay, I could do, like, five to six, like, after, like, and we have the design sync at four at four, right?  I can meet after the design sync, okay? I'll need to have some lunch break.

40:05 - João Landeiro
  Yes, and I can meet at five, which is five p.m.

40:08 - A L
  my time, which is one p.m. your time. Yes. Yeah, we can do that.

40:17 - João Landeiro
  So five p.m. CET on Monday, which is...

40:24 - A L
  I'll send you the invitation right away. Yeah, and then on Tuesday, either we skip Tuesday and we go to Wednesday at the same time.  I can do that on Thursday, because I could do Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Or on Tuesday, I can do after 6.30 CET, which is...  a second. I'm not absorbing all of that because I'm sending invites.

40:51 - João Landeiro
  So on Tuesday, yes?

40:54 - A L
  Tuesday, I can do it after 7 p.m. Oslo time, which is three premier time and 11 a.m. My time so we could also do that Then or we can if you want to do it Like yeah three to five we could like you know your time three to five or we can do it on wednesday and thursday free From five to seven p.m See it.  Yeah, okay. I'm going to send you an invite now.

41:26 - João Landeiro
  Please check if it makes sense for the schedule On your side I think they can Set up two sessions and see how it goes Uh, say that we can do money and wednesday so we have a day to process everything that we Cover on the first session  and then we decide how to make progress with that because I don't like the idea of having three sessions in a week and then we have a lot of time to process that.  I think we could do a kind of an overview on the first session and then we can go to the other ones more specifically maybe.

42:24 - A L
  What overview do we mean in some of these? I feel like we've gone through several times like overview or like what are we building or what are we doing.  I feel like we've done that. If you don't like that picture that he was showing was kind of like a mapping of how.  Let's go with that.

42:50 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, yeah.

42:51 - A L
  Yeah, this is the map and that but I think I so I think three sessions is good whether it's Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.  So you have a break between Tuesday, Xiao, like if you feel like, I need to process after Monday. So then we can also do the, oh, the, could the Tuesday session, I can't do that time.  I think it's, you got to view. So the Wednesday, the 26th is the one I can do it on the seven PM.  So switch the day. So Wednesday, I can do the time you put at Tuesday and then Tuesday can do the time you put at Wednesday.

43:27 - João Landeiro
  I think your calendar didn't update it. has it been updated?

43:32 - A L
  Okay. On this side, it says CT here on the website. And so we have one for Monday, one for Wednesday.  Wednesday, I can do, I can, yeah, Wednesday, I can do five to seven PM CT. that possible?

43:54 - João Landeiro
  Okay. And then on Tuesday, I can do Tuesday or Thursday.

44:01 - A L
  I guess it depends on you to do Monday, Wednesday, Thursday then. Or yeah, maybe that's better. I need a little bit of breather here.

44:13 - João Landeiro
  So if this works for you, see if you got the invitation, For Thursday, the 27th. Okay, is that coming in, I guess?

44:36 - A L
  8 p.m., is that what you have?

44:39 - João Landeiro
  8 p.m. in Norwegian Dainese.

44:43 - A L
  Yeah, I think, and that's 12 p.m. the other time, right? So I think that should be p.m.

44:51 - João Landeiro
  the other time.

44:54 - A L
  Yeah, correct, yes.

44:58 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, I think that should be fine.

45:00 - A L
  I don't think I have anything that day. Yeah. OK, so Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, yeah. Perfect.

45:10 - João Landeiro
  OK, and so just to be sure, our objective with those conversations is to connect everything in the platform, right?  See if we find the blind spots and what's missing and so on. And we are sure to find, like session number one, we're sure to find like, oh, my God, we need to make this thing.  We should not change the agenda to fix that, right?

45:36 - A L
  But I guess the full mapping session, I was thinking we're going to go through some of the lists on your Word document, like the onboarding, like what could the onboarding look like?  What can the more tangible ones? I feel like spending so much time on just mapping the tool. I feel like we've done a lot on mapping the tool already.  We need more time. kind of all optimizing the tool. Maybe like the stuff that's missing is, yeah, I don't know.  Like if you look at your Word document, guess it's like, my thing is like when it says yes to Miro, no to Miro or whatever, like I would think that that's what we would do next week is like try to figure out needs a Miro session and work on kind of those next week.  And then from that maybe it then it's like okay now we understand what we're building on all of this and then we see like kind of the missing thread.  But I think it's, yeah, I think it's important to get to build some of these out.

46:39 - João Landeiro
  Got it.

46:47 - A L
  And maybe through the onboarding session, we'll flush out all these things that we don't have through, we'll do it.  I agree, task management we kind of forgot about, but I'm trying to think like What else are we missing in the tool?  It's kind of all the boxes that we have. And it's like that thing of like, you know, that new onboarding, whether you call the thing that we discussed today in terms of like the policies, procedures, trainings, control.  If that's going to actually be in the onboarding experience, that's kind of like a encompassed in that, then that's even better.  Otherwise, to discuss the policies, procedures, trainings, one, and what that means.

47:38 - João Landeiro
  If we go deep into each of these things, we will just be replicating the same process we've been doing so far.  So we can do that, but we'll be, I think, back to the process we've been following so far. So what it can do, I think now we have a plan to do those sessions.  From now to next week, we can sit down and try to think about a process during the session that we can be more specific and more straight to the point to take most from the sessions and everything.  Let's think about a better way of doing that than running those sessions. Yeah, because we can sit down and you do this week map what we know or what you don't know and how you're going to tackle everything that you know it's already been doing or what's from scratch and then let's see we can discuss until next Monday.  Yeah, because I agree with both of you I think because it's a very complex platform and there are so many things you know we try to we tend to  I away from you know some specifics but we want exactly the opposite which is like okay let's make a this task force to get everything on the paper and then design all the things that we need to design so let's keep that in mind you know otherwise we are gonna be following the the tail again so yeah it's an exercise it's not easy.

49:25 - A L
  I think like what I see like in Xiao I kind of agree with you but I kind of also don't agree with it like we are doing the same process but like if we have three mapping sessions or we get in all of the mural sessions in one go we'll be able to see the tool holistically and what are we missing right one of the challenges we have is like we go section by section and then if we kind of do the onboarding for all of these different things on how we would ideally like it or even auditing or reporting whatever is missing then it's kind of like okay we have we kind of see and then we can see how it all fits together like more holistically  because we thought through the rest of the remaining things, right? So I think that's my thinking too, and that can be everything.

50:12 - João Landeiro
  Yeah, that's one of the reasons that I've been sitting about the mapping, that you put on the mute board.  So maybe one way of doing the sessions is designing, you know, the flow, you know, and see how it connects to other sessions and, you know, what do we have or what do we don't have.  So it's a way also to make that happen because now we have an overview. When I say about, you know, understanding all the parts and seeing a picture, I think that would be a very quick run through the whole thing that is on the mute board and then you see how we can design all the sessions and run the sessions towards each part that we need to reformulate or formulate.  So that's that way. Okay, because you know as as you did you know on the map you know you connected the dots and you made the links for all the sessions and what is common in different parts of the platform so that I think that's the easier way this is easiest way to do that and especially one of the things about having a map everything you know just like laid out is about everybody that comes in to what if I can understand the whole platform as a whole you know it's easier for you know from a UX perspective to have this map for everybody that wants to you know run to everything and we don't have everything already developed but yeah let's think let's see how to make document in terms of like design package that almost even add one more line to it is like AI you know like AI integrate because I think that eventually that will need to be drawn in but this is kind of a good like adoption

52:00 - A L
  And to kind of like, every time I remember something that we eventually need to build, like you said, on-boarding consultant maybe does not need to build now, but like, to have that discussion about AI, like, or things that we might want to do and put on the list so that we kind of have a keep track of it.  Because, like, yeah, we had a track for task management and we discussed it and then we forgot, like, we didn't have like one, like, key place to put it.  And I think maybe you had created an Excel, but we stopped using it, but like, having a place for that, because I do think AI will need to, some kind of drawing of AI is going to need to happen, even if we don't necessarily develop it.  But it doesn't come in priority before some of these ones in there.

52:49 - João Landeiro
  All right. Understood. So we have a plan now. We do. Okay. And I think the next steps are based on next week.  can evaluate how many time we need and how much effort we need and then we can give you a more concrete timeline and also you know the investment that you are able to do or not so I think that's what we need to do right now and we have you know you have quite a lot to do that so it's good okay yeah I think this is a good start point for that and then yeah we can see from there how to make it work okay okay then all right thank you okay thank you bye bye let me say this like a sin you
