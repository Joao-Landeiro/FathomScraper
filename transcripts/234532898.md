0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes good. How about you?

0:03 - brighton
  Good, good.

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you. Just doing some housecleaning. That's a very Peruvian background. Have you been to Peru? No, I haven't.

0:36 - brighton
  I haven't been to US before actually. I always wanted to visit. I've never visited Peru either.

0:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think, was it last week? Yeah, last week I was talking to someone that went to Machu Picchu like ages ago.  Back in the time where you could camp really close to the ruins.

1:00 - brighton
  and that felt real like some Indiana Jones thing right?

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She didn't do it, she didn't do it, but it was it was a possibility and I was like oh this.

1:13 - brighton
  From Singapore to the US to America, it's really long. I think to go to Peru is around maybe eight, nineteen, twenty hours.

1:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah I I guess. Hello.

1:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hello Yvonne. We were talking about traveling so this this time it was Peru.

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Peru.

1:39 - brighton
  That's really nice.

1:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Are you traveling there or?

1:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no it's just because of Brighton's background.

1:45 - brighton
  Ah cool.

1:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  Where are you guys based in?

1:52 - brighton
  So I'm in the south of Brazil.

1:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh I'm in Croatia. Wow.

2:00 - brighton
  Nice, I always want to play. Yeah, yeah, pretty international, I would say. Yeah, and have you guys came to Norway before?  No, no, never, I would never.

2:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Never actually, Northern Europe in my wish for some time, never, it never comes from the agenda. So, yeah, maybe sometime we'll see.  Yeah, yeah, Okay, do you know Brighton if Fabi is coming, maybe did you talk to her today?

2:36 - brighton
  Yeah, I talked to her today. She didn't mention anything about it, so I'm sure she would be coming. I know she's quite, she was quite sick just now.  Oh, okay. Yeah, maybe I could send her a message. Mm-hmm, yeah.

2:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just, um, okay. Hello.

3:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hello. Hello.

3:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we're speaking about people being from all over the place, right? So right now here is summer and it rains a lot.  Maybe it's the same in Singapore. It gets really hot, really humid. Yeah, it's hot the whole time. And do you get like these strong rains every day around kind of the same time?

3:45 - brighton
  I think maybe in one week it will rain maybe three times. OK.

3:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because right now we have like this either it rains once and it's really like the sky gets black, it becomes morbid.  And then rain in minutes later it's all done or you just get this every six hours bit of rate oh that's a lot of rain yeah I guess it's uh because this this city is also a kind of a let's say wet city it rains a lot here that's why it was for that okay so uh even if Evie might not join at some point since we have Romeo here maybe we can yeah so I'm sharing the the screen now on JIRA I know there's nothing in review specifically but for me oh hey good day good morning and do you have anything that's walking you something you need more clarity on so let's check a little bit of progress on this yeah on this thing  if you guys remember this was about finding a way to approve a form like I sent a gift form but maybe I didn't write the correct information in and the compliance officer should be able to say hey try again right so okay my research is explaining what I'm seeing you're not seeing it well, it's not pretty yet but I'm working on the there's no problem with that all the videos are closed I'm sorry no worries  Yes, we are safe. So I'll just log in into what we have right now and maybe use that to compare with the Figma.  Maybe it's easier. Okay, okay, signing, share the step. nice map. Controls. One, two, three. Okay, controls. So see what Romeo was showing on Figma was what you see when you click here, on see all requests.  Okay. And let's go back to the Figma. Yeah. This is just a placeholder, it will have more details for the run.  Same thing here.

7:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  That would be one minute.

7:08 - Romeu Rodrigues
  This is a list, right? And then, from what I saw in the because it is in production, there is no Actions, right?  Or a button to approve an algorithm. Then I thought about putting Actions for now, because it not right? We can also think about how it would be for the plugin itself, right?  Yeah.

7:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so we would have the three dots here, maybe for Actions. Maybe it is now empty because there is nothing here, right?  yeah. And so, review and approval. Let's say, let's role play this. I am a compliance officer. You, Romeo, are an employee.  You just sent me a form, right? Any form. And I see... Are showing Figma or...

8:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  yeah okay thank you thank you that's very kind so rewind let's say i'm a compliance officer and i've just received the form that is filled in and i can see the answers here correct i see all the answers and then i can say i approve or i do not approve either way i can add comments here like i can say i have a really good job or this sucks you need to do it again either way i'll just approve is the component you can easily reuse go ahead i have sorry one comment we are missing in the previous design maybe it's on purpose we just want to bring it up that that's missing from the current is we had some kind of a timeline a top not timeline a stepper we said one two three first one was submission the second one was line manager and the third one is admin approval you can see it in the previous design if you want i can link it then i will try to enable our progress and i couldn't i want to create a submission so that we can test this  in the real app but I want to show you no no no let me show you what I'm talking about so the page that you're showing to me in the old in the current system looks something like this big nice loading you can find me on Figma please I found you okay good so now wait for loading I think it's on the top of the screen yes this is the screen so I'm more than fine with your design it's just a question of if you need something like this for visibility yeah this is more or less how it's implemented but other other parts are okay yeah and this just tells you that who is also reviewing because with this same page you show me will be review one and review two can be it will be a pretty similar page right so  how to make the difference between the two steps, that's a question.

10:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, Rumeu, can you add this?

10:10 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Can I use the one we created?

10:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go there and click on your face and I'll find you.

10:28 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Wow, this is it.

10:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what Rumeu was asking is if we can use this sort of visual component. I got to say I prefer Ivan's version because this one we use it more to guide people through the phases of the forms and the other one is more about the process of approval and I think it's useful to just have different ways of  Like, not having everything look the same way, right? Yes, yes.

11:04 - Romeu Rodrigues
  And we have both components.

11:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay.

11:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Aha, he's meaning this.

11:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I would maybe, but it would be better maybe because we already have that one. And if it could fit in the design, that would be a bit better.  But of course, if you think it won't fit in, then I'm fine with something else. You should suggest it.  Okay.

11:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Part of it is my fault. I'm sorry. Romel, just to be sure, super guaranteed. If you want to find out whether this is key, this is the key, right?  Yes, that's fine. Okay. Okay.

11:41 - Romeu Rodrigues
  So that's my mistake.

11:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  made a mistake. Now, second question is, if we use these tabs to talk about the progress of the approval, does that mean that when I click this tab, I check all the comments that were made at this stage and I check this  and see all the comments that were made at this stage and so on. I mean, I think it's interesting.

12:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  would keep it simple. would just have like page looks the same. It is just the status that gets updated through that UI.  So I don't know, if you are at line manager review, then the line manager review selected as current step.

12:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And that's it.

12:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  I will keep it as simple as that for now. I agree. I would just bring this in then.

12:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. OK, OK. Let's use this. go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. OK. Effective.  And where are you, Hummer? Tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, tu, I remember doing streaming, probably have a lot of social networks.

12:54 - Romeu Rodrigues
  OK, OK.

12:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, we would put that thing here at the top. approval pending and then we have this confirmation. Is this roughly in the direction we need to move?  Yeah.

13:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. Perfect.

13:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. this stays in progress because there's still something just to be made. Rumeu, any other thing you want to show?  No, now, no.

13:25 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Highlight on top would already be visible to those who are soliciting approval, right? Would it be possible for them live in an additional approval day?

13:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll follow you.

13:37 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Go there, I'll find you. When I pass the registration to add who will approve, would it more or less us?  This is not the scenario of any solicitor for approval.

13:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't understand. How do learn about the solicitor for approval?

14:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I don't know if I got it wrong or not, but here there is a of who will approve and there is a scenario of who created a form and requested for approval, right?

14:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, but the person who requested for approval doesn't see who is the approval. No, I don't have a professional profile.

14:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  For now, yes, simplicity sake, yes. While you are submitting the form, add your line manager in, because it would be, for now, it's a bit more complex to get right all the comments.  structure of hierarchies and stuff, so in theory we wanted to avoid it by you selecting your own line manager while submitting.  Absolutely, got it. So Romeo, you were correct, you were not wrong.

15:14 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, no.

15:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Romeo's question was, do I already get a list of my line managers and no, the point is that we don't know who your line managers are at this stage?

15:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  Any user, any user, so basically it's user select for now. So I have a list of all the users.  It's all to complete the same component we have all over the app, so you just select user from the dropdown and that's it.  Like I think it's all to complete or something. Okay, so that's good.

15:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. So on that we are good to go. Rumeu, how are we doing? Carbon reporting is still on, right?  Because we asked to stop. Or not?

16:12 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It's still on for the time being, I'm going to give the same answer to this one. I got it, and I'm going go back to other stars.

16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ok, then, as soon as you Carbon reporting... Ok, so as soon as you finish those, you can focus on the Carbon reporting.  I think that's it. I'm starting to get confused a little bit on Carbon reporting, because we've discussed this so many times.  Just to be, you know, full proof. My current understanding of the Carbon reporting is this. I'll share this tab.  Where is Carbon reporting? So carbon reporting is a part of controls, I believe, let me open my Figma. Okay, yes.  So carbon reporting is part of controls. Within carbon reporting, we have some kinds of things, right? Please correct me if you see me saying something that's wrong or that's .  Just don't make it absolutely, sure. And where am I? We'll just stop following you, Romeo. And then controls. Okay, so we then have  OK, so we then have this flow, because carbon reporting is part of the control, is this correct?

18:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes. OK, I still feel that way, right?

18:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so we now have this design view of the control, which was a simplified version of the control.

18:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  You're showing my role, by the way. Thank you.

18:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so we now have the simplified view of the control, which is this, not this, perfect. And we need to convert the different bits of this Myro, these different things, into Figma files.  But we can put them together, there's no point in trying to explain everything now, but we can put them together based on components we already have, which are basically these components, right?  vein before, dual option which is relatively easy, we don't have that here yet, and then confirmation with a simple summary or confirmation with a longer summary.  this means, Romeo, are you picking? Okay, so this means we will then create those forms to fit in this, okay.  So if we design the main components, if we just put them in the sequence, the main components of each control, let's say, purchased energy, chilled water, purchased heat and steam, each of these things is small, okay.  So for instance, purchased energy, there's like an explanation, yes, I get it. Next stage, and two ways of doing it.  I want to do it around the consumption or I want to do it around the spinning so we don't have an element.

20:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  So it's both training and control here or I mean not trying to confuse you but from what I see it's a video with some kind of information that you can learn from and then immediately or what's the purpose?  I understand your point. This is not a fit.

20:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is a poorly designed button. is just a let's Thank you. So like intro, intro.

20:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay.

20:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was just confused.

20:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  Nothing else. It's all no problem because sometimes other people could have the same interpretation.

20:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's good. So then there's there's a pain. We will design this, right? But basically, there's two ways of inputting the purchased energy is either about the spending.  So I say the amount in the currency or it's about the consumption and I say the amount in the units.  Okay. And then at the end, I have a confirmation. Oh, you're spending or you're just included this much purchase stuff, right?  but the logic is the same there's always a little bit of an explanation especially for the newbies right oh chilled water it is about this thing and it matters because of this thing yes i'm ready let's go and then we have to form itself right here and then we have the confirmation but my point is so to me this makes sense and to me this makes sense so my kind of my my my confusion now and who may have this question for you too is can we just adapt those questions to this design and can we can we just adapt those questions for this design okay even would this be easier for you guys you

22:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  With questions we can do whatever we want, but it's the question of these info panels for each screen that will be a bit interesting to do, but we can figure something out.  I can maybe show you after the call quickly how we can achieve this with our library and you can also see yourself, so that will help you design it because then you'll know what we can if you want.

22:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because now that I'm talking to you I'm thinking about something else, which is let's role play this again. So I'm a compliance officer, I'm filling in a lot of information about carbon emissions, right?  And there's about my cars and my generators and my electricity, all these sorts of things. And this information is spread out across different sources, different people, they don't have it in an email, I don't have it ready.  I will have it once I use Fortify, but I don't have it now. So if we put all of those different information spread out and steps is  form such as this, right? But if I don't complete them, the status for that form, I think it's a little bit more abstract, right?  Oh yeah, four out of five are done, right? This is a bit weird, it feels to me. And what I'm thinking is it might be easier to track if we, instead of having one form that is made of small sections, we have a lot of small forms that we can just say, this is done, this is not done.  You know what I mean? Let's, let's think, let's, let's think menu so that we don't maybe waste our time.

23:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  I will show you what we can and then you can go over to Romero and translate it to him.  I think maybe the best.

23:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. Yeah, if you can, we can do it immediately after the call.

23:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can use the five minutes that's left in here to do that. And I will show you what we can build very easily.  So you'll get more ideas for that. Okay, I like your suggestion of releasing a release.

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  everyone and we're just taking five minutes to do it. So if there's no more questions, we can do that.  How do you guys do? Okay, so yeah, let's do it.

24:19 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, thank you. How much time do you have, Jean?

24:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  10, 15. Okay, more than enough. Okay, I'll try my screen now.

24:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  Brighton, you can leave if you don't want to listen. Thank you. So yeah, I know you saw this, but just to show you, this is the library that we are using.  This is the form builder, server builder. This regard, let's make this more simple. So we're using this library to build forms and we can have multiple pages in here.  And then when you implemented Then it looks, oh, I'm sorry. Let me just do something quickly. Quiz mode. Okay.  Now, when I go into preview, I have it. This is what we have by default. This is that library that this library allows us.  it has this progress tracking. And then I click next and then it goes to next page and so on.  So this is what we can achieve with this. The only show I see here is how we can achieve those info stuff.  That's what I'm, you know, we can have page numbers here. So this is like a form builder. We don't have this in the application, but we have this preview part.  whatever we can build in this designer, we can easily achieve in the code or, sorry, one more. Here we have these pages, but you cannot, for example, progress page until you fill in.  Questions, of course, can be all the types. And design will be similar to this one. Not sure if you are following.  No, I am, I am.

26:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll paraphrase just to make sure. Yes, we have the, the assembler or the form maker, which is great.  I'm sure the form maker has some sort of like text box, not input field, but like a text box where I can put information and I can write anything there.  Yeah, they have HTML, I think I used it.

26:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, they have this, for example, we can use this only for info stuff, for example, and then we can write something in here, but we are a bit limited here.  So I wouldn't want to do too much. Yeah, I wouldn't want to do anything, just the B elements, paragraph stuff.

26:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, something like that.

26:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  can try, try like that. then, oops, pause, and then press info, description, blah, blah. And then, and then it looks like this.  It's shown here. It's not the prettiest, but this is something we can easily achieve without doing anything special. And here users can navigate through pages like this or like

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  give this or of course if you fill in but yeah you get the point and then like this so yeah we also have this this has a bunch of options so we can in theory whatever we can configure like this it it can it's very simple for us to do so we can have programs bar above the header below the header blah blah no that I think I end that and I think that's very useful but perhaps I didn't explain my my question really well which is in terms of a use case right imagining people using this thing I think it's very likely that we people will need to come back to the forums to put in more information right like oh I open a form and then I realize oh what is it I need okay okay and then they go back and they try to do it and they go back and forth to the form and at some point the form has all the information and it's done but until it has all the information that form yes as a control

28:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's not finished.

28:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That task is not okay.

28:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes.

28:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I'm thinking is if if the task of filling in carbon reporting is made up of 20 questions and I have 19 it means that it is incomplete for all intents and purposes it's not done right and if the person needs to navigate inside of a big form that a lot of different sections to find what is missing I think is more likely that they forget it.  So I think it's probably best if we just show them a list of the sections that are missing for instance maybe this will communicate better.  I want to know what you think about this. So as usual this is just an illustration is abstract right but what I'm thinking is that instead of saying carbon reporting here right I think it should say carbon  and reporting slash energy carbon report slash vehicles carbon reporting slash heating, you know, because in that way, I can know.  Yeah, this is really a mental model kind of thing. But do you understand my question? I don't know if I explained it correct?  Yes, I am. I am.

29:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  But I'm not sure if it would be smart to maybe make it same as us to split the one control multiple controls.  That's what you're trying to do here is to split the carbon emission into different parts by different sub controls or whatever.  It's kind of asking for trouble, right? I have a feeling that maybe we can achieve it like this for now, we can achieve it with this form and pages.  And then when you come back to the page, we can show you what what questions are not answered on each page.  For example, I would just highlight it like code red. maybe we can start with that for and then later if we see the need we can split it up because here I think hold on this is on the top I can play with this uh so progress bar type you can see answer progress bar blah blah blah table of content left right review before submit you can even have reviews okay edit answer blah blah blah next page okay that's it the only question is now so when you're going to preview okay we go next then we here you can see how many questions you've answered so when I type something it's one out of four but this is not helpful we need to know on which page so I'm now looking for if I can somehow know on which page uh but I can check that out maybe on validation sorry you know this much no it's you're afraid to to suggest I I'm always searching we can even search here but after that

31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so basically, I think the decision we arrived is, yes, one big form, it's best. But we need a way to highlight what is incomplete or incorrect.  Yes. And the worst case scenario, we can probably just dynamically make a list of, you need to answer question one, two, and three, right, instead of like, that we can always do.  Yeah. And also, for example, if you try, they won't be able to submit the service.

31:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  imagine they come in here, and they won't be able to go further than page two because they missed this question, or we can make this question because if something is required, you cannot go to the next step until you input it.  So we can talk about it if something is required, we can maybe allow progression, but between pages, but we can, we will not allow a service submission, maybe.  Okay.

31:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I like that behavior. Because in that, in that way, if I'm blocked with... Heating I said, I don't know the answer for heating, but I know let's see what's next Oh, there's something about cars cars I know and I feel in it and I can move almost towards the end, but then I cannot submit it Yeah, yeah, I think I managed to do it now.

32:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Now we go through all the pages I did not put in page two is now invalid So I go here and our preview.  This is just the preview of my answers and then I click complete It brings back the page to it so I cannot complete it, but I can move between pages.  That's Example we can and we can have all this as I'm saying is either because this is just to understand maybe you'll understand it better But basically this is this is the output.  We take this we put this into our database and then the user sees this Sees this pre-part. So that's how we do it and then they will see these pages Yeah, we do a little bit of styling on this, but that's it mainly for now Now that Don't like to submit final answer.  Okay Yeah, so in theory if we could put something like this in and it works for cover reporting will save a lot of time on the development side for right now and probably on design also because you don't need to design this stuff we are fine if we agree on how this flow works you can just design one screen and say something like that yeah or you can use screenshots from this here part.  Got it. Perfect thank you for this time this was useful I think yeah okay yeah okay yeah if you have any questions about this let me know but but theory I mean whatever you can do on this server builder so this is their server builder which we'll sooner or later have in our app so this layout if we if it's if it's configurable through here we can have it easily in in our solution that's it good okay

34:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're good to go. Ivan, Homie and I will just sync up on this item. Yeah, no worries.

34:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  If you have questions, ping me and that's it. Got it. Thank you. Have a nice one. Bye bye.
