0:16 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Hey, there we go. Hello.

0:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hey, man.

0:20 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  How are you? Good.

0:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. How are you?

0:23 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Doing well. Doing well. Yeah. What's been happening since last week? To come again? What's been happening this last week?

0:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I closed the new project, wrote a few things, organized a little bit of my website. know, all of these little open loops, but I think it's just part of the course.  It's like the never ending like 15 items on the to-do list.

0:53 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I never reached them. I'm kind of thinking. There we go. There we go.

0:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Some of these have been transferred. places from one index card to the next one for like a week or so.

1:04 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  100% yeah I never I never even make a dent in my to-do list I just move it to the next day and it becomes future me's problem and like  that.

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At some point did the glare of and just say I need a new project.

1:19 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah. Well dude like yeah it was cool to chat with you last week and like get a peek behind the curtain of like what you're building it and what the process is and seeing how like yeah like aligned we are and like you know what makes me a good workshop.  No one's ever done that before but I understood the reference immediately. I mean yeah like what's what did we want to go through today?

1:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I said that if you wanted to I offered if you wanted to I know like get my my opinion on something show me some  something, you show me your social mind, so I would be helpful, no strings attached, just want to keep talking to you, learn more from you, this is also useful to me, so it's the win-win.

2:15 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  All right, all right, nice, well, let me pull up, then my thing, we've only got 47 minutes, so let me, I'll talk you through, I'll talk you through my sales deck essentially first, so that it's at least framed up what I offer to people and how I offer it, and then actually what I'd love to get your thoughts on is like,  Like, what would be a potential, like, one-off-toe-dip, a kind of workshop that I could develop, that's not like a big, you know, five-figure project immediately, but something that can more like, you know, you can like test, drive, test from themselves.  Mm-hmm.

3:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, perfect. I've been noticing that a lot of people ask for this. So, this topic of, I like the name-toe-dipping.  I've been calling it like a starter workshop, but I think-toe-dipping is really a good name for that. So, yeah, I mean that zone, so I'll be, I'll enjoy doing that.

3:47 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  All right, well, I'll share my screen. Let's just load the screen. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it, like, yeah, I'm not surprised that there's a lot of people talking about it.  It does kind of make just kind of make sense, because it's kind of hard like with, it's kind of the only way to do like a trial run, like a, it's not a free sample, but like a paid sample for services, really, or whether or not it's going to be worth it until after you've experienced it.  So kind of the only way, but I think it's a good solution to get people thought into the logic process and like show off your expertise, show that you're like a real person, you can do real stuff.  All right, so I'm showing screen here. So I only work with essentially like professional services firms, who are, and on my phone,  on my form that they fill out my website, one of the questions is, do you take in at least 1 million ARR per year in revenue?  And that one little question has been such a game changer for me in terms of not only filtering out the people who aren't the right fit, but reassuring the people who are that are coming in this guy, this is real deal here.  And so it means that when I can get on a call with them, it means I can be very, very specific in my messaging.  And especially for services, you can tell me if you agree with this, but because people are only really you.  What saying before, people cannot experience the value of the service until after they've experienced it. for instance. Not only that, people aren't really purchasing a product from you then, a product and service, I'm using the same kind of label, because they don't know if it's worth it, all they can know is the philosophy that informed it, whether or not they agree with that philosophy.  It's a perspective that informed your unique approach, that is what they're actually buying. That's the only thing that you can actually promote in your marketing, is the perspective that informed your approach.  And so, when I say your perspective is your product, I mean that literally, that is literally what people are buying from there.  They can get similar outcomes from everyone and everyone's promising the same outcomes, but it's a perspective that informed your approach to that outcome that they're actually purchasing.  I agree, it makes me a lot of sense to me. I usually explain that in a more economic way, but we'll go with that today.  Zooming out like, when we talk about marketing, think about marketing as well, we think it's one thing, it's really two things, right?  It's the user journey, and it's the compelling content, like the user journey, like the stages that they go through, from a stranger to a client, and then the words and pictures that we show them, like the content make.  of marketing is just words and pictures, and I think this is captured quite elegantly in the funnel, which isn't how humans actually go through, it's not so linear, but there are distinct critical stages and touch points that people will pass through in order to go from stranger to a client or to someone who wants to work with them, and so really the challenge isn't setting the funnel up, it's not like building the scaffolding or the plumbing, it's making the funnel worth traveling down, and that, creating that motivation, that's where messaging comes.  into the plate. If we have muddy messaging, is where we get the leaky tunnel effect, but when it's clean and crisp and clear, that is when things just really start to flow.  This is why I'm of the strong belief that actually most marketing problems are just messaging problems in disguise. When we get the messaging right, things start to fall into place.  The problem though, how it's all too determined messaging is quite explored. You've got all of these frameworks. got your purpose, vision, mission values, your people don't buy what you do.  buy why you do it apparently. The brand archetypes that you are an explorer brand like Jeep or an hero brand, Nike or just a brand like men's.  then we've got the story brand framework, which is like your customers look skywalk or everyone guiding them to victory.  I mean, I don't know about you actually, but like the The thing, I have used and believed in and tried to make work each one of these frameworks in the past.  And they just don't. You just end up kind of like navel gazing on like the soul of your brand, rather than kind of coming up with anything that you can actually turn into proper marketing material.  Mm-hmm.

9:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Especially the top two, I think they are very inwards looking. And the second part little bit more outside.

9:28 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  So I'll throw it in. Yeah. Brand, brand Docker types, I think, is like at least it's kind of thinking about how you are perceived, but it still doesn't lead to like, well, are we going to make content about?  are we going to promote ourselves? What should we say? of like, you know, heroes of life. I think it's maybe for a B2C kind of mass consumer brand.  works for B2B. No. Sorry. And sorry, brand is missing a critical element. It's okay, but. It kind of treats the reader as if they don't have any complication, like sell the benefit of going to the dentist without acknowledging that there are like 40 other dentists all in the same catchment area, so they're selling the benefit of going to the dentist.  So the good news is that like, well, like really, there's a sharp process that's kind of required to kind of get what we need to really extract the right messaging so that we can actually turn it into marketing material that motivates people down the funnel.  And that process is something that really isolates your differentiation, like finding like what is the thing that you do that nobody else does that is meaningful and compelling.  And then we want to turn that differentiation into like a strong perspective, like what is The thing that you can say that your competitors are not saying that your customers need to hear.  And then we use that perspective to reinforce it through every critical touch point in the funnel. So it's all cohesive in one strong journey.  And the way that we do that is from a very clever framework from this guy, can each hear my, who was the president of McKinsey in Japan for like three decades in the post World War II kind of through an period that Japan went through, where they had like 10% of the resources that Western companies had, but were like dominating markets across like manufacturing and automotive and technology, like dominating them.  And he wrote a book called like the Mind of the Strategist because he kept getting asked like, how come you guys are able to compete so well with so with like 10% of the resources that we have.  he's like, we're just better at strategy than you guys are pretty much it. And his big legacy is the 3C's model.  And that is like, I mean, when I saw this, kind of changed my life. But the 3C's is from this guy, or is your model?

12:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's from this guy, and it's from this guy.

12:17 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And it's really a very, very, very clean distillation of the only three elements that actually matter. It's customer, company, Or to kind of like translate it and make it a little bit more lame.  And when we say customer, what we really mean is what your buyer wants. When we say company, it's what you are uniquely equipped to deliver.  And when we say category, it's what they cannot get elsewhere. What your buyer wants that you can deliver, that they cannot get elsewhere.  And it's at the center of this Venn diagram. That is where your perfect message resides. That's where it lives.  And so kind of like it's a little bit more real-world. I'm walking through this, this is what I take them through and I'll tell you after that like it's fascinating to see the results of this little experiment.  So I'm like, all right, it's 2001, your Steve Jobs, very clever guy, and that made it be around by all accounts, very clever guys.  The iPod is launching tomorrow, we need a tagline for it. People come up like, okay Steve, how about the iPod, listen to music on the go?  And you're like, that's okay, but it's missing one of these three elements, which one would you say it's missing?

13:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it doesn't address the third one, the category, what they cannot get elsewhere.

13:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Right, exactly, like the Sony Walkman's around and it's like, there's a million ways to listen to music on the go.  It's not, they can get that solution elsewhere. So that's ruled out. The check guy comes up and he's like, okay, well, how about this, a five-peak-of-ite-endy three-player.  And you're like, well, that's also missing one of these three elements, which one would you say?

14:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the top one, the thousands on your pocket sort of thing. Exactly, yeah.

14:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  like five-peak-of-ite-endy three-player, they don't want, it's not what they want, they don't even know what that means, especially in 2001.  They can't perceive that of the value of that. And so what they ended up going with was, of course, 1,000 songs in your pocket.  And this, to me, is like messaging protection. It's exactly what the buyer wants, that Apple could deliver, the buyer could not get elsewhere.  And so really, when I'm working with my clients, I'm trying to find like, what is your 1,000 songs in your pocket, what's the center of that then diagram for you?  And yeah, the amount of people that I speak to her own marketing firms, marketing experts, who completely beef that little mini exercise of which one isn't missing out of these three options is insane, like a lot more than you'd think.  It's like very basic marketing theory, but they beef it, and it's wild to watch it. But I guess it's why they hire me.  So at this point I'm like, cool, well, I'll show you this some examples of this process in action and finding the center of this Venn diagram.  This is a marketing agency that I worked with in California, they're based. Very ambitious guy, who's founded it. He hired 15 people before they had any clients in the door, and it turns out if you build it, they will not come and say he was leading money every single day, and they were leading with this very undifferentiated message, right?  And the ambitious is an interesting word, but yes, it's a kind word. And so you reach out to me and it's like I need your help to like figure out how we get our message to market though, like you don't have the message, but let's build one.  And what really stuck out to me was this public relations piece because I was like, you know most school service marketing agencies don't actually offer public relations, but you guys do looks like the deal with that.  He's like, yeah, not only do we do that, we do it better than most dedicated PR firms because they just do like the spray and pray press release thing.  Whereas, like I've got relationships with journalists, I can get out of clients published in relevant publications that their customers would actually be reading.  I was like, there we go, that's our output in the door, that is like the angle that we can take.  And so then it became about just reshaping what they already had to lead with PR and then use a full service marketing to support it.  And so then that became a thing of like, don't just generate buzz, capture it. So we have the PR as a big activation and then we have the full service marketing to funnel the attention.  and that we generate down the file towards customers. And so they pivoted to this. And within 12 months, they were doing over million in revenue.  So it worked out very well. then I won't take full credit for that, but it helped. And then one more.  This is a sales company actually that I worked with. Very clever, guys. They figured out how to make the GPS in your phone 100 times more accurate to the point where you can like stand in a door frame and you have your phone here and then you pass it to your other hand and it'll be like, you're outside, you're inside, you're outside, you're inside, like pinpoint accurate.  so they figured out like, OK, well, delivery companies could really benefit from this. But they were leading with this messaging of like, make deliveries more accurate always.  It kind of makes sense if you know what the product is but doesn't if you don't. And it was really about a process of going through like, well, what is the key capability?  Like, what's like the big show stuff in here? And it was really about the fact that it shows delivery drivers where they should park and where the door is, which cut out so much bedtime and Uber driving getting lost or whatever.  And so I'm like, cool, let's make up the headline. Not sure it's delivery drivers where the park and where the door is.  like, so not persuasive, dumb, simple, and real meat and potatoes copywriting. But the conversion rates went up by 500% within three weeks of books demos just from changing the words on the website, which is cool.  And so here is how this is all pulled together. So this is like the model. So what we want to do is work very collaboratively, because we can't do this in isolation, getting a freelancer to write your brand messaging for you is like getting a stranger to write your dating.  profile. It just doesn't work. What we'll do is like build it out and develop it collaboratively. so what we want to first do is understand the buyer intent.  What we don't care about is like how old they are, how many kids they have, if they drive to work take the bus, all we care about is what are they trying to achieve and what's stopping them from achieving those things.  And we want to unpack their awareness level. What do they now know today and what do they need to know in order to see the value and what it is you do.  And like what's the value problem? Let's get the key points down. Then we want to think about positioning, which is really about understanding what category you're in or more importantly, what kind of gory do your buyers think that you're in?  What are they comparing you to? Because once we know what they're comparing you to, then we know what we need to be juxtaposed against.  We also unpack your true differentiation. The stuff that you do that is truly, truly different that they cannot get elsewhere.  And then we want to start to rank that like what is most important to your buyers and what it's important to your buyers.  That will start to give us a sense of what we should easily do. Then we want to fold that into your anything messaging.  And so that is your one liner, that is your elevated hitch, and that is your larger persuasive argument. I'm very actually anti-storytelling in marketing, and I that it's very overblown, like we're not, especially in B2B, like we're not around a campfire, we're more like a lawyer in a courtroom, making a case to a very skeptical jury, and so we want to get very, very precise and very, very deliberate with our word choice and how we convey our value.  And so these three workshops allow us to build out your messaging strategy. And then that gives us ammunition to apply to like the highest impact asset, like what is like the most pressing touch point, most critical touch point in your funnel that needs an uplift with this new messaging.  And so maybe it is your homepage, and so we go, right, let's fold this into your homepage, get the homepage structured down, build out the wire, information hierarchy, we'll capture the messaging, and then together we'll take that  messaging and we'll turn it into copywriting. So that by the time you get to the end of this process, you don't just have your full like range messaging.  You also have like an asset that you can literally like, you know, take those words and then upload that same page as I do once in your colors and new images and it's ready to go.  And then we, you know, your new messaging kind of becomes a communication foundation for your whole business. And then we can fold it out until like, okay, well, what is like the next highest impact asset that is worth developing?  And so maybe we've done the homepage. Maybe it's a sales day because that needs to align once they convert on the homepage.  And so then let's go through that. And then we want to drive people to the homepage. So we need a whole leadership strategy.  want to capture the people who aren't ready to convert us. We need a lead back there. We need an email nurture sequence for the people who download the lead back there.  And we can essentially go one by one and just be applying the new messaging strategy to each critical touchpoint in the funnel.  So that by the end, you don't just have a funnel, like, it's all optimized. every touchpoint is singing the same song and you have an always on marketing mission.  And so these are the questions that I normally get at the stage but are there any of the two of you ahead?  That's my selfish.

22:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very good, very clear. Let me think about that. So one of things that I really liked was how you made it look that there's like this initial tree workshop thing and then it's very natural to get more stuff from you and just contribute to something.  There's like a vision of what you're building towards. I think that was really elegantly made because it doesn't come across as you trying to sell  Tell me more stuff. It's just like, oh, I want these things to be coherent, and cohesive, and if I hire some dude that will use chat GPT to do the messaging, I'm throwing money away.  So that's really good. I'm making mental notes for myself. And one of the things, so questions about the pitch.  I do have a question about that interaction, the Apple thing, you've mentioned that a lot of people don't really get it.  Why do you have it there? I'm not saying you shouldn't have, but I just want to understand more. Why do you have it there?  It's a really good question.

23:39 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  think it's kind of a, my thinking was, and I don't know if this is sound, but this is my thinking, my theory, was like, all right, this is like,  like a very low impact, like they do get it, but they just sometimes struggle to get to the right answer.  And I don't, when they, when they don't get it right, I'm like, oh, you know, yeah, it's actually more like this, right?  But my thinking is like, it allows for a bit of a breather, so that I'm not just talking the whole time, and the moment of interaction there.  It also should give them like a little bit of a taste of like the collaborative nature of the engagement as a whole, like just a little.  Okay, okay, okay, and they should, and a lot of them haven't, it's kind of weird, like, if you're in a marketing bubble for any amount of time, like the 1000 songs in your pocket, you've seen it a million times.  We have a lot of people haven't seen it. I'm always like, do know what they ended up going with?  And like, and 70% of people like that, but no idea. So the other thing is like they learn something new, they kind of see the world in a slightly different way.  Oh, I see why that message, I don't, I'm not just pointing out being like, this is a good message.  I'm like, here are the components of why it is a good message. And then when I, and then that allows me to pivot too.  So what we're trying to do is find what is your 1000 songs in your pocket. And that's like a bit of like a moment of like, I want that like it's a bit of inspiration.  And then I can bring it into the case studies of showing how I did it for other people than through the process.  That's not thinking behind it, but like it feels like I don't know that maybe bit of a drag to it or I don't know what you thought.

25:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no. I think the thinking is really good. It makes a lot of sense. It's interesting to see the meta game.  I was just wondering if at times, but maybe this is not a big issue because you've done this a lot of times people get stuck and it becomes little bit a lull in the conversation.  But I think the benefits of what you tell me, they seem to be. be worth like the occasional like a bit more squarish or stuck up person that cannot participate.  So yeah, I mean, it seems it smart, especially the hint at a collaborative nature. I think it's really clever.  And it creates a they take something home, right? If they get it, they know you get it. If they don't get it, they are like, oh, this guy gets it.  And now I'm for nothing new, right? There's no way of it going wrong. So in terms of like the experience, the end result of it, I think is 100% positive.  I was just thinking like, could it be that sometimes this, know, because for instance, when I'm listening, I think I have a bit of a beach resting face, a rest resting beach face.

26:53 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I don't know.

26:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I come across as a bit more serious. And maybe for you that were telling me this stuff.  I don't know, if it felt like I was overly judging or something, I don't know if this happens with other people.

27:10 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I didn't get that vibe from you.

27:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, okay, cool. I'll just find another condition to have, I need to have something. Well, I really like the fact that it was, you walk the talk because you begin by talking about perspective, right?  And this is something that has popped up in my radar more in the past few times and I think it makes a lot of sense.  And you start with that and you clearly have that, sorry, my cat is a bit annoying. Anyway, you clearly have that.  So I like the structure of your service. I like the presentation. I have my, those questions about the interaction moment.  And now I'm thinking about that toe-dipping thing because you already have these workshops, Every experiment, we're just slicing one off of them and just saying this is like really cheaper but gets them excited for the next thing.

28:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, let's talk about it. I think that might be the way, I think that might be the way, let me share my screen for a second again, sort of same thing.  What I find is that the end of the workshop, it's like you know, like it's a good session and it's a good like it's kind of a it's like a lower impact thing, like I'm not demanding.  doing too much of them in that first in that first session was kind of getting uh getting our teeth a lot of people say um it's a it's this session that this is where the our moments happen this is where people's minds get  blown oh my god of course no wonder this is how we should have been no wonder we've struggled with this like once we get this stuff in game changer and then they're really sold in so the first one's like you know that they're cool at the end they're like okay yeah these are session are right still a bit of like a I'm trusting the process kind of feeling and then at the end of this one they're like oh I don't trust the process I am devoted to the process um I would give my first one child to the process it happens a lot so yeah so it's kind of you know the big the big fireworks moment it's in workshop too
  ACTION ITEM: Develop toe-dipping workshop as potential one-off offering - focus on moving needle on one problem in 1-2 hrs - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QPysGK-L3RYEdU9nsR1oXL3GUe_GpmZA?timestamp=1784.9999  kind of need workshop one to happen first in order to get there and so I don't know how to slice it off because then if I just sell a workshop one it could just be a bit of a damp kind of thing.  I see it. It's a bit like modern movies and trailers, right?

30:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  put everything in the trailer, don't need to watch the movie.

30:20 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. So now that's a very interesting not to crack.

30:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So clearly there's two approaches we would need to figure out which is either we find some way of bringing positioning earlier without needing the bio intent.  I think that's probably like the brute force kind of thing or we can shift something about that inside that happens in the second workshop into the first one.

31:01 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  you said the first one like they get it and it's kind of is not a shock is a gradual thing like oh yeah it makes sense it makes sense it all made sense right and the second one is like oh  I was doing something wrong yeah yeah there's a couple of truth grenades in the first one and then I mean my other thought is that what I've learned is that like people don't actually know what the  they're selling mm-hmm they don't have an offer they have services yeah like wondering why nobody's buying their service or like they have to cut prices or I have to compete or pitch or whatever I go to some selling the same thing as everybody else what you need is an offer and what I end up doing  It's actually building out like Building out that offer like in order to position. Well, you need to have a Market and you need to have a product to sell to that market.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's true Like these businesses that are like Doing millions in revenue like the they're they're still living in like a lower competition world and the world is And so what I actually help them do is is is And like builds like what is your what is your foot in the door offer?  them and then Kick a sub segment that would benefit most from that and so my latest thoughts is like you know what a lot of this stuff Assumes that they already have the defined products and they don't it's kind of in the gaps of these exercises that I'm like You  Forcing them to like build out like we need an offer for you know to be talked to me to be making his exercises work But I'm thinking like I need Potentially a workshop around like let's develop your offer before we even develop the brand Or it's like the shadow brief, right?

33:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They don't hire you for it, but you need to do it to get the results you need I've haven't even heard that time before but exactly yes Yeah, so I And in your experience when you talk about offers How do they take it?  How do they think about it?

33:57 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Especially 2024, when I'm like, well, what we need is a foot in the door offer conversation. And they go, yes, yeah, actually, no, we do need that.  That's what we've been missing. Like it used to be a thing that I'd have to educate them more around of like why it's why good.  And now it's like automatically like, yeah, no, that is, you're right, we do need that. They haven't arrived at that thought independently.  But once I give them a little prompt, they click in. But it feels like it's tricky because like, I don't think in my marketing, I don't think me being like, I will build your offer for you is like a good marketing message.  People don't know that they want it in the marketing. I think like people know that they need that they have a messaging problem.  They don't know that they have an offer problem until.

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  until we're like in the in the work yeah yeah yeah I think I can definitely see it also marketing is so much it's quite a big thing and I think people usually get this more surface level about comms and you know promotion and stuff like that and there's just way more than that right so I don't think I don't think we'll come up with like a solution for this because you've been you know enabling on this for a while not in this call for sure but so there's this tension I think okay what's this so there's this tension between the moment of the stronger the strongest moment of insight which happens on the second stage and  having a very strong start, so a good food-in-the-dog kind of thing, right, because the strongest moment happens big because you have this introduction, like the idea of being through the first one, and now they are, you know, primed, and then they get there, right?  there's a tension here that we don't know yet the up to solve, and there's an aspect around offer creation, because it is what they need, but it's not what they call you for, right?

36:38 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, they don't know that they need it, and if I started talking about it, they'd be like, yeah, that's what other people...  Yeah, it's only when we start going through these exercises, and they're like struggling to answer the questions, and they can be like, essentially,  Oh, by the Use yeah, if there was like a defined thing that we could be telling. Yeah, well, then let's like think about what that could be.  And then we can start to do it some shape. I am also thinking, though, my statement about like, we need to have the first workshop first to make the second workshop work.
  ACTION ITEM: Experiment with swapping order of workshops - positioning first, then buyer intent - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QPysGK-L3RYEdU9nsR1oXL3GUe_GpmZA?timestamp=2236.9999  I don't know if that's true. I haven't seen that. You might not be true, yeah.

37:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if that's true at all.

37:32 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I'm sorry.

37:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Come on.

37:35 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  The second workshop, dive into like, yeah, first workshop, we're kind of talking about the buyer. are they trying to achieve?  What's talking about the thing? What do they not know? What's the education gap? Et cetera, et cetera. The second workshop is when we dive into like the actual products that they're selling.  We list out like what are the differentiating features? And these are the... Attraction features not the consideration. They always try and be like all but very good at customer service So we've got great experience like right.  That's beneficial after they've already purchased you need to think about the stuff before they And then that's when they that's when things are like I think honestly like I could probably swap those around I might even test that for my next and it's engagement and see what happens Because I think it could be fine Probably probably you probably can cuz I Suppose that one of the reasons that people get excited at the second one.

38:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's it's more about them So Yeah, getting them to talk about themselves in the first one. I think you probably you know Be very energizing And you can always go back to it and you can even use this as kind of a moment of truth Which is like we start like looking at  inside and I make all these things. don't know where you do it. Anyway, you go back all this information and then at the end or at the beginning of the next one, before you start talking about binary intents, you let them know that we needed to create a draft of a model of reality, right?  We need to start with assumptions and everything we've used that relates to how people perceive us was an assumption and now we will turn these assumptions into certainty, right?  So it was useful for them to do the work and they won't think that you are tricking them. was necessary for them to do the work and then they felt hurt, which is like the big thing, right?  And then you're like, okay, so now we're going to make sure it even makes it come across as a bit more rigorous, right?  We're going to make sure that we're not just pulling this out of our assets. We're going to turn these assumptions into certainties.  I found that these levels of certainty kind of thinking. people kind of get it if it's not too granular and it helps moving the ball forward.  But if you start by saying that it gets confusing because most people don't think in these terms. But if you say what we did was this and now we're going to like drill down and get really sure about it.  think people get it.

40:19 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah. I like that angle. like that approach. And then, yeah, I do swap them around and I could even do positioning as a stand-alone thing.  But then they need, what would the offer development be? That's the thing, like the offer development often comes from the positioning, the workshop is making a workshop, which is why it's also such an aha moment for them.  It's like aha, we now know something to lead with. Right. Great. The big before and after. And then we call that to go ahead for messaging.  Yeah. We might have solved it. It was fast.

41:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nobody just, just talking through, through stuff works and it's magical. Yeah. Yeah.

41:28 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  You're just working on your, it's just you at the moment, right? Yeah. Is that the plan to keep it that way?  I think so.

41:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I do like to work with other people on projects and stuff. I think that's one of but I really don't want to hire or like get partners and stuff like that.  Yeah. You are also Soluing right now. I'm trying to avoid hiring or as long as possible I think I think these days like you don't need to hire Yeah, I'm I gonna be a at some point So yeah, that's kind of my the limit of how I would move into that At least right now just yesterday Have you heard of David C Baker?  Yes, I like his stuff and Yesterday Chris though was sharing a video where it talks about that David C.  Baker's like the formula for confidence Which I mean it sounds tacky, but I think it was it made a lot of sense Because I said, you know confidence is related to how much opportunity you have and how much capacity you have so if you increase your capacity and And the opportunity doesn't follow then you'll feel less confident you'll want to close on things that you wouldn't actually  So the easiest way of increasing your company is just keep your capacity low, right?

43:05 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Mm-hmm.

43:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was like, yeah, that seems to make sense. I would like to try it out better.

43:11 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, and this is like why the old school method is like I'm gonna hire people and then try and sell their hours to the market You're just constantly trying to fill the leaky capacity bucket time.  Just creates capacity always And then you just have like five people to worry about and sort of one.

43:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, that must be hell Yeah, I don't know my my daddy has a as a metal working thing company and Like every month they they got it and there was a time you he didn't have his own but he was responsible for it And he told him like every month we have to make this amount of money and I was like .  How can you sleep? And he couldn't sleep. That's the point, right?

43:58 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Right, right But you got good at sales.

44:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you got good at sales. Yeah, that's it. So, OK, I think the idea of experimenting, bringing the position first makes a lot of sense.  In terms of the offer building, maybe, I don't know if this is crazy, but maybe there's something here in terms of as you move through the other stuff.  At some point, you have a new slide that shows like a side quest. Even visually, it looks like this is not like the main thing, but I think it makes sense to you.  And it could feel like both structured and special.

44:40 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Maybe that there's something there, I don't know. I'm unsure.

44:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I like that, I like that.

44:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  People don't know what the word offer means.

44:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I mean, I got to be honest, I'm also learning it as we go. Yeah, I I don't even know if I know what it means.

45:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  But like... But yeah, yeah, it's certainly not a thing that people self-diagnosed with, it's like, are we even off, but no, it's like, amarting, it's bad, and we don't know what to say.  It's kind of a bit of a Trojan horse, kind of, strategy to bring it on the promise of like brand messaging, but actually what I'm giving them is like, when I'm giving them an offer, what I'm giving them is like, it's sort of like, it's like a business strategy.  It's so wild.

45:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the business strategy for them.

45:36 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Here is what you sell in here is who you sell it to, that's strategy. And it's also kind of it's got to go to market kind of strategy with them up as well.  It's wild. They trust me to do that, but at least they have something, and they seem happy at the end, but it's sometimes a lot of time actually.  But yeah, so I think what I'm actually trying to get to even further, all of those, here are all the deliverables that we can apply your messaging to, all leadership strategy, sales, etc.  You can actually get away from anything implementation, just be a messaging strategy guy. I'm still figuring out how to do that exactly.  I think that basically needs like an army of freelancers and contractors to do the thing. And that sounds like a whole different job in and of itself.  But the more I'm like away from like being on the tools and more like in the strategic boardroom, the higher leverage I have, and the more I can charge.  And I just sold, it's crazy. just sold this, I used to charge for like the brand messaging and the homepage full structure.  writing, that was 5k, up until like a few months ago, so low, for so long, it's wild. And I just sold these first three workshops, just to then nothing else, the 10k, and their own, just the messaging strategy.  I'm like, that's, that's interesting, that people are paying just for that. So I need to like figure out how to expand that somehow as well.  think offer development kind of into it.

47:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and there's this aspect of, you need the repetitions to find them once, and it is the new ones that, you know, you know, you get the leverage points.  Yeah, I also have a thing about around charging, and that's, that's something I need to figure out much better.  But anyway, you know, the way you spoke, mean, you are in the messaging space, clearly, know about flash PMN.  Have you noticed what they've done with, like, trusted suppliers or vendors?

48:09 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  All I know is that they, I've had, I spoke to Robert, I had a really good call with him.  They actually, so I used to get a tiny bit of context and then I'll answer your question. I used to work with both B2D SaaS and B2D services.  And the way that they, , like, it is their product, their offer to B2D SaaS. I was like, I cannot beat them.  That is so perfect. That is so  good. And I don't even want to be competing with them because I'll only ever be able to get a second place at best.  Like that, won.

48:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They won.

48:50 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And it literally, like, it was the best thing because it forced me to be like, all right, I'm not doing this else anymore, just services.  And that was so freeing. was like a weight of my shelter. And now I can be like the guy who's like the fleshed, but you know, and I spoke to Robert and I told, I like admitted this, the reason I don't choose us anymore.

49:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He was like, it's a big world dude.

49:17 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What are you talking about? Like, no, You're already gone. I'm out. I don't want to compete with you. So to answer your question, I know that they've got like some very like on-call people.  Who are basically like, they're not quite employees, but they are just available for all their projects all the time.  Is that right?

49:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think they have that, but they also have something that the clients can see. Like, if you go now on their website, they have the new section.

49:43 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That doesn't have a lot of people yet.

49:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That I think is like implementation part. Didn't go like that.

49:49 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  They've got a directory?

49:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Process partners. Yeah. Yeah.

49:57 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Okay. Yeah. Look at.

50:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, these trusted partners they talk about, are not just no copy guys or they're not exactly implementation people, I think, but there's a way of thinking around this that I think it could connect with what you're doing, like you're not responsible for them, but you have kind of vetted them and you have some sort of conditions around that, I don't know.

50:24 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Do you know any actually on that, do you know any like good web designers?

50:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to say no, I mean, I know web designers, but I don't think it's anything. I've been trying to do my own thing, just shamelessly copying Fletcher's structure.  It's like it's insane how much it is a copy of their structure, but I'm like,  it, because I come to a design that's usually where I get, I spend too much time and I'm like, I don't care.

51:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I'll just.

51:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So no, I don't, like I have a WordPress guy that helps me fix stuff, but it's not like a designer conversion sort of thing.

51:11 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  have just, that's interesting. On their homepage, they've updated the headline. It used to be let's fix your confusing homepage, and now it's let's fix your confusing positioning.  Going up this thing.

51:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also, they've increased their price. It used to be $7.50, now it's $10k.

51:37 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, It used to $5, actually. Are you a met him at $5? Yeah, yeah. I was like, that's like, this is what pissed me off so much.  I'm like, they have like, it was so weird coming across and being like, oh my God, they had the same process that I do.  They charge exactly the same amount that I do. And there's so much better of mine. that made me so sad, but not competing with them anymore was like the best choice of my life.

52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, I apologize. No, no, go on. No, I totally get that feeling because I've had that with different people that like, oh man, this guy's doing exactly what I wanted to be doing, but he's like 10 years ahead of me, I'm .  And then eventually I started messaging these guys and all of them turned out to be like, great guys. And I even got like, work from some of them, because I mean, if people see the world the way you see it, there's probably like a lot of shared things.  So in the end, it was good. But my first reaction was a sinking feeling like, I'm doomed. These things are doing the thing I want to do and they're already good at it.

52:50 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah, And also, you can take something and to the fact that there are people looking at you who are thinking the exact same thing.  Yeah, I...

53:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That has started to happen like a little bit, but like just the tiny wave of it and it's so strange.  So we're like really?

53:10 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I think speaking of who would be, who would be like a good kid for your services?

53:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In terms of a client?

53:23 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah. Like can I work for people too? You can.

53:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So thank you for asking that. Not going to pretend I have this lockdown, but basically I think it's professional services firms that they have this, it's a bit like people like you I think, they have this thing, they have this way of doing things, but they struggle to show it before they do it.  And I think advisory firms. is more in line with it. For instance, like lawyers, I don't think is a good one, mostly because people kind of have a mental model of what a lawyer is or an accountant is, so I don't think it fits.  It's more like niche expertise that people always struggle to explain. I think that's where I can be the most helpful.

54:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, things like creativity involved, I would imagine.

54:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, but a lot of these people, I don't think they see themselves as creatives. mean, if you say you're creative because you're an expert, you connect.  I am, but creative people think about designers with those bags, right?

54:39 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, no, no. I mean, I've been thinking of like software development firms, who are like, you know, they could be running workshops with their clients, be like, let's build an app together kind of thing, let's figure out what it takes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for instance, a client I'm not looking for is like innovation companies, because they know all the motions, and I think they become a bit resistant to the things I'm telling them, but then they don't do it because they're like, oh, I'm going to do it inside, but then there's something lacking.  Anyway, I don't think it's a good fit. Software development is good because it's a bit crazy, but oftentimes the struggles they have come from that lack of clarity that complex projects always have at the beginning and they need to manage these things.  Just having a briefing workshop for a lot of software companies would be just really useful. So software companies, then things that are a little I think that would make sense.

55:58 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, yeah. I'll take a lot of marketing agencies as well that kind of in that same mode of like, there's no leverage in being like the implementation people anymore in opposed to AI world and the web vision for everything that works.  They kind of have to move up chains who have to move up the ladder in order to just like save floats to like keep existing.  And that's kind of a whole new skill set that they need to line. I would imagine they'd be pretty well placed to teach on that.

56:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That makes, I love that phrase. Yeah, because I have the same perspective on AI, it's either you go turbo cheap and I don't think anyone in the developed world can do that.  And, or you create like this experience. So I'm just Let me give you an example. It's bit of aspirational for me right now.  There's this company, they called Meza, M-E-S-E-A, Meza. It means stable, right, in Portuguese, Spanish. And what they do is like, they have one workshop format, but they do it like in the middle of a jungle in Costa Rica, and they call, they invite like experts from all over the world.  They've done this with Kobe Bryant, OK, like, this is the sort of thing. And people come to them and say, oh, we have this challenge, we want to solve, we want to have disaster, resilient housing for cheap and vegan, sub-Saharan Africa, I don't know.  And then there's like this foundation that hires them. then they say, oh, we found this expert from Vietnam, that's really good.  So they put together like these adventures of that specific problem. They put them one week for a week in one specific place.  That's very cool. They just made the whole workshop very elevated the whole thing. And I think each workshop of them costs at least hundreds of thousands, probably into the millions sometimes.  And it's like, okay, they really have moved the whole workshop problem solving approach of markets.

58:20 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  It's really clever.

58:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not a circle of cooperation out of the run because it involves more people, but this way of things like people solving problems is not about techniques anymore, or it's not just about that.  Because also, if you pay a million for a workshop, I mean, there's a whole thing you've told me about price, right?  It feels different. take it in a different way. And I think they mix high-level hospitality with problem solving. I think that's the thing.

58:51 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  it's really interesting.

58:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

58:57 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  That is super interesting. That is super interesting.

59:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you the link and there's there's a post that talks about their method.

59:07 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  What aspects of it would you do you think I'm like most applicable to? Do you want to be doing?  To you or to me?

59:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To me? I think I think it's kind of the end-to-end experience that I want to really nail down and for right now one of my challenges is if we just sit with a mirror and post it I'm very confident that it will be useful for you.  The moment I start over designing the experience then you start to feel the kinks it still works but at least the person says like oh he didn't use this framework that he had here like I got value but we went off track now it becomes legible that I was kind of moving with the thing and maybe these are  personal hiccup of mind but I get the sense that people don't always see adaptability as a sign of as a good thing and maybe they see it as just improvising right but at the same time I really struggle with like oh I've planned for this it stopped making sense because you just told me that you're going to be acquired in three months but I'll just follow this structure I cannot do that I feel very weird about it so I think for me the tension is create an experience that is that feels very seamless and like there's very tactical things about this like the sort of email get to prepare like the pack of references this sort of thing I think it really elevates experience and then there's like these internal changes you need to go through like for instance I think the way I communicate now is still very much closer to the implementation side than the strategy side  So, I mean, there's different things going on, but eventually, yeah, I want to be a cool company that people are like, oh, we're so happy that we're going to do this thing, we're excited to do this workshop, you know, which you give me that feeling from your presentation, so I think that's a good thing.

1:01:21 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, I think on the kind of, you know, going off track when, like, what you have planned is no longer relevant based on information that you land, because I do that sometimes.  And what I've just learned to do is be like, oh, all right, here is what I was going to do, but based on what you told me, that's no longer relevant, here is what we're going to be doing instead, and then they're like, that's very good, that's very good, it's like overcommunicate everything.  Oh, I'm writing that now, I feel so sealed, I mean. I think there's something that you have here that could be productized I think potentially more more cleanly and it's less about the yeah it kind of comes back to this like two different kind of like making that like this like your toe dipper is building their toe dipper kind of thing yes sorry I'm interrupting you I mean yeah I'm here for me I mean that's really like I think like you can build a whole thing  out of that of like, because then that has implications on like, what they go to markets for other tools, what they're messaging is, what everything is, it's that kind of, yeah, that initial product development to get people in the door.  And anything, this is what I've learned, anything that is closer to the transaction immediately becomes perceived as a very more valuable foot.  And so if you can bring anything closer to the point of sale, they'll pay more for it and they'll value it more, even if it's less objectively valuable.

1:03:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's really like the thing I've been working through this week and a little bit of the past one, because I was under the impression that my taste of products was building your taste of products, but building your taste.  a taste of product is in itself more complex than what would fit inside of a taste of product. So it's like, it's like inception, you need to go deeper.  And what the hypothesis I have right now is my taste of product is around a taste of product, but it's not a design of a taste of product.  It's maybe something around opportunities for your taste I've, it's so funny to follow the market because I thought people wanted workshops and then I started talking about, you know, these things and start to realize what people want is the toe dipping.  There's like this, I also like the idea of like, go to market for expertise. There's something there. But I think it depends on what's their culture where they come from, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Update website to include both toe-dipping workshop and full workshop package offerings - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QPysGK-L3RYEdU9nsR1oXL3GUe_GpmZA?timestamp=3889.9999  this doesn't mean anything to them. And yeah, I agree with you. I agree is the toe is a toe dipping thing.  That's the most. Relevant thing and right now on my website. I was like following like oh flash those like this And then eventually I got to the to the last point and my my challenge is this so at the last point I could have build your toe-deeping workshop it costs 2000 and But that's not a toe-deeping thing I should have a toe-deeping thing, right?  So I mean at least I think I need at least two things. I think I'm always a toe-deeping and The toe-deeping making thing, right?  And I'm like what's my toe-deeping? Anyway, we've said to like a lot of times.

1:05:41 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I think I think it is possible to combine that. I do think it is possible Come see you what come see your mind Well if we think about like what does I mean what's cool about it is that whether they are currently running workshops or not  But they could still get something that they still want. I literally run workshops, and I still need a toe-dipping workshop.  And for some reason, that could be the first call rate into this world, and it feels less scary in this interview.  So it applies to both markets, which is cool. If you think about what does a toe-dipping product needs to be, I mean, really, what you can help me develop is a just like a killer lead, that people pay for.  And so it's going like what's like one problem that you can move the needle on, that you can help your clients move the needle on in one hour or two hours or whatever, how long it needs to be.  Like, that's kind of the direction that I'd be taking. Or like, how to build your toe-dipping. thing, and then your two dipping thing is teaching how to build their two dipping thing, but it's the same thing as like moving the needle on one milestone.
  ACTION ITEM: Research lead magnet best practices to inform toe-dipping workshop development - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QPysGK-L3RYEdU9nsR1oXL3GUe_GpmZA?timestamp=4021.9999  I think about it like a lead magnet, and I'd look into like one makes a good lead magnet because I think the same logic applies actually.

1:07:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's very good. Yeah, because I, yeah, that just makes sort of sense. And it's so interesting, like anything you can pick, you can choose if you spend enough time thinking about it becomes interesting again, right?  Because I go, I'm going to be a specialist about about fiberboards, like, isn't some time on it, it becomes fascinating.

  Totally, totally. I was thinking about doors the other day. I was like, they're actually an engineering marvel, doors. Yeah, but what was wrong with the door?  Yes, and so like, then you can have it, and then like that leads into, I guess you could call it like, like your, I would be framing it as like, you've got your toe dipping workshop development, that is your Twitter that helps them develop their Twitter, and then you would want like, and then the big two package is like your flagship product, and I'd be giving it that label flagship.  Yeah, I use the word flagship, I really like it.

1:08:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, all of it and using it, right.

1:08:34 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Cool. So yeah, sorry about that.

1:08:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I just think that I need to sit with this little while, for a little while, it's very reassuring to see your perspective on this is not completely different.
  ACTION ITEM: Refine toe-dipping workshop concept - balance between short process and high value delivery - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QPysGK-L3RYEdU9nsR1oXL3GUe_GpmZA?timestamp=4119.9999  My biggest thing about the toe dipping is like, to make it really work, it is not a quick thing.  So. How can I, there's something there and the lead magnet angle is very good. How can I make it my own short process that gets them a lot of value and then there's also some of the things we can do like, you can do like these live sessions that you record, you doing it for somebody and then you can just use that as content.  Although I don't think it has the same impact, but anyway.

1:09:26 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, you can have like a group session and like, you can take it $400 a pop to the ring kind of thing.  That's the first one I see back there, everyone. Well, you know, do it one on one for several thousand dollars.  Like, those are, yeah, there's a lot of ways you can roll it out. Yeah, I think it's just kind of like doing the one on one thing.  So, getting the reps in, ironing out the case. And then having something to pop some of them towards what you already do.  Yeah, that feels like a good, it feels like It's a good put in the door thing, and then that's something that you can leave with and all of your mouth in.  Here's why you need a toe-dip workshop. Everyone needs a toe-dip workshop. If you're a service business without a toe-dip workshop right now, you are falling behind.  Everyone else is doing it.

1:10:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's my perspective. Exactly.

1:10:17 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Yeah, right.

1:10:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've made a list of customer pain points that I've collected from conversations. It's so much easier to connect them with toe-dipping workshops than just workshops, because the ones that I got the most of is like people don't know what I do, people don't know what to buy from me.  I don't know exactly what I do, people only get it when they see it, this type of thing. The toe-dipping connects perfectly with it.

1:10:48 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  How's exactly. They already get it as soon as you say it. You get be to take it to a workshop to get yourself to your clients before they trust you for the big spectacular package that you're going to sell to them after.  And then you can even frame it up. It's like anything. And the third tip of workshop is they're paying you to sell to them, and you're like, there's loops in their brain for like what they need to do to like actually take it further and get the full value out of your approach.  And that makes sense. Yeah, dude, I think you're on the side. Thank you.

1:11:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. That's great to hear. I really enjoy your conversations. So I hope, I mean, this is great for me that you got me a lot of ideas, got a lot of feedback.  I hope I was helpful as well. By the way, have you heard of this book? You might like it.

1:11:42 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I trusted advisor. Yeah. When did I start reading that? I started reading. Probably three years ago. Probably three years ago.  I finished reading. That's the question. Why do you mind?

1:11:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so pristine.

1:12:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I don't remember single, I remember having live old moments as I was reading it, but I also don't remember anything, you know.

1:12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I totally get the feeling, because you know what I'm saying this, because I guess they're sucking some dude, I wanted to come across a smile, oh, there's a book, and then I was like looking for something to send him like a picture of the page, not just a book, and I'm like, , this is good, I need to read this, and then I left it on my table, like, I mean, there's a lot of stuff I need to read.  And because of that, it was here, and it made me think of it.

1:12:31 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  Because you provided me, I need to go back into it. What was good, I have no idea anything that was You trust that it is good, but you don't know for sure, yeah.  Yeah, I read it. Did I listen to it? Was it an audio book? I don't know. You know what the, do you have, like, one book that, like, your, how do you see the world?

1:12:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  On a personal note, I think it was guns, germs, and steel. because it got me into the whole big history thing I like big history and I think yeah I anti-fragile was big for me in our world I think the business of expertise what about you yeah I I've never been the same I've never been the same I don't know yet none it was so I was like oh this is how the world works oh god no wonder like I was always like sorry about it like office politics I was like I didn't even I was I mean I kind of was like I think I'm out of that I don't need to participate like me yeah like it or not if you're in the office you are

1:14:00 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  But like kind of, yeah, it was so I've been just seeing like here at the levels that people pull to gain power and power is not real, right?  It's only exists because enough people agree that it exists, so like it's about controlling perception. It's perception management, it's all appearances, it's all smoke and mirrors.  And so like there's a lot that goes into like a successful expert that also, like the... Like, yeah, yeah, So that one was really eye-opening.  For me, unlike the descensible, it was actually bacon. it was even without pitching. That also was a before and after moment for me.  I was like, kind of early on in my solo career. and I had like the biggest deal that I had at the time which was like $15,000 for like a whole bunch of  to the footballs. But I was like, I can't believe somebody wants to give me all this money in one go.  And it would have been like hell, it would have taken months. But I really wanted to do it. And then I read that book, and I like, I'm not going to do it.  It's like, it was a B2C company, was like an e-commerce company, and I was still doing kind of, I'll do everything.  I'll do whatever people want me to do, kind of thing. And I was like, that book, reading through that book, it was like, keep the lane, I can stick to that lane, and do not waver.  And I was like, I don't like doing e-commerce. like B2P, and I'm going to pick that lane, and it's like to it.  And then having that opportunity to be like, no, two or fifteen thousand. Oh, that doesn't.

1:15:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  me in the cage.

1:15:47 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  put me in the lane, and it was like, so confirming. it just made life easier as well. More now you go, the fewer options you have, and life becomes easy.  People think it's way harder to go, and error is easier. And then I read the business of expertise after that, but I think like a lot of the revelations that I had in, when without pitching, we're kind of reinforcing business of expertise.

1:16:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If I read them in different orders, it would be different, but like, I read that one second so it was something back for me, but like, a lot of people decided it was a big book for them, and I'm like, I do that, that, I do that, that, yeah, Because that world, and I went back into solo, and in a way, I think it was all an issue of confidence, it turned out okay, it was good for me that interruption, but it also sliced my personal journey into the solo thing, because I read the winning without pitching before that interruption, and I've read the business of expertise afterwards, so it's, I probably had similar revelations, but I didn't have enough repetitions to put them in.  place and I just got a job and forgot like 70% of all of that thing. But to forgate laws of power.  I mean this has been popping up more in my YouTube. I really watch a lot of YouTube and I always thought it was like just you know picking up girls sort of thing.  But since they have like the 50 cent edition, the 50 words of power, what's that one you read?

1:17:25 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  You know what, think I did read it afterwards and I was like why am I reading this? This is so boring.  No like it's all like it's like all the examples are like like French kings and like I like make it in the court of King Louis the 14th and not even King Louis the 14th like the noblemen around him.  Like what how of games did they play? Because the king doesn't to do the king.

1:17:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That everyone has to be very careful of chess moves all the time.

1:17:55 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  And so like oh my god getting in like deep insight into how they did it in like such a cut for environment.  I mean, now, like, the office politics are, like, child's playing on the floor. I got to read that.

1:18:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm fascinated by that. Because I'm on outside, they're looking in. mean, that doesn't come naturally to me. And I just think it's cool, but I need to read it.  Yeah.

1:18:18 - Alex James (Meaningful Marketing)
  I apologize in advance. There was a darkness to the book. will admit that there's a cynicism to it of, like, the world is kind of  and everyone in it is .  But it would just be, it would give you, like, a self-defense mechanism against, like, people all thing weird. That's the best way to know.  I didn't know what to look for. That's, that's really good.
