0:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm so glad to be with you, man. I'm so glad to be with you.

0:05 - Nate Jebb
  Let me, uh, let me figure this out real quick. No problem. Turn my camera on, uh, actually, I'm going to, I'm going to get logged on on my computer.  I'm going to leave. I'll be right back. Okay.

0:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:52 - Nate Jebb
  Okay, we did it. We did it. Oh my goodness. I'm excited to be here. Oh, you even put on a jacket.

2:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You were you didn't have a jacket on so I know well, it's funny.

2:07 - Nate Jebb
  It's psychological for me. I Grew I grew up wearing suits like my grandma told me like wear a suit, you know And so if I put on a suit coat or something, I feel like I think differently.  I think better I think That makes a lot of sense to me.

2:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been wondering about that.

2:28 - Nate Jebb
  So I'm not being cheeky about it Yeah, no, it's a sign to myself that I take this time with you very seriously, I'm gonna do right by you now I still my challenges I Sometimes get too serious like you got to stay playful, you know All right, um, okay, so let me just  All right, here's what I want to do. Thanks for humoring me. I want to do a little bit of a teaching.  I know I said make a find that workable list. We need to do that. We will do it. It just won't take a lot of time.  But I want to teach you what I know. And then that's what we'll do. OK. That's We have three goals for this time.  I'm going to teach you. The first goal is to teach you persuasive question asking, which is a format. know you're actually a great question ask her.  persuasive question asking. The second goal is to teach you the persuasive selling format. And then the third goal is to make a finite workable list of people you'll talk to.

3:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK.

4:05 - Nate Jebb
  As we go through these six sessions, the ideas will be loosely related. won't feel like a very tight connection, like the persuasive selling formats of concept I want you to have.  When we get to the stage of like building out proposals and stuff, it won't tie in exactly. It's just I want you to have this concept.

4:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. Okay.

4:27 - Nate Jebb
  So here we go sales. It's easier to sell water to someone who's thirsty than someone who's not thirsty.

4:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's obvious.

4:43 - Nate Jebb
  But let's look at it. If you went into a gas station and you were not thirsty at all, the only real way they could get you to buy water is a really, really low price.  Like you're at the counter and it's Fiji water and it's 25 cents. Maybe you'd get it. If you adjust mode for a long time.  on. You might buy two bottles of $5 water, even if it was crafty, because you're truly your thirsty. Sure.  Great. Got it. So the question is, how do you make someone thirsty? And the answer is, you ask them questions.  They will tell you what makes them thirsty. So there's a principle in sales that the more the prospect talks, the more likely you are to learn what makes them thirsty.

5:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. question. Do you mind if I record this just for myself? I mean, there's the note taking, but in many if I record, because I think the demeanor, of course.  Thank you.

6:00 - Nate Jebb
  And you know you can export the fathom recording too if you want. It records as well.

6:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I thought it was just transcript. Well, anyway, yeah.

6:09 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, you can export the video. But, alright. We just did it. This is for the new recording. just did a brief overview of the basic principles of sales in our agenda.  Our agenda is to discuss persuasive question asking and persuasive selling format and making a fine networkable list of prospects that we can call.  The persuasive question asking is what we just covered and I said it's easier to sell water to someone who's thirsty than someone who's not.  How do we make them thirsty? ask them questions. They'll tell us what makes them thirsty. That's what we just discussed.

6:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

6:46 - Nate Jebb
  How do you get them to talk? People want to talk about their kids. They don't want to talk about your kids, so to speak.  They want to talk about their business. They don't want to talk about your product, your solution. So the persuasive question asking model is very, very simple.  And I'm going share my screen here. I believe I can. Actually, I don't know if a tab, an entire screen.  A white board? If I do that, will you be able to see? I'm starting when I've never done this.

7:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's right?

7:53 - Nate Jebb
  Okay. Can you see this white board?

7:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm opening a link. Yep. Yeah, I think, yeah, I see a whiteboard. There's nothing on it, but I can see it.  Okay.

8:10 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, we're, I would do this on the iPad, but. Okay, so now these are the word types of questions you can ask.  And someone, this is just kind of silly sales and go, just humor me.

8:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do they have an order?

8:54 - Nate Jebb
  Is the order is relevant? Yep. put them in line. I put them in a row. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.  Okay. You are trying to get to their value driver, which is the thing that if you can solve it, they will work with you.  So we try to never ask information questions if possible. You can ask them from someone lower level than the person you're talking to or you can find them online, but don't ask them, how many widgets do you buy a year?  How do you find, like, what is the market you're addressing? If there's something you could have found out beforehand, don't waste that time.  So issue question is this. What issues are you facing? They're going to look at you and they're going to be incredulous.  They're going to be like, really? going to ask it that on the nose like, and then you're going to have to be sincere and say, no, I'm serious.  What issues are you facing? They'll give you one and they'll give it to you like this. Well, I guess inventory is an issue.  Okay, now there's two pieces here that are the art of sales. The pause, and if you're in person or even if you're on digital, showing that you have a piece of paper that you are writing down what they are saying on, they need to see you write it down.  So if you can pull your camera back a little bit, they need to see you write it down.

10:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Quick parenthesis, I'm assuming it's better if they see me physically writing down, then typing on the computer.

11:01 - Nate Jebb
  Yes, do not type it. Write it down. This is almost like feeder. Okay.

11:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Write it down.

11:08 - Nate Jebb
  Look up at them. Well, I said there's two pieces of art. So the pause is one of the most important pieces of sales you can have.  And you get the idea. It's just ask a question. How does the pause make you feel?

11:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to step in. Always.

11:32 - Nate Jebb
  And you have to bear the discomfort, the discomfort yourself. Do not talk. So you ask a question. You pause.  You write down their answer. After they tell you, for example, well, inventory is an issue. Then you say this.  What else? They're going to say something else. Well, we're having trouble with our staffing and what else? They're going to keep going.  Now, it's important. You can say, and you should say little things like this. Really? Let them know you care by giving them small moments that recognize you're listening.  Wow. Tell me more about that. Do not add content. Don't interrupt. Don't finish their sentence. I call that name that tune.  Don't go, this makes me think of that.

12:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do not do that a lot.

12:31 - Nate Jebb
  Do not do that in this conversation. That's fine when you and I are riffing and we're playing jazz together.  That is not what we're doing here. Remember, remember this. The more the prospect talks, the more likely you will find out what you need to know.  The more they talk, the more likely you will find out what you need to know. If you keep asking what else, there will come a  point, there always does, where they go. I think that's it. Those are my issues. They're done talking about them.  At that point, right here, confirm that you heard them. This serves two purposes. One, it lets them know that you're listening.  And two, it makes sure that you actually did hear it. Sometimes you got it wrong what you wrote down.

13:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I repeat it back to them. Yeah, every single piece.

13:35 - Nate Jebb
  you say this, I just want to make sure I've heard you. Your issues are inventory, staffing, list all of the issues.  If they say yes, that's it, you've got it. Now you have a complete issues list. Now you're going to ask them to sort the issues.  So, impact, this is all you ask, out of all of these issues, which issue, if we solved it, would have the biggest impact on your business, which issue if we solved it would have the biggest impact on your business.  Well, really truthfully, inventory doesn't matter, that's a really, that's kind of a long-term thing. We have people turning over almost every week on the paint line, and it takes a couple weeks to get them cleaned up, so we're having these missed orders and, great, circle it.  Now they might give you a couple. It doesn't have to be like, no, no, no, I only said the most important, let them talk.  more they talk, I'm going to just keep repeating myself because you've got to learn it. The more they talk, the more more  more likely you'll hear what you need to know. So whatever they say, circle the impact one. And then say, now we sort by importance, which is basically timeliness.  Which one of these issues needs to be solved right now? Wait, excuse me.

15:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So first, we sort by impact. Yeah.

15:26 - Nate Jebb
  Yep. Now you know which one's going to have the biggest effect. But now you have to ask a question about timing, because sometimes it's the case that, yeah, they'd like to solve that.  But they have this meeting coming up, a quarterly meeting in a month and a half, and if they do not do it well, they will lose their job.  Which, by the way, always pay attention to them saying personal things. Like, if I don't get this right, I'm going to lose my job.  That nothing is a bigger flag than that. That's very, very important if it affects them personally. You sort by importance, which of these issues needs to be solved the most urgently?  Okay, they're going to sort now and ideally it would be something like this, but if not importance wins, right?  The one that has to be solved right now is what you're going to solve. Then say to them, and here's the format, if I can do x, would you want to hear how I would do it?  What is x? Solve that issue. driver statement, you say this. If I could solve x issue, would you want to hear how I could solve it?  Yes, yes, I would definitely want to hear that. Of course they would want to hear that. They just told you it.  These are all my issues. is the most important. most impact. So you pick the one that's the most, and you say if I could solve the staffing issue, would you want to hear how I could solve it?  Yes. Then you say something like this, okay. I can't tell you right now how I would solve it. I can tell you kind of, but it would be a half baked cake.  A fully baked cake will taste better. Can we meet, now book the next meeting, can we meet a week from today at this time, which by the way is a good language that usually works, but if you need to do something else, you can.  Can we meet a week from today at this time to go over how I would solve that issue? Yes.  Great. Thank you. It's been wonderful to meet with you today. I'll see you in a week. End the meeting.  End it. Don't talk more. Don't have more light conversation. Get out. That is the concept because you're getting them the list.  Everything they need. You're getting them the sort of you're getting them to actually give consent to you to present how you would solve this is so much better than coming in and saying what you do they don't care they don't want to hear about your kids they want to talk about their kids so now let's pause i'm now going to show you what you do in the next meeting which is the persuasive selling format but let me let me stop and let's think through it what is going on in your mind as i share all of this so it's very reassuring there's there's a method to it that so even if i'm not a natural i can lean on this and i'm also thinking that i need to get quite a few repetitions that's another issue like opportunity to practice the stuff but i mean that that's

19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  something else. I can probably figure that out. The biggest factors to me was making it really about them and managing the frame, writing things down, even the jacket.  There's a whole game-face sort of aspect to it that it brings to me.

19:38 - Nate Jebb
  Game-face, that's a great phrase. Okay, so you like that it's a method, it's clear, it's concrete.

19:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You could do this.

19:55 - Nate Jebb
  You could do that right now. Then you're realizing, but I'm gonna have to practice it. You like that it's about them, about them, and then write it down.  That's the art. There's the science, which are these questions, and then there's the art. Okay. One other thing I want to tell you.  Sales is teachable, learnable, and repeatable. It is a valid learning environment. It is a known skill. It can be taught.  It can be learned. It can be done again and again and again and again and it will work. That's encouraging to know.  And it can be done sincerely and in a way that helps, not in a way that feels false or manipulative.  Okay, so now let's go over the persuasive selling format. Can you take a screenshot of this?

21:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've already got it.

21:26 - Nate Jebb
  All right. Okay. This is a framework for like a trellis. You know how plants grow in the trellis? A structure that you can hang your thoughts on so that you are very clear?  compelling when you present your solution. Here's how it works. Give a summary of what you discussed last time because things change and if something's changed in their world and you watch into a solution and it no longer means anything to them you're gonna miss it.  Reconfirm. Mr. Thomas. Whatever your client's name is.

22:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mr. Thomas.

22:38 - Nate Jebb
  Last time we spoke you said that staffing turnover on the paint line was your biggest issue and you wanted to hear how I could solve that.  Is that still your biggest issue? Yes. Okay. Here's how I can solve it. We're going to recruit from colleges.

23:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the idea part. Correct.

23:19 - Nate Jebb
  So the idea, you have to state in ten words or less. Your solution has to be ten words or less.  How are we going to solve the staffing changes? We're going to start recruiting from colleges. Here's how that works.  We know that business school students, I wouldn't say like that. Here's how that works. We're going to go meet with business school teachers at local colleges.  We're going to figure out if they. have students who want actual experience in a manufacturing environment. We're going to ask to be introduced to those students.  We're going to meet with each one-on-one and have been committed to a three-month employment engagement. These are people from good families.  They're interested for a very intrinsic motivation. They will stay for three months. Here's the value to you. You will stop the, now we're on to value.  You will stop the bleeding. If it takes at least two weeks to transfer knowledge for how to do this pain line work, you will get a full staff that will know how to do the work and be able to stop these mis-sent parts.  That is not the full solution in Time we can come up with what we're going to do next. This is what we have to do now The value key was you'll stop the bleeding If we do this you and I are committing to an 180-day agreement And you will pay us 20% Of the billables 20% of what you pay these students over the course of the three months they work for you How's that sound you want us to start hiring students for you today The part about maybe I'm being a bit too square about this, but the part about if we do this You and I will commit to something something days that's within value or closer to close That was I get it wrong that  would have explained that under how.

26:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, you know, but I'm kind of ad-willing this for you.

26:06 - Nate Jebb
  But how would be what are all of the details? what are we going to do together? Then you reemphasize the value of that.  And what it is, all that value is is you restate the need, but you say it is a solution.  So you said the need before is you feel like you're going to lose your job if you don't fix these paint line issues.  You can fix these issues and save your job in the next two weeks. Do you want to do that?  So, you're right. The way I did it was out of order, but it's what's going on with you. Here's the solve in 10 words or less.  Here's how all that works. This is why that's valuable. then you have to ask the girl out on a date.

26:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you want to do that?

26:58 - Nate Jebb
  And if they say no. That's fine. Part of this, part of the art of it is, who cares? They're allowed to say no, and if they say no to you, I would say something like this.  That's fine. We don't have to work on this. I'd like to turn this into a learning opportunity. Why are you saying no?  They may say something that clears up the issue and you could actually help them, or they may give you a really helpful thing that you'll be able to use for later.  But that's how that works. So, this is an overly idealistic framework that I'm using. It doesn't actually flow that way in conversation, but the main points do.  Okay. Now, I'm realizing this is very content heavy, and I know it's not hard for you to grasp it, but like we have to actually metabolize it into something I'm realizing that instead of making a finite workable list.  What I'd like to do is give you one more concept and Then just some light homework And so this session even though I intended it to be like the beginning of a series of things we could do I feel like you just need to have the concepts in place before you go out and act Are you okay if I make that switch?  Yeah Okay, so you have that screenshot it, right?

28:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can just see Yeah, I do.

28:42 - Nate Jebb
  Thanks for checking Now I'm gonna teach you a high that was like how you have a conversation I'm gonna teach you a higher level concept about selling To groups of people because at this stage most people are making  King decisions as a group, not as an individual. I've seen this laid out as a two by two. I don't think that's helpful because it's like it's not really a matrix of any kind.  It's just there are four things you need to know when you're selling to a group. The first is do they have a critical business issue that you can solve?  I just taught you how to get to that, like we could have called that value driver, but that's asking questions where they go.  No, this is super, super important. We have a critical business issue. People have to have a problem, know they have a problem, and want to solve that problem.  That's what it means to have a critical business issue. They have to have a problem, something's actually wrong. They have to be aware that they have a problem, and they have to want to and be willing to act on solving that problem.  Now, they have to agree with our vision for how we would solve it. So if you see if you do the persuasive selling format, you're giving a vision of how you would solve that.  They have to agree with that. have to say that's a way that I would like its own. and they have to agree with the value of that solution for pricing your method they agree if those things are in place and I really do feel like it's probably better shorted like this if those are true you have to know what's going on at their company so you have to say how is this going to work politically who needs to buy into this who needs to be a part of our next meeting the reason for that is there you could have an entire like ERP enterprise you know okay you could have like SAP being sold into a company  and you're meeting with the CEO and he's bought in and he will do it. And his secretary who is his right hand person, she's been with him for 30 years, says, this is going to make my job harder.  I don't want it. He will. He could. And they do kill the deal simply because of that. So you have to know what's going on.  This is real. This is the truth about social nature of this. You have to ask them, I mean, who needs to be a part of this?  Who's going to be involved in this decision? They'll tell you. And then you need to plan out what you are going to do and when to make a final decision.  So here's how that flows. If the critical business issues, the persuasive question asking meeting. The vision and value is the persuasive selling format meeting, right?  If you quote and say, do you want to do this? And they say, yes. Then you go into these two things.  Same meeting. Okay, this is all the same meeting right here. Same meeting. That's a meeting. That's a meeting. So you would just ask who's who's involved, and then the sequence of events looks like this.  Well, Dan really needs to see this. Dan's in charge of our IT department, and if he doesn't agree with the software in general, he's not going to give you the support you need.  Dan needs to see this. Additionally, the fundraising team needs to sign off on this because it could feel like we're stepping on their toes, and a problem shouldn't be a God.

33:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right now, you are role playing the client answering my question.

34:00 - Nate Jebb
  Correct.

34:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I'm making up a new scenario.

34:01 - Nate Jebb
  I should have stuck with the staffing scenario, but I'm making up a new one. Okay, okay. So let's say they say Dan, let's stick with staffing.  Dan needs to be a part of it. He's the line leader on the paintline. And Nick needs to be a part of it.  He's the plant manager. He's going to end up approving things. They need to be in different meanings. Okay, great.  Who should we meet with first? You got to meet with Dan first because if the plant manager knows that the line leader signed off, he'll okay.  Okay, how do I meet with Dan? Well, I can book that meeting, the person saying that. I can book that meeting for you.  I'm saying, okay, what do you need to do? What's the next action for you to book that meeting? Well, I really just need to email Dan or actually shoot.  I'm going to meet with him later today. I'll ask him today. Great. Thank you. Will you ask him today?  Yes, I will. Okay, I'm going to send you an email tomorrow saying what did Dan say? If he said yes, did Dan say?  We're going to book that meeting together. and I will find the time. Yeah, great, sounds like a plan. So then you say, ask Dan in meeting today.  I will email my prospect tomorrow asking if Dan is willing to meet. So that's one thing we're doing next.  And then let's clear it up though. If Dan says yes, how do we get on the calendar with the plant manager?  Oh, that's so easy. He actually won't do a plan meeting. He always has open office hours at 2 p.m.  Wednesdays. I will give you his phone number. You can just call him. I'll let you know he's going to you're going to call him.  If that's good with Dan, I'll say, OK. you give me his phone number right now? Yes, here it is.  I won't call him, but like just so we're ahead of it. OK, yeah. Now we're going to meet with Dan like me next week.  And I say, can I meet with the plant manager? Can I call him two Wednesdays from today, which is October 15.  Always pin it to real days. We're going to do it on October 15th, Nate to call plant manager on October 15th.

36:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. When you're doing this, when you're saying out loud, think you're writing, you actually do say it out loud during the call.

36:19 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I'm saying I'm making, we are on a team now, me and the prospect.

36:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. And we're saying, what's our plan?

36:27 - Nate Jebb
  Well, we've got to meet with them. We've got to meet with the plant manager. I'm going to, you're going to talk to Dan today, I'll email you tomorrow.  If I don't hear back, I'll email you on Monday. And then once that's confirmed and we meet with Dan, I will call the plant manager.  When that's signed off, I'll call you and we'll figure out how to get this paperwork signed. Yes, Nate, that's a great plan.  to call prospect to figure out how to get paperwork signed and through the procurement department. I'm, I'm, again, I'm making all the stuff.  it's getting almost unnecessarily complex, but it is helpful for you to see this.

37:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, if I were to extract the patterns there is, say it back to them, go deep, get specific, both in the dates you say and the commitments you try to get.  You know, as much stuff that will help you recover from their forgetfulness. Like, if you get these numbers now, you get, it's like a save game, whatever.

37:38 - Nate Jebb
  Okay, that's what I'm getting. Okay, I'm going to get rid of this Jamboard now, so take a screenshot of this.  And I'm just going back to our screen. guess the Jamboard is still there, but I'm not looking at it now.  Well... me give you a path forward after this call. now you have the concepts. Now we're going to practice them.  And here's what we're going to do. We need to get you meetings. We need to get you basically the persuasive question asking meetings.  The way to do that is to call people who will today pick up your call. Now maybe you only have two people in your network that would do that.  That's fine. That's our list. That's those two people. Maybe you have 100. Fine. Let's make the list of 10 of them.  We need to call people and ask them to meet. So what we're going to do is this. We're gonna make what I call what the language I got from someone else is a finite workable list It's a list of someone you can call every Wednesday or whatever until you get an answer We need to make that list and we need to make what's called a fishing line The fishing line is basically like in a nutshell, what do you do?  Mm-hmm, and your fishing line is I hope consultants package their knowledge Sell it whatever it is. I don't know, but again, it's 10 words of us What we'll do Is make that workable list and you will call those people if you want to you don't have to but you will call those people And you'll say something like this.  Hey Well, you give me feedback on this. I'm working on something I'm working on Project where I have I have I have a process where I bring consultants from their head knowledge to a sellable product Can I present it to you and will you give me feedback on this?  That's someone who will pick up your call that listen to it. They'll give you feedback at the end of that call You can ask them Do you know anyone who I should talk to about that If they refer to you that's then your actual meeting the people you're calling that that's not your meeting That's just like your way of getting referrals The one other point I make is this word for me when I did it before is I Told my friends who I was gonna call I'd like to present you What I'm working on and ask for your feedback and if you think it's good at the end of the call I will ask if you know anyone  who I should talk to about it, and if you'll introduce me to them, that's a much better way. That way it doesn't come off as like you switched on them in the call.  So let me stop. That's all of the content I wanted to cover. That's it. It feels like an enormous amount to me.  Maybe it doesn't to you. Now what's going through your head?

  So I'm excited. I think the feeling is excited where I feel in my body is like, I can do this.  I can feel that some parts of it will be difficult, but not necessarily mysterious, which I think is really important for my kind of failure mode.  What usually happens to me is if I'm doing something new and I don't get results at first, and usually I don't, I assume that there's something wrong with my approach and then I get discouraged.  Because I'm trying to get it from first principle, some things that are new to me. And this thing, I can see that I would...  Don't hit it the first time, or the first dozens of times, I don't know, but it makes sense that I know this has been kind of validated.  So that's encouraging. For when, eventually, I will find like uncomfortable times. It was also very interesting to see that the finite work of all this is not the people that will buy necessarily from me, because that was kind of my resistance to that idea that, oh, but there's people here that, you know, they're not just my friends, but still, I don't know what to tell them about, right?  I don't know. Yeah. And again, I think it's a principle of separating things, right? They are stepping stones into someone else.  I also like the fact that it makes it easier for them. I like the fact that the Last thing you said of, know, coming clean, I don't know, coming clean right at the start.  Yeah.

43:06 - Nate Jebb
  I think that's interesting as well.

43:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there's, and I was trying to kind of make notes as I went, but then I've realized that I'll just, on my notes it just says, check the transcript because there's so much detail.  I think I'll need to watch this a few times and pick up on different things. I don't want to get too nerdy about it and not take action, but there's, there's a lot of very good stuff here.

43:38 - Nate Jebb
  So thank you, great response. You're so, um, you're articulate about your internal experience. When you said that it will be difficult, but not mysterious, that language I found was really helpful even to me because I think that's where I get discouraged too, I'm like, I get it wrong, but I don't know why, and then I do give up because it  feels like. I'm feeling in the dark for a light switch and I just can't feel it. What am I going to do?  So that's that was really good. And then I'll just tell you, I mean, this is really dense. I, this is stuff I got over the course of 10 years of asking a ton of different mentors questions.  And then I've practiced teaching it many, many times. So it's like, it is the surface level. And it will really only make sense once we start doing it.  But I feel like I just gave you a massive amount of stuff. Even though it's kind of like superficial, it was like, here's a meeting.  Here's another meeting. Here's the general framework. It feels very dense to me. I don't, and I think it felt that way to you because you said you'll rewatch the recording.  So I think what we'll do going for the next session is in preparation. I won't, let's not even have you do homework because you and I, I don't think that really works for us.  Let's just add the next session, make that list together and the way we're going to make it probably is we'll go through your email or your phone, just your contacts and you'll just be scrolling through the phone and I'll be typing for you and you're like, I guess I could call that guy, again, the only thing we're saying is what they take your call.  So let's just make the list, you know, and that's what we'll do next time and then we'll make a plan.  We'll probably do some role play of like what are you going to say on those calls. So as long as you practice it with me and it'll feel, if we actually do this, it's going to be a very intense level of focus because the best way to do it is to practice it 50 times, even if it's just a 30 second explanation.  So if we do that together, the first like three or four times we'll feel like, oh, it's kind of fresh, then times four through like 30 are going to be like, why are we doing this?  It'll feel awkward because you're going to be like. I get it basically I get it and you need to get bored with it and it needs to be burned into your head and then times 30 through 50 you might be able to see like Hey, I'll tweak this or else week that but we will have to push through a kind of like social Awkwardness like you and I aren't awkward together, for some reason when I've done that with people it does just feel awkward But it's like a very intense level of focus come prepared to really focus Because I'm like drilling you on your line.  Okay, now say it this way. I'll say it that way No little nudges, but if we get that down then when you pick up the phone, you're not gonna feel scared.  You're just gonna do it Dead that's so key.

46:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean practicing on on on the Yeah, if I have Obviously my my skill of getting calls is still at the beginner level and so and they all all of them seem very important Sensitive and then I get there without a lot of practice and of course I I'm nervous about it  That's right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it just makes complete sense. All right, man.

47:04 - Nate Jebb
  Well, I know our time's up. I'm sure you have to go. Thank you for doing this with me. I worked so hard to get this knowledge and because I'm young, no one really is like, Nate, how do we do this?  don't look to me for it. But it's like, it feels so exciting to give it to you because like it was so hard to get.  And I know it's good. mean, like I told you, some of it's from the guy who ran Procter and Gamble Sales College for 11 years.  it's good stuff. No, it's fantastic stuff.

47:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, I honestly think that this is life-changing, and I'm sure that decades from now, I'll remember these conversations and I mean, you've carved a place into my existence is really  I think it's really a big deal. So thank you.

48:02 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, you're gonna you will succeed greatly because all there is to it is repetition and I know you're willing to put in the reps.  Okay. All right, man. I'll talk to you next week at this time if you can. I can.

48:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

48:19 - Nate Jebb
