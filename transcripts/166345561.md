  recording now. Okay, so this is a personal idea note. I had an idea for a project that helps people find hobbies for loved ones.  This was inspired by the need of my wife to find a hobby for her dad and the way I envisioned the system it has in terms of a journey it contains like three stages.  To find a hobby for someone you first begin by looking into their personality like Myers-Briggs sort of thing then you look into their history, narrative, what they've done, know, how they talk about their past and third you organize a thematic set of experiences so people can you know try out different hobbies but then try out these hobbies based on you know who they are, how they work, how they think about themselves and so on.  So I can see this being shaped in different ways. From a software perspective, I can see this being like a website that has a domain, something like needthehobby.io and multiple sub-domains, for instance, sub-domain my father, sub-domain my mother, sub-domain my girlfriend, sub-domain my brother.  Dot needs a hobby.io. So we just one domain we could have multiple, serve multiple audiences and kind of niche down anyway.  And I think the basic level of this is just make some sort of an assessment of help someone make some sort of an assessment about their loved ones, and then make some suggestions of hobbies they could try.  There's probably something around here for lead generation or something, but that feels too complex for now. And I also think we could mix this with a thing they're like sort of thing.  So, you know, we get an assessment, we make suggestions and maybe people can just say, I don't want these suggestions, right?  In the assessment, you can include stuff like, oh, I don't want to spend any money or I like to do things on my own or I have some sort of physical inability.  Things that allow us to just make suggestions that are not so much related to the accuracy of the personality assessment, they can just be very logistical, very easy to get right on the first try.  I can see these being paired with some sort of physical product, like a deck of cards, where you make the assessment and then you get the cards, the physical cards and the cards include something like a stand where you could put the card of a hobby that you could experiment with, something in a place that you can see, something that invites self-reflection, maybe a diary or something like that, and maybe do the assessment online and when you receive your package, it comes with, you know, personalizing stuff.  instructions on what are the most relevant cards for you. I don't know about this. Yeah, I think that's kind of it.  I mean, there's a lot of things around this. The process of finding interests was based on a conversation I had with Proplexity AI.  And yeah, I think there's something here. That's it.
