0:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Nice. Where are you in Brazil? I'm in the south of Brazil, so it's not next to the sea.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like 90 kilometers to the sea, but it's kind of a weird thing because at this sea level and then there's a mountain and that mountain drops a little bit and then there's my city.  My city is on a plateau surrounded by mountains, so it's very often cloudy.

0:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, okay.

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the road to the beach is really nice. mean, I'm European like you and I didn't go up to this kind of vegetation.  The road to the sea is a little bit like Jurassic Park.

0:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, that's cool. We have also a lot of rain here. are very, very rainy, a rainy city. I mean, we have a nice weather, but it's also often rainy here because we have a mountain also that's really close to the sea and then because of the geograph.  It stops there. Yeah, and then the rain is quite often. but we do get the nice weather we cannot complain so yeah that's usually it's very Mediterranean that that's picture yeah the white window as well yeah it's completely yeah what city you live in uh i mean it's a city rieka it's called rieka like it's actually translated to river or yeah it would be the translation river but rieka is the name it's on the west of Croatia it's in the yeah r r i j e k a i found it i found it yeah it's the pictures are amazing yeah it's the best thing about the city is the location again because we have we are very close to the mountains to the Italian Alps to the Austrian Alps Slovenia also we have a nice Dalmatia is really close by so south of Croatia and everything so Istria which is nice part of Croatia so basically it's a very good location to be honest it's everything is called by so we can have a nice so we can get the  is easily so yeah that's that's nice did you grow up there or did you move there yeah i'm i'm born and raised here so basically my whole life i've been living here so yes and the further i get the the the more i don't want to move so yeah yeah yeah sometimes when i grow up how many people do you have there it's a city of 100k something like that it's a small city in the worldwide terms but in Croatia it's like a third i think or fourth city third city by the size yeah yeah so i grew up in a small city like 30 000 people and when i was there all i wanted to do was leave and i think when i retire maybe it becomes more interesting again because it's it's very quiet and so on yeah part of their lives also yeah exactly and then where were in the brazil what's the name of the city you're living i could eat you but i can write the name underneath

3:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's on the chat. The cool thing, I don't know if you like capybaras, but there's capybaras in the parks.  You can go to park and see a capybara, but that's it.

3:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, you're actually, it looks really close to the sea, but as you say, you have a mountain in between.  see, yeah. Cool, cool. I would like to visit Brazil once. would be interesting.

3:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the nearest thing that's really interesting from here, but it's like 800 kilometers, is the waterfalls, the Iwassu waterfalls.  Oh, cool.

3:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  They're real large, but it could give us not really a touristic city. Yeah, I mean, it's smaller for Brazilians.  I think it's smaller one, right?

3:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Relatively, it's, I think the broad, it's like the metropolitan area is probably 3 million people.

3:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, then that's not small. Cool.

3:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  By the way, so in terms of work. Romeo's car got broken in last night.

4:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  He sent us a picture of the broken window.

4:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think he's fine. But he had to take the car to the repair shop. And he did send some stuff on the dashboards.  But I'm also working with him to fix some details. OK. Do you think if we fix the details today, it's still on time for you guys?

4:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it is. If you need some feedback, let me know. Right now, we can go over it then. Maybe we can use this moment for that.  Sure. No one else is coming. OK. So I'll share my screen.

4:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think we had a little bit of a miscommunication. So I'm working with him to correct some things.  But overall, this is what we're focusing on. A section for each chart happens within a subsection. Right? There's charts for GIFs and hospitality and we should mark it accordingly and this is not fully complete because of that miscommunication but that's the logic we're following like H2 chart with name we're following the same logic of the charts.

5:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  Forget the carbon reporting stuff somewhere in here we're going to need to show carbon reporting stuff and that will be so for now what we have from information is definitely carbon reporting needs to be shown here these controls or whatever yeah whatever kpi app and Brighton gave you I actually don't know those kpi apps but whatever they gave you plus carbon reporting results so some kind of numbers actually also the exact numbers but they should be visible in that excel spreadsheet that they share so we can find that easily.

5:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect and actually this is what I'm talking to you is this the because I understand that we've been copying like

6:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  styles from other assets on the Figma and for instance this thing I don't think is very useful so I told us to change this towards a more templated thing okay do you agree with that or do you think this is yeah both are doable to be honest I think so if you go to uh can you open just app test department and go to slash therefore maybe I can also exist but the dummy dummy there was actually exists okay I'll send it a link so just just delete everything so here so if you go to the basic link so it's basic url you will see the graphs we have I think you copy  design, which is good. So that's what we already have implemented. Then we just need to add numbers. This is dummy data, course.  This is not working. This is just some random numbers, fixed static numbers. But basically, these two graphs, there are not many graphs here, but we can easily have these two graphs.  that's completely fine. And from what I see, more or less in line with what you have there. And if you keep this, I think we'll be fine there.  So I would say, basically, to summarize, the answer would be yes, that's okay. That's got it. We can think if we have some extra time, we can think about a little bit more advanced styling on the charts.  But I think we are flexible there also.

7:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now that I'm talking to you, I'm thinking that perhaps, so share this step. Right now, we're going into this direction.  It's chart into a box, right?

8:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  you and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking that maybe it would make more sense to have a box with multiple charts like this and the box has a name and then we can collapse the box like I don't want to see anything about whatever gives an entertainment and just yeah to to be honest I from the dev side it's the same for us maybe a bit easier the first one the one you already did but from the product perspective I have no idea what will be the most useful I think the usefulness will come when they will be able to rearrange that dashboard and you know move the boxes they find most important to the top of that usual stuff so hello gonna run out of battery but if I do I would turn on my phone yeah sure we were just discussing the dashboard so any thoughts or questions or like is Romeo on we could share some of the

9:00 - A L
  No, not the dashboard. just looking at it now. Okay. Yeah. So this room is kind of got broken in last night.

9:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Every is okay, but he's handling that. So that's why it's not on the call.

9:13 - A L
  Um, so dashboard. Yes. Yes. And okay.

9:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, yeah. So basically we're moving into this direction and Romeo and I were adjusting some, some details to make it better.  Based on, on some, some feedback and was just showing it to, to even to, to see if it's easy to, or it's in line with what we have developed.  And it's easier to, to produce.

9:46 - A L
  I guess my question is like, how do you filter from E S and G on, on this here? Cause right now, I only see G.  Like, how do they filter from the different ones? Like if they wanted to see more of the details. Mm hmm.

9:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So. I would guess we could use the same toggles that we used in some of the stages, we could bring them here, that's possibility.

10:12 - A L
  And then the other thing is the test management, because as part of the dashboard, we wanted, unless we decide, because our original dashboard had test management on the right side of it.  Maybe we can put that on the home page.

10:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  My question is currently the initial idea was home page plus dashboard. But my question is do we still want to have those two pages separate or the dashboard will be your home page, what do you think?  What would be happy a home page for you as a compliance officer when you come to the app? What do you expect, a dashboard like page or a home page with some mix of dashboard and tasks and bunch of other stuff?  It's a good question.

10:49 - A L
  I would say if I were using this on a day-to-day basis, would be tasks, right? It's a reminder of what I need to do.  And then I would use the dashboards more as like monitoring or reporting. So I would either like it like we had in the beginning where there's some like Dashboards that I can click into and get more but then mainly see the task But I'm not so not against having one dashboard page and one task page because like Then they could just start at the task and then they can go to the flip to the dashboard If like if there's too many dashboards that you can you can't fit both tasks on it Then that can be a possibility, but I would probably start a task Yeah, we can then have a dashboards like that reports only and then home page can mix of tasks and That's like some critical dashboard data.

11:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Yeah Equally important That's very good.

11:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think also because we can give people a certain way of customizing their home page Without giving them too much freedom that makes it difficult to For instance, like let's roleplay this so the home page includes a short view on tasks, right?  and also like a few selected charts from the dashboard, right? if you tell people, you can even select which three charts you want to have on the front page.  We are already giving them a sense of, I can customize this, but we are putting some boundaries on that so they don't look crazy and they don't ask for infinite changes.  So I like that idea of having that possibility. So the homepage, the idea of the homepage, as I understand, the first thing you see when you open the platform on the start of a new day, you see what's happening, anything that you need to pay attention to.  But if you want to go deeper on anything, there's probably a task management page that you see all the tasks like for three months ahead.  And you can also see the dashboard page where you can see every number for everything, right? OK. Yeah, so I think we are in the right direction.  I think that's it in terms of the dashboard.

13:05 - A L
  Okay, yeah, because then we have to make a task management page, right? That's another, I guess, another part. Yvonne, do you have all the graphs like from the E, S and G and how they would be displayed?  if, I guess, like Brighton has created something. Like, do you don't need that visualized? This is enough for you.  Like, we should have an ESG tab, Yeah, I just mean, I need that.

13:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't have access to that file, or I don't know where it is. The file that Brighton shared. So if you could share it in Slack, it would be great.  And then, yeah, I don't need every graph drawn on the UI. I just need to know where the filter goes and what happens under each filter and what data is shown for each.  And then for me, it's enough to know which type of the chart is. So bar chart, line chart, a radial chart, or just a number.  And the design for that chart, which, for example, we know how bar chart here looks like. So we just need to put.  the data. So we don't have to design every case, but I would need examples of each case. I'm not sure why, if you understood me, yeah.

14:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm just asking.

14:14 - A L
  Yeah, please ask her to share it in play or somewhere so I can...

14:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She sent me the PDF earlier today, I can send it on the... Okay, yeah, share it in the channel.

14:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I just sent her a message, she said yes.

14:24 - A L
  She'll do too, but you can also do it. Okay, good. You can make the dashboards at least as part of the control thing, right?  Because on Wednesday you'll be tomorrow, you can start working on this, is that... Yeah, I think so, but probably end of day.

14:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Today we are still working on asset management. So I'm hoping today or tomorrow morning we'll be done with asset management, and then we are starting the dashboard right after that.  The question is, do we want to make a release before the adverts or not? And I think we can wait until...

14:59 - A L
  I don't how long do you think...

15:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  So this I don't think will take too much, probably a couple of days, but also what I mentioned is here we also need a way to show carbon reporting stuff, so the question of how will carbon reporting be here, because gist and hospitality is one control and we'll probably have the same, more or less same format for all controls, you'll have gist and hospitality, anti-corruption or all these lined up one after another, but carbon reporting is a bit specific, I guess.  So it will probably be on the top or somewhere, I don't know, I just want to know. like ES and G, and then we filter for E ones and then G.  Yeah, so carbon reporting will just be something under E and that's it. Yeah. That's fine. This is not complex to do, but it will take maybe two days, three days.

15:46 - A L
  You think by like Monday we would be able to release it with the dashboards? Maybe Monday, Tuesday. I would say early next week.

15:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would aim for that. I would try to aim for that. I think it would be good if it's Monday or Tuesday that we have the dashboards.  then they can actually see what it kind of it kind of goes the other thing I have to get in touch with borna and see how I need to see the data the one that the file you will share on select and then I'll talk with borna also we'll together see how difficult will it be or how much time will will it take us to extract the data but I don't expect any problems there to be.

16:19 - A L
  Yeah because then you're saying like dashboard Monday like like and or to then like third-party management soon after that then like then third-party management needs to be ready by Tuesday or something so that it could uh.  Tuesday but no we cannot do it in a day third-party management.

16:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh I know but I mean by Tuesday they should have we should have the design for third-party. yeah yeah okay yeah that's fine by then.

16:42 - A L
  I'm gonna be I'll probably be on the plane tomorrow at the meeting so I don't know if there's anything Romeo can send before otherwise you can have the meeting tomorrow and I can join the one on Thursday um but I guess well there was another one that was due today but I guess that's due tonight that was  That's like, because he had like something on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, right? The integrity hub is Wednesday, Tuesday is third party, but I don't know.  So yesterday he sent dashboard, third party would be until today.

17:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the original, the data timeline as of yesterday was that third party would be sometime today, yes. Okay.

17:26 - A L
  Because I didn't see this, like, when did he send this? I missed in Slack or did he not put it in Slack?

17:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is in Slack on Fortify Design.

17:36 - A L
  I've been in back-to-back meetings and I'm just thinking if I can look at, give feedback on the third party before I go on the plane.  But I can see when he has it. But okay, but then I think we're okay, right? Yeah. This is the question about, yeah, task management, right?  To begin at least get some in. And then like we could also think about, on it's like a demo, like I'm starting to get requests from like potential customers about like either getting a demo or like even potential consultancy partners.  don't know what is our best like is there one that we can like fill in with like you know information and they can like click around with like where we feel like you know I don't know.

18:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  organization that can be demo organization which will not be affected by anything we do in theory. you will have two accounts and be there demo or something or demo user and you can log in and give out those accounts to the users.  We can also that's one thing we can also create for new demo purposes we can create always a new organization.  For example you are demoing to organization one event one we can create organization for them specifically give them blank slate and let them play with it and then we can later delete it or just leave it or whatever.  So we can do both of these things depending on what you prefer.

18:54 - A L
  I think it would be good to at least have one demo that you could that has like details in it because when I went

19:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  through it today it got it was cleaned out so there was no when I went to the employee portal there was no like read the portal or read the stuff you know that like it would be nice to have and like one like you know deployment that has like fake names so you can see the deployment and how to follow up on the stats you know so just like one demo that has like a little bit filled with like so test environment is the one we will be wiping constantly working blah blah I would just pick a one on production I don't see there a problem because it should be it should be fine it should have the latest but if we see the need we can easily spin up another demo environment so we will have test production and demo we can see when the need comes please let me know a couple of days in advance so we can prepare and do it what's what's needed to so that you can share it or show it or whatever you need just because even if we wanted to show the dashboard it'd be great to have a demo environment where like you know there's numbers actually the dashboard where it makes us yeah that's actually a good point we can we can create organization ourselves and demo organization and fill it in with numbers because then there we can do  But everyone we can fill in the employees list like 10 to 20 employees or something, give some employees then we'll fill it out some month and so on, we can create something, but please give me at least couple of days notice for that one, we need to do it.  It's not the problem, but it will take some time to do it just to do all this. Okay, great.  That's a good idea. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah.

20:22 - A L
  Okay.

20:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. And I think we're all good then, right?

20:27 - A L
  So have a safe trip.

20:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  See you on Thursday then, but yeah, thanks a lot. Perfect.
