0:00 - Patrick Kizny
  Oh, yeah, this meeting is being recorded greasy.

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So thank you.

0:12 - Patrick Kizny
  Thank you. Thank you for your compliment. Tell me where you are and how can I help you?

0:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so. Okay, so basically, I was putting together that homepage, right? And it's very obviously, and I don't mind copying the Fletch PMM approach.

0:36 - Patrick Kizny
  What is Fletch PMM approach?

0:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know these guys, Fletch PMM?

0:41 - Patrick Kizny
  No.

0:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so they are on LinkedIn and they talk about go-to-market for B2B SaaS companies. And they have this website.  They're really good on LinkedIn. And they have this website.

0:57 - Patrick Kizny
  Share the screen with me.

0:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's better.

1:04 - Patrick Kizny
  Do you play music? no.

1:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is Fletch, the website, but they're much more active on LinkedIn.

1:20 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm seeing your screen.

1:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You don't see anything?
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/VuWNLeMYwoHKsZzcwj7HP9kqQycQt96Y?timestamp=84.34603

1:24 - Patrick Kizny
  No. Oh, now I see.

1:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I didn't play. I didn't press the last OK button. So, okay. So this is their website.  And, you know, as a designer, I've been spending a lot of time thinking, oh, how should my website be and that kind of thing?  And then I got tired of it and said, I'm just going to copy some guys that seem to know what they're doing.  Why do I think they know what they're doing? Because everything else that they share on LinkedIn and the price increases, the case studies they have.  It tells me that they are getting work, right?

2:00 - Patrick Kizny
  No, no, no, how about the way internet works and the work the way being successful on internet work is that it's a financial pirate meaning you only start succeeding once you start convincing people that you succeed.

2:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay.

2:21 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay.

2:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very grandfather sit on my lap and let me tell you something about the world.

2:28 - Patrick Kizny
  No, seriously.

2:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think, yeah, I get it.

2:32 - Patrick Kizny
  get it.

2:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, anyways, anyways, I mean, you know, I've been speaking to these guys, other people I've been speaking to them.  I think Alex himself talks to them. So I think they are legit enough, basically. And so I just copy their structure.  Okay, so I don't have this part, but I have like, oh, the problem, the solution, the process. And then I don't have the video, I don't have this.  stuff. But then I was trying to get to this place, right? And basically I got stuck because I suspect that for the stage that my company is in right now, it would be better to have something that's very easy to say yes to, like a very simple product that people can buy, even if I could do more things, right?  Because this has been the usual challenge. Even if I can do more things. For now, I would like to get maybe a few repetitions into the something very simple, very easy to sell to build, you know, to flex that muscle and get testimonials, specific testimonials.  And I thought about making a website that was one thing, right? That's my thing. So far, so good. Is this

4:00 - Patrick Kizny
  coherence yes shall I start asking you questions or you you're getting at something no I was just trying to give you a context I don't want to you know start this monologue and then you have like questions you've been holding on for 15 minutes so okay right well first of all I would challenge you on copying a SAS landing page there they're not the SAS company oh but their website looks like a SAS company and the reason their website looks like a SAS company is because they sell to SAS companies yeah so let me ask you two questions are you a SAS company no are you selling to SAS companies no are you selling templates  And cookie gutter solutions up to a point.

5:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'd like to get there.

5:06 - Patrick Kizny
  Yes Okay So Do you see what I'm getting at?

5:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

5:18 - Patrick Kizny
  Yes, I do Right. So I go ahead. I think it's flawed thinking mm-hmm Simply because you start copying someone else's form and by the way Nothing wrong with taking shortcuts and I'm not encouraging you to reinvent the wheel But it's a matter of borrowing the right thing for your challenge.  So if you start with copying the form I'm not convinced to that because The reason it works for them is not because it's good, but it's because good  for them.

6:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, I understand.

6:02 - Patrick Kizny
  I understand. Well, you understand, you're a smart guy, you understand these things. So the first question is, what is it that you want to sell?  Secondly, who is buying it? And thirdly, what is the position of your website with respect to their investment in your relationship and to your sales process?  For questions, but crucial ones.

6:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I forgot the first one. First, what is it that you're selling? Yeah, okay. I'm selling the taster workshop thing, like creating your first workshop.  for consulting and agencies.

7:04 - Patrick Kizny
  For consulting and agencies. So consultants and people who are in, like, knowledge workers in expert business, you're teaching them...

7:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Trailer's ICP, sort of thing, yeah.

7:19 - Patrick Kizny
  So you're... So essentially when Max Trailer says, start your engagement with a small workshop, you're designing this workshop.

7:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct, yes.

7:28 - Patrick Kizny
  Lovely, that's a good position. That's a good, sweet starting product. Also, we have clarity. Second, who are you selling this to?

7:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So right now... Yeah, okay, I'll just go... Yeah, I don't have a lot of clarity on that. I mean, it's not very granular.  So I'm assuming... I based on what has been working out is like boutique consulting, kind of solo wish preneurs, but I don't want to sell to solopreneurs.  At this stage, I'll take it, but I don't to move to that place. mostly, know, yeah, experts that are facing that challenge of , mean, if I if people could see me work, they would get it.  But I, I don't have a way of talking about my work in a way that people understand what I do.  And then I cannot sales.

8:39 - Patrick Kizny
  Mm hmm.

8:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  These are the let me let me process that.

8:48 - Patrick Kizny
  So you're making a case that there are people out there who have expertise. But they cannot show it. tangible to their clients and therefore they cannot sell it or they cannot show it to the world.

9:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's the first case. So they feel competent at their craft or competent enough to try to make a living from it and they know that they know their .  But they really struggle with conveying that expertise and then there's several approaches into this, like there's the content people, the thought leadership aspect, there's all of that, but that's not my sweet spot.  My sweet spot is creating moments where you can put, you know, you can exercise your expertise in a way that people see you thinking, right, which is the workshop.  And yeah, that's it.

10:04 - Patrick Kizny
  Are you 100% sure, like, have you validated this?

10:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not fully. mean, everything is degrees of certainty, but I am confident enough to try to make an effort and put a stake on the ground on this.

10:26 - Patrick Kizny
  Have you been collecting any signals that you base this offering on?

10:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I've had interviews, not a lot, but a few interviews. And there's there's some patterns there. yeah, this is like, this is based on observation and conversation from people, like, oh, I know, I know myself.  But then they all they make all those mistakes in the way they communicate. Talk about how many years of experience of companies they've worked at.

10:58 - Patrick Kizny
  That's such a thing.

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if you probe a little bit they'll say stuff like yeah when people see me or like if I can get the work then they understand that I know what I need to do but oftentimes they need to do a lot of like it's a bit similar what happened with us right that we had that conversation about the toll booth that I think that I conveyed to you that I understood how to think about card games and card things because of that conversation right and and is this is this sort of situation like if you get if you can get sit with get to sit down with people and and work with them work through a problem with them one of their problems they're like oh okay yeah I like the way this guy approaches this thing and the signals I'm getting is that this is a common pain point and  people don't know exactly how to frame this. And then there's the signal of the productize thing, which I suspect creates a need in the market, but usually it doesn't really tell you how to do it, or doesn't give you too much detail.  oh, you should probably have done that, or you might not know exactly how to make the workshop. So yeah, does this answer your question?

12:36 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, it does. I have a bunch of thoughts, and the first question that I have is, okay, what am I sitting here for?  Am I sitting here to challenge you on your thinking?

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  reframe your thinking or solve the website communication issue because these are two different stories and I'm already tempted to challenge you on the on the problem not on the solution I think it's more I think it's more on the communication but for a simple point I think I suspect that we have a certain profile that we like to create our own maps you can give me a map but I'll need to like really make that map with you and then I'm like okay so I trust this map which is gonna be interesting but at some points is really really annoying for you as well so I figured that I'm pretty confident in the major aspects of the strategy there's some aspects of where I am less confident right for instance  I'm less confident in like the value ladder of my services. Does this make sense? Are you familiar with this?

14:16 - Patrick Kizny
  No, I'm frankly, I don't know what we're talking about. I'm not following your chain of thoughts. I lost the context.

14:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so in terms of your question, I think I'm more interested right now in the communication aspect. I think that's more immediate.  But I understand that there are things about the strategy that maybe we are unsure. But I'm just trying to...

14:44 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, so what is the communication problem or doubt or uncertainty that you have? Is it about what to say?  No. How to say that? Yeah, it's if it says what I think it says and what I think it I mean so my question to you is what do you think it says I think that's the best okay share the screen with me and I'll do a line read okay cool so what is it that I'm seeing sell the invisible with a workshop that's that's a good promise then the question the question is okay I start reading we help consulting coaching advisory and agency businesses make their unique expertise visible with customized workshops  I have two issues with that. The first one is why is it weak? You're a soloprenner.

16:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

16:11 - Patrick Kizny
  It's your method. It's your face. You're working with your with these people. I think the value is in your head, your thinking.  So I wouldn't fall for the trap of pretending I'm a company because you're losing on a huge amount of value and capital that you have being a real human person who delivers their head and their expertise directly to the client.  Because people don't trust brands anymore.

16:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  People trust people.

16:42 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. So by removing yourself out of the equation, you're shooting in your own. But that's the minor detail, but I would definitely fix it.

16:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm.

16:54 - Patrick Kizny
  Second, the problem I'm seeing is I don't understand how the workshop will make the expertise visible. I can understand that a workshop may make the expertise convincing.  Or gives me a taste of expertise. The question is, and this goes back to the strategy and the question I asked myself whether I should challenge you on thinking or on the communications.  At what stage is the problem? What is this workshop offering? What problem is it solving? of not being able to sell or not being able to communicate.  Like, if their problem is that their expertise is invisible, the solutions to that is making it visible as the first step, which is content, thought leadership, better storytelling, showing your expertise visually, whatever, yada yada.  It's a design and communications problem. To me, as soon as these problems are solved, you have enough traction with clients that they can invest in hiring you for a workshop because they have basic familiarity, understanding, and minimal level of trust or very low amount of risk related to low price of this workshop, then they want to give it a shot.  So it's not about visibility. It's about a taster or convincing or reassuring that it's a good bet. That's my thinking.  If you imagine a linear process, right, where you go from unaware to aware to interested and then to intent.  A workshop is like an intense stage, interest to intense stage in the journey. You see what I mean? I'm referring to super basic linear sales funnel or sales process map, is unaware, aware, interested, intent meaning.  brief lines on your desk, and then awarded or whatever, right? So a workshop facilitates a problem of going from low intent to high intent or like validating the shot before we start spending a lot of money.  So it's not about visibility. It's a later stage in the process. So it's about building a reassurance, increasing your credibility, demonstrating your value, not making the expertise visible.  I mean, when I say, yes, it's true that the workshop will make the expertise visible, but it doesn't work the other way around.

20:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure if you follow my thinking. No, no, I think it makes sense. I get it.

21:00 - Patrick Kizny
  should I scroll down or are going to let's let's think about it and Rob then okay work with mezozoic I think it's too early let's go back to the next question that I had for you we we understood what it is and we understood who are you selling to so then my next question was at which stage of the relationship with you the clients are or prospects are when they look at your website what do they know what do they know about you and what purpose is serving this website I have no idea the purpose of the website is I think it's just to have something

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's just to have something that I can send people, it's a bit like a presentation really. So I want to know more about your method that there's a website, you know.

22:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, so let's, let's map this journey. They already know you from social media probably correct. What are other sources of people that may ask you or may create an opportunity to show something like that to them?

22:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think referrals. Referrals. Ah, yeah.

22:37 - Patrick Kizny
  So you referred, you have a warm lead, they want something they need to learn more about who you are, how you work.

22:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

22:45 - Patrick Kizny
  Gotcha. So, with that aspect, it's not like super top of the panel website which drives traffic from the internet and builds.  Okay. and awareness of yourself and it's also not a converting point meaning they don't click buy workshop right now correct I would like them to do that yeah that's do you how do you sell your workshops I mean workshop design if I want to hire you today to design a workshop going with my deck of cards how do we move forward we schedule a conversation and I'll make you a few questions I'll ask a few questions and I figure out how you how you work then I try okay so that's a discovery code yeah yeah and then and then I'll input that stuff into a process that

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that I have that is, I mean, not fully set in stone, but it's, it has parts of it that are quite consistent.  And then we do it over a course of like four sessions. And then I deliver the stuff and that's it.

24:22 - Patrick Kizny
  When do I pay? How do I buy from you?

24:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You pay 50, 50% upfront. And then you pay 30% x before the finish. And then you pay the last bit on the liquid.

24:41 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, is it $100,000?

24:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's, it's kind of what I told you. This is around 5k USD.

24:50 - Patrick Kizny
  Right. I'm not fully convinced on why are you splitting this so much into three payments. But this may be something  I that as I get more authority and I get more known, I want to get fully upfront.

25:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But right now, I don't think I have that. I'm just, you know, trying to okay. Even, even like for me to earn the confidence of just saying, what, is this upfront?  Because I am not there, both in terms of market recognition and like self confidence. I'm just building that bridge to get back.

25:33 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, let me help you because there is a better way of building that bridge than by building a website for this and doing the reps.  The number you are mentioning, five brands, it's a low ticket offer, meaning not like crazy low $100 workshop, but generally it's a low ticket offer.  Because if you look at this, case of like solos and consultants and coaches and people like that. You know, the typical range they charge is something between, you know, 5k to 30, something like that.  Right. So, and that's solo premise. When you go to an agency or start working with agency or like agencies are becoming your client.  Even a small agency is something around between $1 million and $3 million, right? In revenue. So they are used to seeing much higher bits.  Like if you run a typical agency that turns over $3 million a year, they probably have 10 clients, which each of them  things you 150 to 300k, right? And it splits into some projects. So these are easily five, five to six figure projects that they do.  Meaning 30, 50, 100, 150, right? So if you're selling to an agency, even if they hire a freelancer to do a design or whatever, they are used to paying 5, 10, 20 grand, whatever that is, right?  I mean 20 would be a larger figure. So generally, this is a quick and easy product. And it's for sessions.  It's something small. So there is absolutely no reason to split that into more than one payment.

27:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

27:55 - Patrick Kizny
  In my opinion. If you are dealing with people that, and generally, if people... There are two kinds of clients that you'll find along the way.  There are people who like to move fast and they validate you, they vet you, you're already vetted, and they want to get the  done.  You can easily charge them 5 or 10k or even 20 in one go and they wouldn't have a problem.  Moreover, these are people that will be happy to pay you one invoice instead of dealing with splitting 5 grand into 3 different payments.  Simple reason is that they are too busy to deal with multiple payments and their accountants are too busy and it just doesn't make any sense, right?

28:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

28:49 - Patrick Kizny
  It's like when you go to buy an ice cream, would you like to pay $5 up from before you order it and $5 when they...  hand it over.

29:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I wish I could do that. I love that. No, I get it.

29:11 - Patrick Kizny
  Small figure, make it quick and easy. Five grand, eight ones done. Upfront. The other reason for that is that it's psychology of sales.  When people sell you something I mean, when you buy something and the money changed hands, your client will be doing everything possible to justify and validate their decision that they've made, right?  They gave you five grand. Five grand, they will make everything to make it feel to them it was the right decision.  However, if they give you one thousand and then they have have to give you another 1,000, and then they have to pay another 3,000 5,000 at the end.  This incentivizes them to find reasons to delay, drag, and not to do it. So long story short, you should have one single payment up front.  It's about presenting process. So you have to present a problem. And you have to present a solution, and ideally get  the get exposure or like get more personal with these people. So the way I would do it is I would do two things on the website.  First, introduce the perspective or the problem or whatever that is. And you have it with a simple invisible with a workshop or whatever that is.

31:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right? Do you think this stuff is in that direction or I should bring it?

31:38 - Patrick Kizny
  No, this is all you need is like one headline and one stop header. So the amount of copy we're looking at in top left.

31:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

31:47 - Patrick Kizny
  That's all you need. That's all your mental state that you have available. Right? Good thing you have is. you are showing visual process, deliverables, or worksheets, or whatever that is because they are seeing the invisible.  It becomes visible. So that's great. But I'm not sure if I would do it on top of the website.  Next, perhaps next to this, or like you can play with the canvas dynamics and and put three things on above the fold section.  You could have the succinct copy as you have on top left. You could have some visual elements integrated somewhere in the layout or in the illustration.  And there should be your video pitch. I would love to see you, meet you, have a greeting from you, and have you introduce the problem and quickly deliver the solution.  Right. Keep it very casual, very personal. Show your face, be friendly. just deliver it nicely. And then on the bottom, what you need is the process.  How much does it cost? And what are the steps? Or actually the opposite direction. First, what are the steps?  What is the process? How quick and easy it is? Because you are selling a small product and quick process.  So you need to emphasize that it's quick and easy. It's simple, it's straightforward. And how much it costs. And then if you have any testimonials or references or success stories or cases, then present them.  And there are two approaches for this. My personal approach is that this stuff should be somewhere at the end to demonstrate or like reinforce that the credibility that there are people who actually purchase this and they are happy.  The SAS school and the growth hackers and all these social media gurus, they will tell you to put your credibility or social proof almost above the fold bar or just below above the fold on the first scrolling position.  So this is where you introduce the problem. I don't agree with this, especially in your case because people, you're already getting warm referrals.  This is not a website where people learn from Google, right? At least I believe that your face, well-delivered problem framing and well-delivered solution will give you much more credibility than showcasing the logos, because this sends a signal that you're trying to prove yourself too much.  But look, I'm not a guru. There are two different schools on that. You make your own decision. But I'm also explaining my thinking.

35:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. No, no, got it, got it, got it. I was checking out some Max trailers website.

35:36 - Patrick Kizny
  Max has a terrible website.

35:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but it's just it's really ugly.

35:42 - Patrick Kizny
  And it doesn't matter for him.

35:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and I think it kind of it's kind of on purpose. But it just does the video and the video even stutters a little bit.  I don't think it's all personas like like that. It's I'm not even sure if it's like on purpose. It seems that he is a little bit like that.  Because one-on-one conversations also comes across like that. So maybe he's just underselling himself, perhaps. don't know. But yeah, but I was wondering about this thing of just having a video.  Because I have to watch a demo, which would be that thing. But I see your point that maybe it even be right here, just below this stuff.  And just me explaining how I see things and what's the problem, how to fix it.

36:33 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, you could also design an above-the-fold section, which looks like the process, right? The sales process that we were discussing earlier, that there is awareness, interest, awareness.  Jesus. Unaware, aware, interested, interest, intent. And then big-ticket, sale, closing, whatever. Draw this process as a timeline. know where the workshops is, what this workshops facilitates, right?  Because what is your workshops? It's a tool in the sales process. It's definitely not for top of the funnel.  It's not for bringing awareness. It's not for raising interest. It's somewhere along around the lines of intent, right? So it's either confirming the intent or reassuring them or it's amplifying the value proposition, which by the way is a good value proposition for you as well.  Because thanks to this workshop you can upsell the client and sell much more, unlock the hidden revenue or whatever, sell higher to their offer, right?  That's your gateway to selling a high ticket offer, right?

37:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, and that's also how I look at it.

37:59 - Patrick Kizny
  Strategically what I do on, so you can use this visually because visually this will be great to it will make marketers and people who are familiar with the sales process it will make it will be clear for them where it sits and what it solves but strategically I think you you should dig around that and conceptualize or or what is your product actually doing and where does it sit in this interest intent award part of of sales pipeline because to me it's a little bit unclear I have so many angles that I can approach it from and I'm thinking aloud and like you know sharing these these ideas with you right now.

38:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah now I think this was very interesting because it makes It just makes sense on a kind of instinctive level, the intense stuff, which is, which is language that I have that marketing people understand.  And it just, you know, it cuts to the chase, which is great. I think one of the things that is made, first of all, I don't want to, you know, hog too much of your time, but I trust that you let me know when, you you got to go or Yeah, yeah.  You're a big boy. I know you would But what I'm thinking is So my hypothesis is, okay, so I do workshops.  Cool. But this is too generic. I need something a little bit more concrete to be a beachhead, because, you know, it's something to, to start to get make a name for myself in the market.  Cool. What kind of workshops are people more interested in? From my limited conversations, a lot of people seem to have the trouble with this, the thing that I've told you about, which is demonstrating their expertise with the workshop.  Demonstrating their expertise, my approach is to solve that with the workshop. They could solve it other ways, but that's mine.  If they are checking out this thing, they probably think that this makes some sense. Then, so far so good.  Then one of the things that has been a little bit difficult for me to wrangle and understand that this is a decision I need to make myself, that's very clear.  But one of the things that's been difficult for me to fix, is how to solve, is I think that I should have my own starter workshop, obviously.  In my page, I don't know exactly. where to put that because on one hand, I want to sell you wait, I'm updating my mental model based on what you told me.  Okay. Before this conversation that we had, and is on the fact that I want to sell to agencies, but I'm not selling to agencies right now.  When the work that I get is mostly like almost big to see, is like solos and stuff like that, which are a lot more sensitive.  There's also a lot more variability because it's just one guy, maybe they get distracted by other things. I don't want to sell to solos, basically.  To them, just sell something very.

41:44 - Patrick Kizny
  So don't do it? Yeah, yeah. Because the problem. Do it. Okay. At some point, I said you have two kinds of clients.  The first kind of clients are these which are convinced they want to throw money, get things done, and move over.  The second kind of clients is the kinds of clients that are tire kickers, poking holes and generally they are difficult clients and they have difficulty parting with money and they tend to throw time on things rather on problems rather than money.  And you will find plenty of people like that in solo printers, especially that like successful solo printers are not having this problem that they cannot deliver or show or make their expertise tangible.  So these are simply bad clients for you.

42:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. No, right now I'm not seeking these guys. If the conversation comes up, I'm like, okay, let's do it, but I'm not seeking them.  And which is a difficult thing for me to pay attention to because I am that guy. So it's much easier for me to get into those truths.  But this is a solvable problem. I can just, you know, keep reading on, keep reading, going into events, talking to people from the agency world and consulting firms and this is a solvable problem.  problem. Okay, so based on that, I used to think that 5k was not an entry level thing. Okay, you have convinced me that it is an entry level thing.  When I was thinking that 5k was not an entry level thing, I was thinking that I needed something smaller for an entry level thing.  Talking to you, I realized that maybe I don't need something smaller if I'm selling to agencies.

43:31 - Patrick Kizny
  This is already small enough.

43:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And given that, probably 5k, 4k, I would not call it that for clients, for the Taster Workshop.

43:48 - Patrick Kizny
  Design.

43:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's fine.

43:55 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, very cool.

44:02 - Patrick Kizny
  Ideally, you should deliver it even faster. Think about how can you save time?

44:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because these guys care more about time than money, especially at this level. One of the things I really don't want to do, because I like doing it and I spent too much time on it, is fiddling around with Miro for cool.  But this is just to give you context. I know how to address this.

44:29 - Patrick Kizny
  You should definitely... Okay, I see what you mean.

44:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You should do two things.

44:41 - Patrick Kizny
  And this is how you could also have two different offerings for two different kinds of clients. The 5K Taster Workshop design should be template-based, easy and repeatable.  So if you deliver Miro's, these are not customized. The only thing you do with the client is you spend a couple of hours with them on strategy, pull the  out of their head, put it in your template and call it a day.  That's what this product should look like. And also think about leading by doing, you know, showing not telling and leading by example, meaning what you do with them is your taste or workshop.

45:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's your taste or product.

45:31 - Patrick Kizny
  So this in your sales process, this should be only something that opens a door to a high ticket engagement where for this agency, you could design a custom, you know, workshop flow or sequence of workshops or like process mirror process boards or whatever that is, right, where you open up for customized work.  Problem solved,

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:02 - Patrick Kizny
  Also, yeah, I like that because that's that's also you're following into a trap hope like being a smart guy having a lot to offer, not having a market traction.  So you're trying to squeeze as much of your expertise into a first entry level product as possible. And that's a mistake.

46:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do not disagree. Can you can you rephrase? Because I think there's more than what I got.

46:29 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, let me catch that thought. Okay, you're a smart guy. You have a under your soul. You have a lot of expertise, and you have a genuine interest to help people and and and you need also the rewards for you is people taking your expertise.  That's your starting position. And the psychological motivation for you is to be appreciated for the great work and

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  in the world of your brain that you break.

47:02 - Patrick Kizny
  But business-wise, you're on a starting level, meaning you don't have a market traction, you don't have a product, you don't have a business yet.  So your temptation is to put everything you can offer into an entry-level product.

47:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

47:25 - Patrick Kizny
  So this is already solved. You just move this stuff to a future offering high on the ticket offer, and that's where your design customization, custom process design, or mirror boards, or processes design comes in.  So your first product is exactly what you're selling to them, which is what they sell to their clients. It's a taster workshop.  And for you, it's taster workshop design, but it's still a starter product. Think about it this way. I think, when we talk, I think you have one more problem to solve here.  You have this enumeration of people who are possibly using that. Consulting, coaching, advisory, and agency businesses. So let me process that.  A consulting business is maybe a firm like KPMG or what else?

48:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ernst and Young, McTinsey, right?

48:40 - Patrick Kizny
  These are consulting businesses.

48:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not for them, right?

48:44 - Patrick Kizny
  Coaches, think Tony Robbins or gym coaches or fitness coaches or whatever, right? What sort of coaches come in? Right?  It's too broad. The coaches is a huge bucket. There are coaches who would never need your product. are coaches who may want your product.  are coaches who are... Like, you need to figure out the cross-section. Advisory businesses. That's also a question who's sitting there.  And then you have agency businesses. Okay, agencies is another huge bucket. Is WPP going to buy workshops from you?  Probably not. Right? Like, global agencies with offices all around the world. Are they going to buy your taster workshops?  I don't think so. Right? So, I would think more about the context. Like, who is it? it? Who do you have in your mind specifically that may buy this product?  And if you're building on a backbone of like what max trailer teaches, I would go and dig the kinds of agencies he serves.  He works with agencies that are above $3 million revenue, typically. And I'm not sure exactly what sort of agencies he serves, because this is kind of vague to me.  I know that he serves businesses that already know that they have to transition from doing to thinking and incorporate consulting services somehow in their business and stop delivering strategy for free and start charging some small money for it.  Something like that. But I don't know specifically would need to dig around that. So that is you would like much more when you do this homework you will have a much more precise understanding of who is it for it doesn't have to be like you know separated by verticals you do you could you could think about writing this positioning statement or like qualification statement as you know it's it's workshop design for everyone who understands that they need to move on from from you know hands work to from selling hands to selling head or like from that that's one way the other way of phrasing that is and I would probably try to formulate this value proposition around this this second thinking which is a workshop  is a way to convince your client that you're the right shot, that you're the right fit, and amplify the budget or momentum and the budget that they are willing to spend with you or something like that.  It's like in logistics and delivery services, you have a problem which is called the last mile problem. You know that you're aware of that?  So you're solving something like the last mile, but like next to last mile, you see what I mean, right?  Yeah, it's a very specific part of the sales process. And if you try to frame it in the context of the sales process and think about, okay, who are these people?  Who are these people? Where they are in the sales process? What is it that it enables And what is it that it makes, like what problems in sales process it solves and what are the things that it accelerates, right?  Just expanding on this tiny dot on the timeline of sales, this will give you fuel to sell this author, think, because it's all there.  Again, to me, the value of this workshop is increasing sales momentum in a place where it's needed the most or something like that, because this is bridging the gap between interest and getting the  done, right?  So it's increasing momentum and it's also an opportunity for you, I mean for your clients, your clients to amplify the value, demonstrate that you are  worth every single penny that they are going to pay you and even 10 times more, right? So if you think about the transformation, before working with, I mean, speaking of your client applying this towards them, their client, right?  Before the workshop, the client is unsure whether it's a right fit.  And after the workshop, they are not only sure that it's a right fit, but they also got so much more value that they feel empowered and ensured that whatever happens next is well worth the money.
  POSITIVE REACTION:  Patrick explains workshop builds trust and value through expertise exposure - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/VuWNLeMYwoHKsZzcwj7HP9kqQycQt96Y?timestamp=3281.9
    That's the transformation, the way I read it. So like it solves lack of trust. It solves not invisibility, but being unfamiliar with the expertise or like tasting the expertise.


54:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

    It's tasting the expertise. That's all it is. Yeah.


55:01 - Patrick Kizny

    Right. And they are convinced that you're the right fit and it's worth every penny. That's all it is. And you have full value proposition and already you have marketing talking points, too, which you, by the way, should put as a part of your script or on your website as benefits that this workshop gives them.


55:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

    Come again. I'm not sure I followed.


55:26 - Patrick Kizny
  What I started doing is I nailed this part on the sales timeline. from there, I try to understand what is the transformation, what is the before, what is the after.

55:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And from there, I listed all the benefits for the client. Correct.

55:45 - Patrick Kizny
  And these benefits are already a talking points for you for the marketing. So they should be part of your script for the video.  And they should be repeated as a bullet points next to your value proposition, you know, workshop.

56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  offer or whatever that is Yeah, got it. No, this is great.

56:10 - Patrick Kizny
  This is really good So I would do it this way After all these exercises we've done Above the fold I I would use this space to introduce the context Like here's your typical sales process Here is where you need the biggest leap of faith This is why this is the most difficult part of the sales process And this is exactly why my offer tackles this It allows you to this this this and that Then have your have your video talking about You know just just a quick intro and and talking about this thing And then have a super succinct  definition of the product, meaning it's a taster of the expertise, a few bullet points of transformation, like what do their clients see before?  What do their clients see after? What are the outcomes? So the visual aspect of the workshop and my robots and stuff like that, I would move it down on the page, so that it's in the delivery levels.

57:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I wouldn't lead with this.

57:53 - Patrick Kizny
  You see what I mean? Because I believe that setting this context and showing them that this product solves the problem of bridging the gap of the leap of faith.  I think the leap of faith is the best term here, because every customer who will ultimately buy from you needs to make a leap of faith at some stage.  And the workshop is a great facilitator. It's like a stepping stone, right? You don't have to jump through an entire river, you have a stepping stone in the middle.

58:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's a very visual thing to illustrate.

58:33 - Patrick Kizny
  You can even design a visual around it. And this is much more important than the fact that there is a Myra board template, right?  This is so much more important than the Myra board template.

58:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. Also, my question was like, yeah, I get it that because I show the Myra boards, it kind of  people understand the deliverables but I also don't want to position myself as a Myroboard guy, right?

59:06 - Patrick Kizny
  You want or you don't want?

59:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do not want to be a Myroboard guy.

59:10 - Patrick Kizny
  Exactly.

59:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I was like yeah I mean this conveys what they get but maybe it's conveying that in a very you know low just implementation low value.

59:23 - Patrick Kizny
  Exactly, especially that if you show these pictures you're competing with templates and you know notion templates you can get for 100 bucks not for you don't need a human for that.  The same goes for Myroboards of course because you have templates for workshops for free or for 50 bucks whatever.

59:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. Oh that makes a lot of sense, that makes a lot of sense because this gives me something.  It gives me, I think, so I'll just kind of wrapping this up. Basically, I think what I'm missing besides like the obvious confidence aspect, we were working on that, but I think what I've missing was was that this decided understanding of how client thinks about this stuff, because I've had conversations that's probably not enough and deep enough, right?  And you come from this world and you were like, just nailing the language and the problems and the pain points really clearly.  And yeah, this is very coherent. I'm excited. I'm excited. Actually, I don't want to talk much more because there's very good stuff here and I'm afraid of getting sidetracked.

1:00:48 - Patrick Kizny
  No, I think this is cool. This was very good. I wish it was so easy for myself.

1:00:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I know what you mean, yeah, of course. Let me try to return the favor, so something you did that I think was very interesting in your process, and it's a simple question.  was like, ask me what do you need me to do here, because it would be very easy to just go into like dispensing advice mode, and maybe that's not the thing, so I think that was very smart on your side, and also this, like your intimate, like the way you think that you do the agency math, which is natural to you, I think that's also very valuable, and these are the things like, the whole thing was very good, okay, but these things really stick out to me in terms of like, maybe things you can, maybe that's the pack of flavor, you know?  Like, there's a way you have of approaching questions and trying to answer them and working with me on them, right?  Because we have spoken a few times, I mean, there's a certain consistency in, like, how do do this? There's your style.  So I've called it, like, the typical flavor, which is, like, your approach to this sort of this is kind of coaching, I think.  And the way you did that was, I think it was very productive. And it was not not too structured.  I didn't feel like square or like, oh, I have this specific method. But there was a logic behind it.  I could see that there's. You're not exactly shooting from the hip. But you're also dancing with the music, which comes with.  I guess like your dance thing, I think you, well, I'm talking too much, you fully understand what I'm talking, what I'm saying, so good.

1:03:11 - Patrick Kizny
  Cool man, now you have to trash your design and do it again.

1:03:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, fine.

1:03:21 - Patrick Kizny
  The one more idea is that, and I should perhaps start with this. mean, to some extent I started because I asked you at what stage of the pipeline sales pipeline are you using this website?  And what is it that you're selling, like how much it costs? And the kind of work that you're doing is sellable even without a website, right?  10 or 15 years ago you would need a website for this, but right now, know, things change. websites are the last thing that people want to look at.  So, I do. You can, you can think about it as a stuff. It's like, what is the good way of writing a novel?  You write your story in one sentence, and then you expand it to three sentences, and then you expand it to five and chapters, et cetera, et cetera, right?  Think about selling this author as on an appkin. Imagine you have an appkin and you have to sell it on an appkin, right?  That's all you need.

1:04:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a cool exercise.

1:04:30 - Patrick Kizny
  Simply because people are, look, it's a quick and easy project, quick and easy product. It's a low ticket offer.  And the way it's communicated should be in line with it. So it's not about talking more and designing this typical sales page, which you can scroll for 27 minutes.  We all know this, right? Yeah, you could sell it. through a link in the bio page generator or whatever that is, right?

1:05:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Link three or whatever it is, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. So I think, to be honest, I think the exercise of you know, coming up with this was a Trojan horse, even to myself, and I'm aware of that, like, yeah, I'm forced to make some decisions on things, and yeah, that sharpens my thinking, right?  But I agree with you. I agree with you that the artifact of the website is not necessary, but the act of thinking about this stuff is really important.

1:05:42 - Patrick Kizny
  That's right.

1:05:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I agree, I agree. I think, yeah, just, yeah, link in and link three is maybe YouTube. It's probably more than enough.  And maybe at the end, I'll just scrap this and just redirect the website to my LinkedIn and my YouTube.

1:06:00 - Patrick Kizny
  think you need is like one good illustration and a five minute video.

1:06:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm good at illustrations and timing and it's done. I have a last question and I don't want to take too much of your time.  I'm thinking I'm thinking of like the visual style of this because this is a bigger question. So just give me like a direction and let me go explore.  But I'm thinking like how premium should I try to make it look? Because it doesn't look premium right now.  It just looks like, you know, it is what it is. And I don't want to be like fashion premium, that kind of premium.  Just like confidence premium, you know? And yeah, what does this style convey to you?

1:06:49 - Patrick Kizny
  Basically, that's it.

1:06:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's my question to you.

1:06:52 - Patrick Kizny
  It conveys, I mean, what you have currently on our website is crap. And the reason for that So I perfectly understand where it comes from.  So historically, it's a template which is coming from the SaaS world. But SaaS world was very technical and at some point arrived at the style which is let's try to humanize our tech.  instead of doing the square and corporate graphics, let's try to be a little bit more crayon-ish and playful. That's how SaaS started looking crappy.  So it's like there is this platform for creatives to sell their . What is the name? She's a country member.  Where you can sell easily digital products, PDFs, artists, leftovers and stuff like that.

1:07:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It has this very playful, similar style. Oh, Gumroad?

1:07:47 - Patrick Kizny
  Gumroad, yeah. So it's this vibe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Currently on your website. Frankly, it's. I'm missing a word, say it in Polish and maybe I'll get it from you.  I'm missing it in Polish. It's like making good stuff look childish. Not for no reason. You don't want it to look corporate, but you don't want to look childish, right?  So the design challenge for you would be to find a clean casual style, right? Or like if you think in fashion terms, smart casual.

1:08:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:08:40 - Patrick Kizny
  That's the way to go. But at the same time, there is one thing that you have about your design, which I think you have on Snapchat and in your posts on LinkedIn, which I'm seeing from time to time, which are like casual based on a desk or something.  like that where you have this cutting mat or something like that and there is something good in your way of in your design that reflects the way you're thinking so like you have your visual identity which is very in line with who you are and to me you're a person who is very good at structural thinking and so this is my world yeah you're the structure guy yeah okay this is messy but you're the structure guy right and your visuals on sub-stack the way they are always they are never linear they are always canvas based you're a canvas thinker so you have it on stacks sub-stack but you don't have it on your website on your website i know you tried to incorporate it to some extent but it was made cryo nation cheap on sub-stack you have a bold and minimal style so  Think about this visual language for yourself. Think about making it structural. That could be one thing. People like structure.  Structure makes people feel safe.

1:10:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I really like that 1950s official mass documentation sort of thing, you know?

1:10:21 - Patrick Kizny
  Not drawing a bell for me. would need to look at it. Anyway, second more casual way to twist it, and you can either change the direction to that or merge these two, yes, flip the camera, take a good picture of your desk or design something like that, and use this desk and your work place as a canvas to sell your product.  You see what I mean? I mean, take a shot of your laptop, of your notebooks, cards, and all the things that you have like these sticky notes and all these stuff.  And think about designing this author in your room on the desk, right? That's what I meant by a napkin sketch, right?  Essentially what could be a good statement website is that you actually make this offer on a napkin and then you photograph it or maybe retouch it a bit in Photoshop and then it put it on your website and make it a website, right?

1:11:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:11:29 - Patrick Kizny
  And then a statement also.

1:11:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, there's something I want to do on that, especially with the video, like camera overhead, disappointing stuff, you know.

1:11:44 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, because that's you.

1:11:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:11:48 - Patrick Kizny
  But also use your, like, use your face. Go there, talk to these people. Because that's your website. address, they will be working with you.  And that's what they are buying. And you're a cool guy.

1:12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

1:12:10 - Patrick Kizny
  You could even do a walking video, like when when you have your script or like the flow of the video.  By the way, it shouldn't be scripted. You should you should nail your pitch so that you can do it casually.  And then what you could do is your video could be could start when you casually walk through the park or whatever that is.  It's it's a walking video. So you keep filming yourself walking. And then you maybe enter the staircase and maybe you enter in your room and sit on from your desk and and like, know, take the video and maybe cut to it or like rotate your phone and show the stuff on your desk and start sketching or like, you know, transition to a to a to this napkin sketch stuff like that.  Right? So like, you start casual out and you bring them into your space as they get to know you you know what i want to do now i want to get a gopro i have a gopro i just yeah emerge from the sea and then i draw it on the sand oh yeah that's a great idea first hand yeah i need to go to the beach well you're talking to a okay uh this was very good if i can leave you with some homework the kind of work that i do and i would love to do and my approach is exactly as i work with you right now and i can do it with like almost everybody on any subject which relates to anything creative sales film marketing whatever right the question is how to package it and how to make people want to get this  from me

1:14:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't understand. What is the homework? What is the task?

1:14:07 - Patrick Kizny
  Think about it. Think about how should I do it?

1:14:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I turn it back to you.

1:14:13 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

1:14:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:14:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. If you have thoughts on this, right? I do. Because the whole body method and all this crap, you know, this is something that came to my mind.  I've done it. But, you know, my way of working is this, the Paco style, which, if you can also put in some bullet points, like, think about what is special?  What is this method? what is it that is so unique about the way I work? That would be helpful to me.  But the problem I have to solve is, like, how to get people come to me for the kind of work, like I'm doing with you or with Rob or colleagues or whoever.

1:14:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I share something?

1:14:55 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

1:14:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this deserves a larger conversation. And maybe that that's like both a personality thing and also a culture thing because my culture is very sensitive and like trying to get the right tone and that kind of thing.  When I first found you on LinkedIn, I was intrigued because this was like three, four months ago because you came across as knowing your stuff but a little bit arrogant and I was like, okay, I know nothing so I need to learn from this guy and I'm open to this but I could see how because you're much more friendly on these conversations even if you're not like teddy bear, right?  But on the first post that I saw a written post, I felt a certain snarkiness and maybe I have it too, I don't know that I was like, huh, I was it was impossible to avoid to ignore that is for sure but I think that maybe some people feel a bit insecure.  about that because I remember feeling like that I have I have it on my notes when we spoke the first time that you even noticed that I was kind of um fidgeting and I think I was nervous to talk to you and now I'm I'm still a little bit but that's because of I know so little and you know so much but much better and I think that there's something there like in the first uh first contact with the pack of stuff so it was repelling to you it was not repelling because you knew so much and you you the confidence was like okay so this guy knows something but at the same time I remember it was a little bit of a leap of faith it's not the right word but it was a little bit like I'm not sure if I'm going to like this guy but I know that he knows stuff and I want to know about this stuff I think that was a thing and this is just one data point because yeah knowing you you still have this very straight shooter kind  thing. But it's not like clueless. You always have ways of exploring that. So anyway, try to figure out if more people see these or just me, because I'm kind of a...

1:17:14 - Patrick Kizny
  I guess it could be true that I'm coming across as arrogant, especially if you take it from the American culture.

1:17:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:17:24 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. Not to even mention Canadians. But if there is anything... Well, the problem is like, okay, not to come across as arrogant, but not to be ignorably polite.

1:17:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:17:46 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm not making it up like this is who I am. Right? Yeah. often, often I'm black. Often I'm probably arrogant.  Or people, you know, get it. question is, is it good or bad? Because anyway, my problem is that I'm drowning in  in and in noise in social media.

1:18:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're drowning in noise in noise and  in social media. I'm not capping through. Yeah. Yeah. I think the thing you do.  So now from the other angle that thing that used to do of making videos like in big metals and grass, that really stood out.  I remember I started following you because you were talking about the future in space and stuff like that. And then you show up on these pictures and these settings like really nature style.

1:18:44 - Patrick Kizny
  Mm-hmm.

1:18:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is there a raccoon?

1:18:47 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

1:18:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That was nice. How do you know that? No, because I saw the pictures on LinkedIn. Oh, what's his name?

1:19:00 - Patrick Kizny
  This will be Bishop. Oh, no, maybe it's Chopin. She's too small. But she's got pantalons, so I think... No, it's a young one.  Because we have five of them and there are two guys that are parents and she's for sure female. But I guess that's a young one.

1:19:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What was I saying?

1:19:42 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, this kind of stuff.

1:19:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  were saying the future and the metal. Yeah, yeah. This makes me feel like you are future aware, clearly. You know, you think about the future.  You're interesting. So you're not just some hippie guy that likes nature, but you also understand where the world is.  working and you have enough moving and you have an opinion on things and you see but these two things I think they're relatively in common and that they are intriguing at least to me and I think they are natural to you like when you post like ah I just I just went out and picked mushrooms that's something that you know people just cannot do because they don't live where you live they don't know what you do and have them and that was very refreshing I think which is the same thing you're telling me just to clean into who you are because you are not a vanilla guy so if you were a vanilla guy I mean yeah find a personality first and then talk about it but you're not vanilla guys so yeah you have that thing so yeah hmm and he said that I was posting them a long time ago so you're not seeing much of that vibe from me

1:21:00 - Patrick Kizny
  anymore? In general?

1:21:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think the last thing I saw from you was from Rob, straightinho. And which was good as well.  mean, the guy also, I think the people we talked to convey something about yourself, I knew about Rob, so that's good.  But yeah, because I remember that was like maybe a couple of weeks. There was a period of time I remember this, that you were like in a hammock, I think, and stuff like that.  And I was like, I'm not sure what this guy is doing, because I was following you with all of this stuff.  But this is different. Yeah, I was intrigued. Even that shirt you had with the crisscross thing, which feels a little bit like medieval Europe sort of thing.  And I was like, okay, this is not a guy with a black t-shirt and a silver

1:22:00 - Patrick Kizny
  chain or something gotcha okay and recently I started posting the stuff in colorful frames so like usually these were like casual photographs around the house and with me and there were these like visual red or green frames and a bit of copy on that my design this style a few weeks back and for about a week I was posting these and then I this yeah this is the reiteration of that same design but that was not with Titanic but with my pictures like me though you know okay okay this thing this thing this is how I put the interviews right now so the frame is here but scroll down  Like a lot, this was probably a couple weeks back,  Gordon Ramsay, my best performing post. Go down. Oh yeah, this stuff.

1:23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Here?

1:23:17 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, scroll down, I guess scroll down. Yeah, this one, the green one that you had. Now, this is my body.  I'm not sure which direction you're scrolling, because it's choppy, but you had a couple of them on the screen.  I think you need to show the stuff that is coming later. So you scroll too early, too far back.  Oh yeah, this one. Stuff like this one, so I designed and posted a lot of these. don't work harder, it's a little smarter, category design is a scam.  Yeah, you're seeing this. How do you, how do these talk to you? How does this have come across?

1:24:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the copy is a little bit in your face, but in a way that it tells me that I'm missing something, but it's not immediately clear what I should do with that, right?  So, like, your business screwing you or the other way around, I suppose?

1:24:45 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, if you see blanks, you should fill them, right?

1:24:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming that that's what you mean. Yeah, because I think this, provocation, it's very easy to agree to.  It's a very, it's very like, okay, yeah, yeah, this is an important thing. But I don't know if I'm good at, you know, I can just give you my perspective, of course.  So this is my perspective. I was, it's like, obvious thing to say yes to, to agree with, to say, okay, this makes sense.  But then it doesn't convey, at least in the image, like how you think about things. It conveys a certain Maverick aspect, like, you are not interested in just, you know, talking about what people are talking, or just pretending that everything is okay, and positive thinking, stuff like that.  But at the same time, I think there's missing the, the, like everything. So this stuff is a scam for  this is one. This one is a scam. Okay. So what is true? I understand that it's here, like you probably addressed this, right?  But, but in this image, I think maybe the image is too final, maybe even the, the, the punctuation stresses this.  Because you have more nuance than this. But the way it is written, it feels like you're just, you know, screaming at the wrong things is in the world, you know?  But they're like, when I talk to you, you have much more nuance than this. You're, you're thinking is much more sophisticated than this post image tells me.

1:26:39 - Patrick Kizny
  this is a cover, right?

1:26:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Understand, I understand.

1:26:43 - Patrick Kizny
  this, this, this cover, I think didn't make me want to see why do you think that's a scam? And the other one?

1:26:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one?

1:26:54 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

1:26:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Kind of the same thing. It's, it's like, it doesn't do I think what's missing perhaps in the image is something to make me believe that if I click on read more, I'll get like an answer.  So a stupid example, one of those like bad annoying LinkedIn things. It's okay. is your business screwing you or the other way around.  And now the silly example is like, see how I make sure my business is my . Something like this.  Okay. This is silly example. But there's an interruption, the pattern interruption, right? What they talk about. So you did that.  You interrupted the pattern of just scrolling. But then you need to bring me into the way you have the nuance, which is in the text, think.

1:27:44 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, that's interesting. Yeah. Gotcha. Right. Ironically, red scam post is the best performing one, unfortunately. This is the only one that performed out of all these.

1:28:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, do you think this is dead?

1:28:10 - Patrick Kizny
  But anyways, my question was more over because you brought the fact that I'm in the nature and I have the hammock and the meadow and all this stuff.  And then, you know, I did this series and there is probably a few more posts somewhere in the neighborhood along these lines.  So do they have a similar feeling to you?

1:28:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good point. This color, for me, is high-tech sports gear, you know, stuff like that, robots. And then you are in nature, and which is like the interesting aspect, like you.  You are like you are interested, like the phone to use, you like technology, like cyber stuff, don't know, but then you are in nature, right?  And I don't know if at this moment they talk to one another because this is really strong, like it's square, it's thick lines, the font is really futuristic.  This is really strong on that side, but then the black and white takes away the nature aspect.

1:29:22 - Patrick Kizny
  know what I mean?

1:29:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe you are a solar punk, do you know solar punks?

1:29:28 - Patrick Kizny
  No. Okay, but hold on, but that means it's good because I'm the future guy and I'm still in the middle of nature.  I agree that nature is maybe less pronounced if it's colorful. I do have some layouts which are colorful also, but they become too vanilla, unfortunately.  So I decided to go for black and white. But it's good because you also probably you have the what the  moment, right?  Because you have to contrast the things and it makes you start thinking, okay, what is it, right? Is it nature or is it...

1:30:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  analogy or uh-huh uh-huh uh yeah the contrasting it's important I agree I think and maybe it is also to do with like the current season in Europe the this is an example I mean we don't need to go too much on this but the black and white uh leans it too much towards this thing I think and then it feels more futuristic I don't know I don't I don't think I'm a good judge of this step but so I can only give you my my personal that's all I'm asking for so you're not a big fan of all these with red and green green friends I don't like the green okay but there were some which are red I have a palette colors where green is the dominant but I also have red yes and I have blue and yellow I didn't use much of them but green is the dominant one  For some reason, I'm trying to think of a reason. I don't like the red. I like boxes. So like my stuff sometimes adds boxes.  I like boxes and like this kind of squarish structure and grids. I like that. So my thing is not the box.

1:31:28 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, for me, my primary motivation compared to the stuff I was posting earlier is stand the  out on the timeline because people are ignoring you because there is no single visual element that stands out.  And I believe that this frame makes it stand out on the timeline. If you keep scrolling, it's impossible not to.

1:31:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. No, this yellow absolutely. In that sense, it works really well. I see this and I know it's ours, for sure.

1:31:57 - Patrick Kizny
  And that's all I need from this.

1:32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So keep doing that for sure.

1:32:03 - Patrick Kizny
  And then I have continuity in the past, in the stuff I'm posting with people, right? Because as much as I can, I'm introducing this in the podcast stuff that I'm sharing.

1:32:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, in that sense, using that because that's yours, absolutely. I also, did you put these names here underneath? I think that works.

1:32:36 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, this one I edited manually, but all these software that I'm using for, for editing this is just a huge headache because, you know, each of them doesn't work in its way.

1:32:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it's so frustrating.

1:32:50 - Patrick Kizny
  Like right now I had to switch to Riverside and doing anything more sophisticated than running late in the Riverside is just impossible.  But I can't spend a day editing a podcast that took an hour to record.

1:33:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just too much. This was great. Okay. This was great. So this is you in nature. There's something that nobody else could do.

1:33:17 - Patrick Kizny
  Very nice. Well, but it didn't work, man.

1:33:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because I mean, I'm just nothing happened.

1:33:24 - Patrick Kizny
  Three likes, zero comments, no traction.

1:33:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is first time I see this. I'm going to like it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, maybe it is throttling your reach.

1:33:38 - Patrick Kizny
  Of course it is. Everyone.

1:33:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Why?

1:33:41 - Patrick Kizny
  Why not?

1:33:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't know. Because it's funny.

1:33:46 - Patrick Kizny
  Show me show me your stats out of Rio City.

1:33:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:33:50 - Patrick Kizny
  How many followers do you have? 3000. You're smaller than myself.

1:33:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How many connections do you have? Connections, like

1:34:00 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm interested in the ratio of followers to, okay, so you have two and a five thousand connections and probably five hundred followers.  So a bit smaller than my account but similar.

1:34:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Where did I check the numbers?

1:34:15 - Patrick Kizny
  It's supposed to be, right? Yeah. No, you have to click your, , it looks different. You have to click your profile.  Yeah. Yeah. And then you're not seeing your stats. Oh, here, here, here, right? Okay, show me analytics.

1:34:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Any specific thing you want to see?

1:34:46 - Patrick Kizny
  Not just this one. And change it to last 28 days. Okay. So you get 1500. No, you have to I don't think it's click show results.  This is a broken UI Yeah, even still didn't This is broken This is interesting Show me the peaks. What are the peaks?  Okay, so you're posting probably once a week or something like that Well, yeah, kind of like that So these are your posts Probably, yeah Yeah, that is like Wednesday Wednesday Tuesday So Like visuals didn't get much But this was good stuff Like the idea with blanks and uncovering and hiding things These are things that work well Well, I thought so but

1:36:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  didn't get a single subscription for that post.

1:36:02 - Patrick Kizny
  No, keep doing this, because this is one of these like low level hacks that to me, this is something that makes sense and really taps into like it hijacks you on a very low level.  But at the same time, this is not something that screams I'm a growth hacker marketing bro bullshitter, right? It's a sophisticated hijacking.  So keep doing that. this is wonderful.

1:36:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

1:36:38 - Patrick Kizny
  That's why I started using blacks.

1:36:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly. Yeah, yeah. I think blurring is better than blank. Because learning conveys that there is the right answer blank conveys that, you know, it could be many.

1:36:53 - Patrick Kizny
  My intention was to break through the image and perception of a smart guy who came to illuminate everybody with himself being smart and invite conversation or at least thinking, right?  Because your posts are getting, look, this is mind-blowing, we have very different dynamics. Your best post has 1,200 impressions.  Is it coming from, yeah, this is one week old. And you have 20 comments or 20 likes, right? You have 20 likes and 4 comments.  So that should be a very well-performing post, like it should have much more attraction. So what was interesting to me is that my posts are getting a little bit more visibility compared to yourself, but I'm getting zero engagement.  Like I'm getting views, but I'm not getting an engagement. People don't interact with my posts at all.

1:38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I first this one, think because I tagged Sean and it was I mean, I'm not dumb, but this was not done just to make him like it.  It's sincere. I like his stuff. And I think I started getting likes from people that I've never seen because I think he liked it and then like this guy liked it and so on.

1:38:24 - Patrick Kizny
  That's the way it's supposed to work.

1:38:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like my best performing post ever. I think it was and that was was a little bit more thought through.  It was what a post where I talk about flash PMM. Okay, so this post does a few things first, these guys were kind of getting famous on LinkedIn.  And then I hit I put this thing behind on purpose to make it make it recognize but not, you know,  This is real. I always talk about Flash PMM. It's kind of a big card for me at this point.  Seven months ago. And then I tried to unpack what they do, which was usual growth approach to stuff. I tagged them.  And then I started. Yeah, I asked people, there's a little bit of an Easter egg in the thing like I tried to make fun surround around the name.  And then I just call them what's the shadows was for cheetos stuff like this.

1:39:29 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay.

1:39:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I index the thing the way they do it.

1:39:33 - Patrick Kizny
  They also do it. They use these colors.

1:39:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this was the regular language. And and I always try to have these like say what they do. And synthesize that.  Oh, they do visual frameworks. And they make it that that's very shareable. We like to look smart. So we share stuff, you know.  And but I could never replicate this also because the formula for this is clearly based around tagging them. oh, and there's another thing.  They are known for interacting with posts that mention them, which is very smart on their side, because then people have incentive for making posts.

1:40:15 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, and I didn't interact, nobody tags me. Okay, so you have 5,000 impressions all together.

1:40:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This was the best one ever, right? Oh, , man.

1:40:27 - Patrick Kizny
  So I shouldn't be probably complaining, because my entire life is being so frustrated with social media not working for me.  But, well, you're the second person I'm seeing that doesn't moan and complain about it, even with, like, so much smaller.  But anyways, are you getting inbound inquiries from my team?

1:40:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not that many.

1:40:51 - Patrick Kizny
  mean, enough to be busy. Have you ever got one?

1:40:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. uh i'm i'm currently working on two things that came through linkedin the first one was i don't know if i can count it as an inquiry i just found somebody that was interesting and i said man i want to talk to you because a little bit like you and i and we kept talking for months eventually some work came out of it but yeah the other one was i posted something on linkedin and there's a guy that is in a community that i used to be in so it's kind of in the same vibe and it's like oh my god i need this and then that was very typical because that guy i was like i could see the notifications like you're liking my posts signing up on my newsletter finding an email sending me sending me an email he moved really fast and but that's not my typical experience so right now the work i'm doing i think yeah maybe a third or a fourth comes from linkedin but basically just if i get it straight my numbers are bad that that's what you're saying

1:42:00 - Patrick Kizny
  No, they are much smaller than my numbers, but you're not complaining. And you have very high engagement. Like what I meant was that given the how high engagement you have, because I'm seeing what I'm seeing when I'm seeing your post is that people like it, people comment, will interact.  That's what I'm seeing, right?

1:42:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:42:21 - Patrick Kizny
  And now that you show me your impressions, I think that this is interesting to me, that these are so low amount of impressions compared to the amount of engagement you're getting.  That's what I mean.

1:42:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. Yeah, but I think it's the other way around actually. It's getting a lot of engagement for not a lot of impressions.  I mean, it's still annoying that impressions are low, for sure.

1:42:53 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, I'm super happy to share my screen and show you what it looks like.

1:43:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  my site. I'll stop sharing and I'll take that. But I'll need sorry I'll need to move the places I need to move from this computer because somebody will need to use the room.
  SCREEN SHARING: Patrick started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/VuWNLeMYwoHKsZzcwj7HP9kqQycQt96Y?timestamp=6224.972381  While you figure out your screen I'll just move around okay I'll take my camera for a second. you

1:44:08 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, so let me know when you're back. And if you see my screen.

1:44:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear me?

1:44:20 - Patrick Kizny
  Yes, I can hear you. I don't see you.

1:44:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, welcome back.

1:44:30 - Patrick Kizny
  See my screen?

1:44:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I see your screen.

1:44:33 - Patrick Kizny
  Cool. So I'm recently complaining about not being able to cross 4,000 impressions week. So my monthly is 17,000. My account is not much bigger than yours because yours is 3,000 and I have 4,000.  So it's just 30% bigger. So looking at the impressions, I have much more, but it used to be so much more, right?  I'm not beating I'm not beating 4,000 a week this week is unusual. I don't know why it's 5,000 Well, the Friday post was well timed Braclunds on Friday casual stuff on Friday.  That's something that works a Videos I'm having very very low engagement and very very impressions on videos and If you look at my best performing pose across the last 28 days, this is the most frustrating part Okay controversy.  So like if you call something a scam This this is good results But anyway this is 2000 impressions so that's not really a lot.  It's been a very bad month on LinkedIn. Yeah then this Friday post for  and then typically the stuff that is getting a lot of traction is when I share someone who posts some crap like this post for example let AI Gordon Ramsey cook and this is some stupid video everybody expects that the fish will eat Gordon Ramsey or alive or whatever but I use this post in order to well event right or to criticize something most of AI software be like AI Gordon Ramsey cook just saying right so what's frustrating to me is that this kind of posts are getting much more traction than whatever smart thing I write.  And then, okay, this post got some traction because Rob shared it. This one got actually much more because it was thanking to Alex and he liked something.  This is something I can share with you using GIFs and moving stuff. I think it's a great way to attract eyeballs for two reasons.  First of all, I'm not sure how is it in your timeline, but I have to click play on every video so that it starts playing.  I have it on purpose. I don't know if it's out of place for you. But if you upload an animated GIF, there is no way it doesn't move.  It keeps moving. Choosing stuff that moves is the most important thing. different instincts. If there is a lot of motion and movement, that works.  So this is a good thing, but also this post with this loop is great because when I have it, when I go to my profile, I have it featured here.  And this is a huge standout, right? Because people typically have these posts here which are pinned. On a desktop, you have more of them.  On a mobile, you see only one of them. But if stuff moves here, I think that's a huge win.  So anyways, looking at my posts, to share the stats with you. Okay, this one, creative industries dying. I don't know, it was done for something else, not for LinkedIn.  272 impressions. The usual crap. This one, I don't know why it doesn't even have stats, this is weird. Yeah, 200, 300, this is usual, 400.  This was like a mini viral or like a little bit of traction on the raccoons. Yeah, this is typical video post that I'm sharing 200 impressions and they tank zero likes, zero comments, maybe occasionally something.  So generally these videos are not getting any interest and I posted a lot of that. This, interestingly, this post about the raccoon, I'm not sure if the version that I posted here is with my viral results at the end.  No, this is an edited shorter version. Anyways, when I posted this raccoon without the client with the budget labels, just the raccoon.  With me shouting on the raccoon. I mean shouting talking to a raccoon. She posted it on Facebook and it got 1.3 million or 1.5 million overnight.  So I thought  it's no brainer. Let's let's turn it into a meme for business and like put it here and it died.  300 nothing And of course sharing a leak will kill you rich So I'm dealing with this reality that I'm posting like seven days a week and Nothing really works now I got two virals The entire history  I'm not sure if you saw this one. AI is a scam.

1:51:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you seen this?

1:51:23 - Patrick Kizny
  So this one got 73,500 likes, 150 comments. Insane. But the issue with this is that I cannot repeat it because it's not significantly better than on my other posts.  It didn't convert into any interest or sustained reach or it didn't elevate other posts. It didn't give me any traction that's followed.  It's like a random win on a lottery that doesn't really elevate you. Tiktok is different because Aga she's on tiktok and when she hits a viral on tiktok a lot of her posts are going out And so you can finally get some traction there, but it didn't really work and the other one I did which was viral was something with Elon Musk Saying that the mask was stupid and we're okay And that was more than a year ago you're in a health and it was similar numbers Even maybe even bigger like one hundred fifty thousand or something like that But anyways interestingly I reposted an edited version of that post or like try to repeat the same success and the other day I did it was only like 15,000 so Didn't really work so a lot of that is luck and That's just not to repeat it.  Oh Well, yeah, that's me.

1:52:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think we need a  and

1:53:00 - Patrick Kizny
  That's a big conclusion.

1:53:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Basically, that's it. No, it's a touch-on network run by morons and... For morons.

1:53:09 - Patrick Kizny
  Buy morons for morons.

1:53:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  More edits, LinkedIn. And I mean, who wants to work at LinkedIn? Only like the most corporate of corporate people.  I mean, there's no imagination in that place. imagine the kind of decisions they make. And so there's that, which is  frustrating.  What has helped me, I think, was... I'm still getting work. And I think that's... I think there's a couple of differences between us.  So first one is that I have lower standards, right? You used to run businesses. And you probably have like an awareness of how much business you could be bringing in that is different from mine.  still at that stage that I'll get, oh my god, people with my , which is not a good place to be.  I don't think it's smart or good for me in that place, but I think, yeah, it produces less, I don't know, anxiety, I suppose.  So that's one thing. The other thing is, so I still get this work from other sources, and that kind of keeps me busy enough.  And having these sort of conversations, because I crave so much external validation, usually addresses that. So I talk to people, I usually enter the conversations like, oh my god, this person wants to talk to me.  And then at some point I'm like, oh, apparently I was useful. So I think we have different personalities around this, and that's why also I'm not so angry at LinkedIn right now.  But I think it's just because I'm playing on the little league, and you are trying to these are in our professional sustainable way.  yeah, I understand your disagreements. But yeah.

1:55:09 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, but well, it's bringing you leads. It's not bringing leads to me.

1:55:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, I did some math, I got like two things from LinkedIn on months. I got like two jobs from LinkedIn.  Most of the stuff I get is still from like best clients.

1:55:25 - Patrick Kizny
  Right. Well, Alex claim he's getting a lot of leads from LinkedIn.

1:55:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Alex is very good at copywriting. And I think LinkedIn is a copywriting place, a bit like Twitter. And I think, I think that's what it does really well.  And it's so subtle copywriting. So I took that course like the unignorable, right?

1:55:53 - Patrick Kizny
  a lot of unignorable is a challenge.

1:55:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So like in a course or a challenge from Alex no no no no it's from uh what's her name let me find it the point is there's a lot of things that they talk about there that i think you will not like okay it's because it's growth hacky copy and stuff like that but it's relatively sincere okay so this is not a bunch of 22 year olds pretend to live in miami and and have lambos yet teaching your copyright to drop ship is not that but they give you a few they give you so much tips that if only a percentage of them lands you still get some impact from that which is why i think even with low reach i get some engagement because i think i've absorbed some some of the lessons they gave me i didn't finish the course and that's on me that's a problem i i have but most of the lessons were like  Okay, this and also like paying attention out how they do it the thing you told me about me running a workshop for Taster Like it's interesting to see like what the game and they are playing, right?  so We talk a lot about hooks, you know that click baity stuff and There's levels to it, right? Some people are really strong on the click baity stuff and they get really viral results Some others just don't go all the way there, which I think I don't But still you are aware of it is to help you And I see that you also do this in your post, but I think Alex had that thing That is very yes very good at you know writing and LinkedIn because of the common system Is a good place for that whereas Instagram is not You

1:58:03 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm negotiating with the right film.

1:58:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:58:08 - Patrick Kizny
  Because he wants to sneak in.

1:58:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, because it's warm, no? Well, I guess there is more food in the kitchen. I didn't.

1:58:26 - Patrick Kizny
  I didn't. Come on. Hello. We'll right here.

1:59:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just give him a cigarette.

1:59:32 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm frustrated because I'm not caping through, like it's not converting from me into rich into leads into anything and I just cannot cap through and at the same time I'm seeing all the crap that is getting you know hundreds of thousands that LinkedIn is pushing into people so there's that thing you told me about that when I had to start of my conversation I said oh these guys have a lot of followers that they're probably making a lot of money and you're like wait might not be like  it.

2:00:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but I mean, yeah. But Twitter might be coming up again.

2:00:07 - Patrick Kizny
  So I don't know. Coming up again Twitter, what do you mean by that?

2:00:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Here in Brazil, Twitter was banned for a while.

2:00:15 - Patrick Kizny
  Oh, banned.

2:00:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah. And then it's coming back. And so this is a Brazilian context thing. Maybe maybe maybe you're a Twitter kind of guy.  I don't know. What's me.

2:00:29 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. No, man, this doesn't work at all. I mean, I tried posting some stuff on Twitter, but it never worked.  I mean, I used to use Twitter 15 years ago, or something like that. I had 5000 followers. But recently, when I got back to social media, I started posting something and my posts were getting like 20 impressions.  Nothing happened. So I just doing this.

2:00:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because I don't know.

2:00:59 - Patrick Kizny
  I think Twitter Twitter is great. If you want to look for some , like the only thing that is great on Twitter is .

2:01:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, that's not true.

2:01:12 - Patrick Kizny
  Why do you say so?

2:01:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe that is true again. Like, I haven't used Twitter for a few months. What I really liked about Twitter is that it was a place where you could have deep conversations.  When? You need to follow interesting people, not brands. I don't know man. I've had really interesting stuff there. I've learned a lot there.  And it's something that people get surprised when I say this. I think what I like about Twitter is that you can just ignore all the things they tell you.  They suggest you follow at the start. And then you go find the nerdiest, most autistic guys you can find on some aspects.  and start following those guys. And then it gets really interesting because they have their own autistic friends and you get people really discussing like the fringe of things.  So I love that. And I'm sad that Peter changed a little bit and now I can use it that way anymore.  Maybe that's what happened in the meanwhile.

2:02:25 - Patrick Kizny
  Maybe now Peter is in the booth. Well, 15 years ago it was cool but I used it in my filmmaking days and there was a lot of stuff happening there.  I agree. But that was many, many years ago. right now it's like all I'm seeing on Twitter is violence, Trump, Elon Musk pushing  at me and .  That's the only stuff that I'm seeing.

2:02:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know.

2:02:50 - Patrick Kizny
  One out of four is not bad. If you compare it to LinkedIn or LinkedIn you're getting ugly crap. No .

2:03:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  better. This is a post that I think will have some reach if you make a reach of making my case that Twitter is better than LinkedIn and you use this method.  I'll do that. do It just put a graph like days since last time I saw  on Twitter, zero, LinkedIn.  4,000 days. This is my point. Anyway, yeah, these . I was listening to one of those podcasts from Debussy Baker and one of things that he said that was really interesting to me, and it makes a lot of sense, was that sometimes creating your audience is so much work.  It's better to just hop in on somebody else's audience. And he was talking about how we sold so many books to increase those audience.

2:03:51 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, everybody did. Yeah, guys that are consulting in my space, the only reason they do it successfully until today is because in

2:04:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  2018, they went on Chris Dawes podcast. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, the best way the best to plant a tree was four years ago, that sort of thing.  But but the thing is that maybe there are other audiences that like, for instance, I haven't found this yet for myself.  To be honest, I think it's a little bit of lack of focus because I've, you know, things happening in a, I have many directions to explore.  But I think there's something to be done. Like my wife, she's a consultant as well. She has her own company.  And her thing is she is she has a fresh approach to things, workshops and stuff for not workshop themes.  It works in corporate compliance, which is a little bit boring, but she doesn't make it boring. And she has realized that their best clients for her are like these companies that are not hip.  They're not cool. And then she comes across as cool and really modern and so on and and maybe there's something something there like maybe it's not agencies or but agency agent agents agents since because Chris Doe and that crowd they they have quite they have a lot of gravitational pull right but maybe there are communities of people within problems to solve that they they need to fill in like their own events and they need to fill in their own like newsletters they need content you know mm-hmm so maybe there's something there I don't know what it what it would be for you but for sure there are like mispriced communities where you could just hop in and well if you know about some let me know I'm on a bunch of communities for agencies creatives and stuff like that and well I haven't found myself

2:06:00 - Patrick Kizny
  there yet, like there was one that I was part of since 2018. And then I started posting more top leadership.  when I started getting into my own consulting and advisory, I was kicked out. But anyways, I learned one thing that the the only guy who is in a position to do any meaningful top leadership over there is the guy who runs it.  Because there is no place for anybody else.

2:06:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, it kind of says, which is we've had this conversation, I think, which is one of the things not not not this thing, but the thing I'm going to say now, which is one of the reasons I think the workshops are good for me, because I can just come under the radar is like, oh, this guy is not trying to be like the consultant for consultants.  These workshops, right? So I'm less threatening in that way.

2:06:52 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, this is a very good observation stick to it.

2:06:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So And it is a little bit by design, not entirely, but a little bit. I'm aware of that, I think.  But I think, yeah, anyway, you got the point. And in terms of communities, I'm thinking of, could there be communities of older dudes that are a bit scared about digital?

2:07:21 - Patrick Kizny
  I don't know. Yeah, this is, I totally hear you. And I think this is a very valid way of thinking.  Like, look for opportunities in unsexy place. Because what is the way we're trying to get out in the world?  Like, you go and make connections with people that are loud and making a lot of noise in the social media, because these are the people you have access to, because they are out there.

2:07:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's right.

2:07:46 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and I'm doing that. Like, I started showing up on podcasts of, like, all the Max trailers, Chris Dubois, and all these guys in the circle.  But the only, there is a usual problem. they had no audience, right? like each of these podcasts will be seen by 25, 15, maybe 100 people, maximum, right?  So this is a small audience. Kris Do, we've been chatting for about a year and a half, but when I started pushing towards or suggesting towards getting somewhere, he started ghosting me.  And anyways, he's in troubles also because his business is very unprofitable. He has reached the boundaries. He has absolutely no power over growing it anymore.  So he's like scraping the bottom of the barrel already. He's done essentially in my opinion. He wouldn't tell you this, but but he's  scared and he knows that and he knows that this is the end.  He reached the end goal. is nothing more coming and one of the reasons I'm saying so is that about a year ago, half a year ago, he pulled down his mission statement.  His mission is not any more take one billion people make a living from a creative force or something like that.  Now he's trying to become another Tony Robbins. So yeah about the places I agree and there are two, she's there, well there is another one, Precoons.  Anyways about a year ago when I was starting Hypergalactic, the space agency, I went into the network of agencies or like companies for space marketing.  I've become a member and I was on one or two meet on one or two internally. use of that group and it was all crazy boring and pretending we're doing business total, total crap.  But there was a PR agency and there was like a 60, 70 years old old school guy who felt very attracted to me because I was young and  and has had all these chops and fresh perspective and stuff like that, right?  So this is the kind of like things where I'm seeing it's a fit and these are not people that are shiny on social media, right?  You meet them in the shadow. And the agency, this is interesting, consulting company I mentioned to you where the tech design is still on the table, a bunch of good people, so like few good people or whatever their name was.  Yeah, this is the same situation. This is an older guy. He's like 50 to 60 maybe. 60 something, I don't know.  And this is interesting because they are in very similar space to myself. So the discussion like started organically, but we started sharing very openly our processes and how we're doing, what we're doing, what audiences we're trying to target, etc, etc.  And we shared a good few hours like exchange of expertise and approach. And at some point he concluded, okay, it's clear to me that we're serving two very different audiences, right?  So like what I mean by that is from outside, it looks like we're possibly competitors or like fellows start getting the same kind of people.  But after alignment, even though that we're broadly really overlapping, it's clear that we're doing a very, very different thing.  So the reason I'm bringing this is that don't fear too much that you will be perceived as competition or like you would be too dangerous for them.

2:12:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, yeah, I get your point. get your point. this is also, you told me this is the best, which is this fear of everybody being a competitor comes from having, you know, not a lot of experience in the actual complexities of moving into another market or trying to steal somebody else's opportunity.  And I was convinced by that. It made lot of sense to me. Yeah, because I've just spoken to Richard Millington.

2:12:38 - Patrick Kizny
  No, I haven't.

2:12:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, there's the name Ringabel.

2:12:42 - Patrick Kizny
  No, it doesn't at all.

2:12:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this guy is a podcast now. Substack and he is along with U is one of the people that recommends my sub-stack, what's this sub-stack?  I think it's the independent, indispensable consulting, I'll send you the link. This guy, it's very easy to talk to, friendly, we have a few one or two chats a little while ago One of the things he told me was instead of creating content, I didn't do what he told me But he said just organize an event, because all the time you put in and he said it could be just a happy hour event Meaning online or offline?  Offline, he said just put some people in a room, let them talk, you talk to them, have some beers Because something will come from that, and if you make the  the cost per lead calculations, and you compare that with creating content. Sometimes that is actually more efficient. I haven't done this because, you know, logistics and I got distracted, I suppose.  But it felt like really sensible, really made sense to me. Like, yeah, instead of just trying to fight for people to see my name, I'll just go somewhere and join a few.  I don't know if where you live is close to a special business at all.

2:14:34 - Patrick Kizny
  We have raccoons.

2:14:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We could throw parties for raccoons. can throw parties for raccoons.

2:14:39 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, that's it.

2:14:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's what we do. You could interview raccoons. That's kind of another opportunity there. You could have your emoji to be a raccoon.

2:14:56 - Patrick Kizny
  Your emoji next to your name on LinkedIn. have it they don't have any no they don't have they don't have a racoon i love to trust you on that but this sounds insane it is insane it's a huge miss but look you're not seeing my video or you're seeing it yeah i am it's inside the house it's a couple a couple of them right yeah what kind of sound do they make it's like a dog no they keep barking when they are a little bit annoyed like when there is two of them they like to fight a little bit over the food so they will be doing this like but that's the only sound that we've heard

2:16:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love the details, the details are so funny, let's try to change them.

2:16:08 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, they are. Well, offline is not a thing for me, because I need clients worldwide and globally, so that's not going to work.  If I were, you know, in New York, that could work, but where I am, that's impossible. But doing something like that offline, I mean online, could be a thing.  So something which is like casual, but it's not casual and online. Something like this with Max, but a little bit more open.  He's done one good thing with like setting the context and perspective for these things. And I think he did it better than the actual format, because the format is regular, quite boring in their view.  But the good thing about how he approaches producing content is that it's the conversations that serve him and the content is a byproduct.  And today we spend another day thinking about how to cut through the . And I also talked with Rob today.  It's Tritino, right?

2:17:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. What's his take on this?

2:17:29 - Patrick Kizny
  And he came to the same conclusion that don't sweat over content. Content should be a byproduct. Go do something interesting.  Record it, it, share it. And that should be your content.

2:17:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that at least it's more meaningful. mean, just trying to, because the content is, if you look at it from like an evolutionary perspective, each  to social network goes through a Cambrian explosion, like people are experimenting new things and seeing what works. But at some point, you just figure out what's the best content for that.  And if you are a creative person that likes novelty, whatever it is, it's going to be boring, because at some point, it's everything the same.  And I suppose that the cycle of achieving stability, content format stability in social networks is probably getting faster and faster, because people transfer lessons from one social network to the other.

2:18:32 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, copycats. But at the same time, are in times where all social networks are already mature, Exactly, exactly. So it's time where the creators are generally a kind of father, right?  Social father.

2:18:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's not a lot of room for creativity and reach.

2:18:55 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, but anyways, one of the... Today, I... added a lot of and I was like trying to summarize my thinking about okay, why doesn't make sense to keep posting expert content on LinkedIn and why like I'm not seeing a space for myself on LinkedIn.  Literally, I'm not seeing a future for myself. Because becoming one of these hack bros is not my thing. posting this like kind of inside  that the algorithm posters is not my thing.  I'm not gonna ever do it. And I don't have what it takes to be successful at it. And trying to be original or interesting or like being yourself and sharing expertise and also doesn't work.  So I didn't find an answer. Like I'm not seeing myself on LinkedIn. And similarly, I'm ticked up, which is slowly dying YouTube is similar story.  But do you know Behance?

2:20:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

2:20:01 - Patrick Kizny
  So I came up with the Trojan horse for Trojan. How do you pronounce it? How do the Americans pronounce it?  Trojan? Trojan. Yeah, that's American, but that sounds so stupid. It's Trojan horse because it's Troy. It's coming from Greek.  Anyways, the hardware stack and the functionalities and features on Behance are the same as on every social network. So you have the gallery or post format and you have the real or story format.  It's called work in progress. But the thing is that Behance is a very uniform platform in terms of content because all the major platforms are non-uniform.  Meaning there are many different subjects and kinds. of content being posted and behind everything is the same, meaning people posting their , mean, their work, their projects, their designs, and maybe posting a work in progress.  So what I'm trying to do right now is to hijack this platform and start using the same platform for talking to these guys about things that nobody is talking to them about, which is poking them, sales, marketing, and doing this kind of stuff that everybody is doing on LinkedIn, but nobody is doing on, or like everybody is doing on Instagram, but nobody is doing that on Behance.  And building on that thinking, I was trying to find a similar formula for one of the major platforms, like what can you do on LinkedIn to derail LinkedIn and to rock the bolt and like really, really challenge it and really disrupt it.  But I see no I had no answer.

2:22:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And no Spotify also has comments on podcasts, right? And nobody comments on podcasts on Spotify. No, but nobody even listens to podcasts on Spotify.

2:22:13 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, but I mean, I mean, Discovery is zero. If you bring your audience, that's fine, but Discovery is zero.

2:22:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but you're just getting somebody else's audience, right?

2:22:25 - Patrick Kizny
  How do you mean? If you comment on...

2:22:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the same thing you're doing on Behance.

2:22:34 - Patrick Kizny
  But how am I tapping into the audience? When people listen to podcasts, they are on their headphones and the screen is off.

2:22:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So nobody's reading comments. No, no, I agree with that. I agree with that. But you can just spend it.  You can just go on every podcast and just comment. Check out Paco Flavor, the best advisory for creative businesses.  I'm kind of kidding, but not fully. But, you know, what could maybe be interesting, um, I have no idea, but it's just just came to me.  know, indie game designers, so they are craftspeople, right? They know that video games will not make them a lot of money.  And I suspect that video game studios have some similar dynamics to agencies, in a way. Some of them. And I could imagine that indie game designers, they are very friendly and they learn a lot from each other.  They have a lot of influences from like development and art and stuff like that. And they have some people telling them about, like, how to run a studio.  Of course, the ideal is somebody that has run an indie studio. But maybe there's a space that for teaching how to manage a creative business and not to burn out on your creativity and you know, because I don't know this crowd very well.

2:24:15 - Patrick Kizny
  I hear you, I thought about it. I don't feel very competent in that because I've never run a, you know, game studio.  Yeah, he did and we're fellows and he's, he had a company of about like 100 people at some point.  They were invested by the Chinese and they were building a cool game. He essentially opted out from that business.  It wasn't his business. was a, well, managing an art director at that company. So like he was in charge, but it wasn't his business, technically, pretty bad position to be in frankly.  And right now he's starting another third game studio, which is cool, is called Junkyard, and they are doing this wonderful small kind of like SimCity clone game or something like that, where you're building your own Junkyard, essentially with like small PlayMobile figurettes and figurines and all this kind of stuff.  Wonderful. But they are on the pre-seed level. Anyways, the... I'm not seeing an area for me there. And the reason is that I generally don't have a good fit with all the developers and dev shops and software companies, people and engineers.  And that's the reason I opted up from SpaceTag because these people are so  close-minded that it's just, there is no fit.  There is no mindset fit. And the second thing is that the art people in their... Well, they know art.  Maybe they know something about business, but like what can I bring to them? I don't feel it and I know nothing about like marketing and selling games.  Yeah, yeah, I could possibly adapt my general business and marketing chops if I had opportunities, but it would be a hard sell because even with my expertise, having run a bunch of agencies in the past, I'm having credibility issues, people trusting me to solve a simple problem, right?

2:26:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, of course.

2:26:43 - Patrick Kizny
  But yeah, well, I hear you. It's an interesting way of thinking and I have a little, like a small sample pool because I essentially know one or two guys running in the game studios.  I don't know much about these people, so my sample may be confusing. Or biasing Yeah, love to think about mm-hmm cool man.

2:27:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I get it right.

2:27:13 - Patrick Kizny
  We had a decent conversation Jesus we talked for like almost three hours wonderful afternoon a Cool, I'm Hmm the party's over Still here, you know, sometimes I just come in and Have a snack and get out and today it's like one of these days where they want to spend more time with us They miss you.
  POSITIVE REACTION:  Patrick discusses designing a free workshop with full transparency to attract an interested person. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/VuWNLeMYwoHKsZzcwj7HP9kqQycQt96Y?timestamp=8858.94
    This is They felt neglected and they want more time with you the thing visually about this timeline may make it the timeline I think this is we arrived at something very valuable Drafted feel free to share it with me if you like one last idea.

    I had for you. I Haven't implemented did it myself yet, fully, but I'm a huge believer in doing work in public, meaning instead of pulling up all the fake or not fake or semi-fake testimonials and working your  off to get some, find one person that you can design a workshop for free, but with the condition that this workshop, the entire process is recorded and it lands on your website.

    And you are super transparent, you're showing how it is, how it looks like, maybe you have a teaser out of that and you put the full process, people can watch it.

    Nobody will watch the full four or six or seven hours, but even the fact that you put it there and that you are open about it and that you have something like that, come on, that's a huge, huge credibility booster, right?


2:28:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

    Yeah, yeah.


2:29:00 - Patrick Kizny

    Because people won't spend six hours to go through that, and no, your competition will not steal this from you.

    I mean, they can try, but everything is, you know, they can steal it anyway, so...


2:29:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

    Yeah, they could steal it before I did it, of course. Yeah, no, this is a great idea.


2:29:25 - Patrick Kizny
  And then edit a quick teaser and, you know, put this as a sample.

2:29:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll do. Patrick, I gotta go. Cheers, man. This was great. Thank you for all that you shared with me.  I hope I was helpful as well. And, yeah, I'll keep thinking about the thing you asked me to think about.

2:29:49 - Patrick Kizny
  Like, whatever thing that comes up and can help you.

2:29:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cheerio, buddy. Cheerio, say hi to the missus and... Say goodbye to the raccoons. I will. Cheers.
