0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am interested in the next question.

0:24 - Bruna Rasmussen
  well, general, the thing is, you know, what difference or the human have, what and the human person.

0:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, you to see, you person It was a very good scenario. was a very good scenario. I'm very sure what's on in I think it's to be do but it's going to easier.

1:08 - Bruna Rasmussen
  It's going to be easier.

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's going to easier. want to go other Okay, so Bruno, welcome to this conversation. It's in this interview session, we will go over a scenario, and you will want to see how you evaluate the context.  How you think about the problem. how you state the problem and how you come up with recommendations regarding this scenario, okay?  Sound rates, let's do it. Okay, class pass as noticed, a significant drop in user retention rates over the past few months.  Users are canceling their subscriptions at a higher rate than usual. As a product manager, how would you investigate this issue and propose a solution?

2:30 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Mm-hmm. a Okay, so I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify when we think about retention, how exactly are we measuring retention?

3:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We are measuring retention as how many, what's the time frame between the last three sessions. So if this falls over three weeks, we consider that the not three weeks is just a little six weeks.  the client's churns.

4:02 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So if the customer has been without booking a class for six weeks, we consider that a churn.

4:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, or at least it's much colder than it used to be.

4:15 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Uh-huh. Okay. What is the crease that we've seen? Is it abrupt or has been happening throughout the months?

4:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It has been happening throughout the months. It's a bit like the frog in the hot water situation. But now, when we compare the present situation to the two months ago, the decrease is significant.

4:52 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay. Can we say that? The number of users counseling subscription is a outcome of this drop-in retention or are they happening simultaneously?

5:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could you restate the question in a different way?

5:17 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Yes, so we're talking here about two metrics. First, the drop-in retention, which I understand is a user that goes code after six weeks without booking a class.  But we're also talking about the rate of users canceling subscriptions. Is the cancellation of subscriptions an outcome of the user becoming cold?

5:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We are not sure. We assume that these things are related, but we would like to know how to investigate that and be sure of their relation.

6:02 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So the way that I'd like to approach is this question is, I will first think about how to segment this matrix in order to try to understand the root cause.  I will then try to understand the, if anything has changed in the product, then I will go through external possible reasons that may have factored this metric.  Is that okay?

6:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes, I think that's okay.

6:46 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay, so is there, is there any specific geography where we have been seeing this tendencies? Is right? Is any type of subscription and here I'm assuming there are different types of subscription that is being cancelled at a higher rate than the others?

7:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not a type of subscription but more like cohort.

7:39 - Bruna Rasmussen
  What is the cohort that would be seeing this decreasing in this metrics?

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The most recent cohort, when we compare this retention to the usual metrics. The Members for previous cohorts, comparing previous cohorts to the cohorts of the past two months, the most recent cohorts, they are the ones who were displaying these behaviors.

8:32 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Was there any recent change in the marketing strategies that we had that to acquire these customers in the past two months?

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  our partnership with the local studios, so helping them acquire clients for the platform.

9:13 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Can you expand a bit more on that?

9:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so we understand that fitness studios are our embassy in way in the real world and we've made efforts and we've been planning for this for longer than two months but for two months ago we ramped up structured initiatives around collaborating with the fitness studios so that they could refer more customers to class pass.

9:55 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And can we link the customers that where referred by these local studios to have in this higher retention drop and number of cancel subscriptions.  Yeah, we can.

10:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not 100%, but it's pretty much pretty much there.

10:16 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay. So we I think we have one of the possible causes then, which is the channel that we are acquiring these customers may have caused a change, a different expectation.  This is my hypothesis, caused a different expectation on what they would find in class bus leading to a higher retention drop and cancellation of subscriptions.  So based on this, my recommendation would be to understand how these studios are marketing class pass and understand how we can work with them to set better expectations to the user, to the final consumer, so we can keep up with the retention rates.  And also parallel to that, I would like to also conduct some interviews with these users, to understand what needs that they have that's not being choked with our current product.

11:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very good. I like both approaches. you have to, let's assume that you are a bit on the clock here, and you'll  I have to prioritize one. Which one would you pick and why?

12:15 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I think that for thinking a bit more immediately, I would go to the market to the local studios to kind of align better how we are marketing that marketing, how they are marketing class-passed to the students.  Because dropping retention and all the canceling subscription, it really increases our cost of acquisition. And it's not really driving us anywhere in terms of left-hand value.  There's clearly a gap there. So I would definitely go talk to the students first, try to do. to solve this more immediate question.  Now, I do think that there is a world where we are not meeting expectations through these consumers. So there is a potential for us to be finding out more about the opportunities that we have there for either a positioning change or a product enhancement that would then serve this discussion.  So I think that talking to the studios is the first thing that I would do. Mm-hmm.

13:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, if the audience is wrong or can find the director's cut. You know, it's a developing environment with the right tool to do that, as a part of that, you know, as a product.  Okay, so perfect. Let's assume that you've managed to speak with the perhaps five studios, up to five studios, you got on calls with them and they went through the kind of role played with you, how they introduced Glass Pass and how they work with people to join it and in this process you've understood that there's an aspect of a misunderstanding.  is common that studios overestimate the amount of credits people can get as part of their sign-up bonus from this affiliate sort of action initiative.  But I've also noticed that our onboarding sequence email onboarding sequence was repeating some of these misunderstandings. You are not directly responsible for this sequence so you might have to work with other teams to figure out what can be done.

15:40 - Bruna Rasmussen
  How would you go about this? So let me just play back that scene to understand. So what happens is that when the referral happens, the studio probably gets a margin therapy but the user also  get some free extra credits as a bonus. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And then the consumers were understanding that the bonuses was higher than it actually was.  Correct.

16:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

16:18 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And then the email rule communication that we were sending also contains a wrong communication. Correct.

16:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

16:30 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Cool. I think that I will go two ways. First, actually, three ways. First, I would communicate and make this alignment with the studios on, okay, what actually is the correct rule?  And make sure that they communicated properly for new clients that they, for, for for whom they will pitch the product.  Second, I would work with the Squad responsible for communications to ensure that the message we are communicating there is correct and aligned with what we're pitching for the students.  And third, I would take advantage of the situation to try to recover a few of these churned customers that came from Referral from Students by sending in another email offering more bonus credits if they come back to and renew their subscription.  OK.

17:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's put some numbers. How would you go about figuring out how much you can give away to recapture these churned customers?

18:13 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Next question, let me think of I'm giving you a formula right off the bat, but what I would think about is for us to understand how many credits are within a subscription, right?  And riffly understand how much each credit costs. only for the consumer, but also what is our margin on each credit.  I would then think about the cost of acquisition and understand if we're engaging these consumers would make sense given the existing cost and the potential LTV that we will have with this consumers.  If they were to engage the average number of months that we currently have with the other governments. My line of thinking would go without giving you a detail for me.

20:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, fine, very well, so let's assume, you know I was present to you. So we we have real line with the studios, we have to work with a calm square and we have to take advantage.  We have this idea of taking advantage of the situation by offering more bonus credits. Okay, so now we have an opportunity for something different.  Because class passed is based around credits and it's the credit is a very strong, you know, primitive of the business.  There's a tendency for us to think about credits as the solution for every problem. How would you go about finding other incentives or levers for action within the class pass experience?  I don't need you to make suggestions right now of what other things could be, but how would you think about this?

21:35 - Bruna Rasmussen
  First, I would like to understand what problem do we have around credits because changing how we think about credits is more of a solution and I would like to understand what are the problems that we face or the opportunities that we see.  Do we have customer problems into how it comes? customers understand the credits? What exactly are we seeing that there in terms of feedback in?

22:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's just say that we have been inspired by non-monetary incentives or stuff like loyalty that is loyalty programs that are not about financial gain or maybe we want to give we're interested in ways like me rephrase all the turntables  So right now, right now, credits, they work. We are not trying to abandon credits, okay? They are like the backbone of how we run the business.  But when we think about behaviors we want to incentivize or both from partners and customers, can we find ways of incentivizing action that do not cost us any money?

23:36 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So we are looking at both partners and users for this problem. We can pick one.

23:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let's let's be consumers.

23:47 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay. kind of behavior would we like them to have that they currently do not have?

23:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have noticed that whenever consumers join with a friend or a family member, they stay for longer and they stay more active.  So that's one behavior we would like to see devised, to sign up with other people. And we would like to be able to do this without having to lean on, oh, get more credits if you sign up with your friend.

24:38 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So we have data that backs the fact that if a user sign up, signs up with friends or family, they stay longer in the platform.  Yeah, we come over. How much longer?

24:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Twenty-five percent more longer.

24:59 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So we're talking number one. about 20% more, lot of time, value, roughly. Mm-hmm. Okay. I would, I would like to understand other data that we have.  They kind of show different specific behaviors of these people. So the question they have is, do they sign up at the same time?  Or weeks apart, months apart? What is the behavior that we've seen there?

25:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's two connections. They sign up at the same time. So they begin training at the same time. The street things at the same time, at the same place.  And also they have connected. I mean, they show up as to us, not to them, but they show up as referrals.

26:19 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So we already have a referral program from user. I know that we do for business, but do we have already a referral program for it?  Yeah, we do.

26:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We collect that information, but we don't. We know when people refer to us, but we don't do anything with it.  So we don't display this information. We don't compensate for this behavior. don't. As people to do this, we just realize when people use a referral code.

27:09 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Got it, got it. And why don't we want to use credits into this economic problem of control? We can use credits.

27:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're just thinking, are there any other things that we can do to decouple behavior from financials? But we can use credits.  Got it, got it.

27:40 - Bruna Rasmussen
  the problem that we have, the opportunity that we have is people are already using our referral program, even though there is no monetary incentive for that to invite family and friends to join with them.  for that they last longer in the platform. So the hypothesis here is that if a user joins class pass with friends or family, they will have a longer LTV.  Therefore, it's something it's a behavior that we want to incentivize. Now, I think that's when we look at the mission of class pass, which is making fitness available for more people around the world.  Having this word of mouth is key, and I agree that referrals programs really contribute to that. I would first think about maybe two different user segments here.  The first is family, the second is friends, the reason I'm segmenting it is because I think there is. quite a different social dynamics on how people choose to do things together if you are a family member or if you are a friend.  Just for the purpose of this exercise, I would focus on family. Is that okay?

29:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, if you have a specific reason for doing so, you can share it, otherwise we can just use that and go with family because yes, it's fine.

29:37 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I think that it overall has more impact and resonates more of you going to work out with your husband which are wise or with a broader more than working out with friends.  So it seems to me at first like a common scenario, thus I think it could be a broader, like a larger opportunity for us.

30:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Understand. So this is kind of a 10-based approach to selecting the... I think it's a larger opportunity than focusing on friends.

30:23 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Now, let's think about what are the... not necessarily painful ones, but what are the opportunities, the motivations of a person to work out together.  So, we can think of a user that is just beginning with his fitness life, because he just wants to get a good health, or because they are on a weight loss project.  for them to really along with dieting. We can think as well as people that already are into fitness and maybe want to have more options of studios where they can work out via class class.  And fitness is something that is generally known by someone. Everyone knows it's good for the health. Everyone should be doing it, but still most of us don't.  It's hard. Basically this challenge comes from motivation, right? So people have different kinds of motivations, but it's always easier for you just to stay on your couch.  So having some one to go with you, to a class, to the gym. It really helps this motivation lasting longer because you kind of create this compromise with your family to go work out.  I think that when we look at people that are beginning to exercise, this bond is even more important because sometimes you don't really know how to do exercise correctly.  having this motivation is even more important than if you are ready to fitness or like a gene brawl, you have your six pack, you're all figured out.  So I think that for this first group, the impact on how having someone going and working out with you is higher.  Okay, that's it, that's it. Okay, so I think that's when we think about motivation. Well, the referral logic of thinking is very straightforward.  You have a link that you sent to someone. This person will also create their accounts and it's all sad.  This guy where we could prompt this is either on right after the first person creates their accounts for example.  So they go through the onboarding flow and that's the the the the the very last page they get and they get a prompt to hey do you want to refer someone?  Want to we could even say like hey we know that people who work out with a family member, keep up with their motivation, someone to go train with you to go work out with you.  And then the dynamics is pretty straightforward. And I think that going back to your prompt, the question here is what other things could be used instead of credits as a monetary incentive to incentivize this kind of behavior?  When we think about this user that is beginning with their fitness life, they usually don't have all the stuff people usually have for working out such as, hey, simple things from a water bottle to the appropriate apparel to like a headphone.  So maybe what we could do is to offer them some sort of swag, plus plus swag. that helps them to begin their fitness life, let's put it in this way.  It's quite simple to operate at, since we have a bunch of third party companies that could do that for us, personalizing product to drop shape in it, and it's relatively low price, which would fit nicely into our cost of vaccination.  Another option that I see is just rely on virtual badges that really break up the value of what you having, the people that that's like family members working out with you.  I do think that that is classified. But it still is better than having nothing and not even acknowledging that the user has a referral.  So I think we could. This is where I'll probably try to get into more details and brainstorm. This sounds like an easy MVP that we could try out.  But I don't think it's hard either for us to do a POC on sending users. You can do that manually.  It's low cost so it wouldn't hurt really. So I will maybe try both tracks on MVP with selected groups.  Understand and the metrics that they would look at is if they refer more members. after this first one. And also, the number of users that actually end up referring somewhere, at least one person.  I would also, of course, measure, but this takes more time. I would also measure the retention rates of these specific cohorts that have been impacted by this POC.  So, just to recap, in order to stimulate users to use our referral, here I'm focusing on families, especially for users that are beginning their driving fitness, we could position ourselves as a partner into their fitness journey by either providing them some gym related swag, or a virtual badge that  them about the referral. And with that, we expect, ultimately, that this will increase their lifetime value in phosphorus, but also that they would use referrals more often.

38:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Very well. Is this the wrap up, or would you like to add something else?

38:35 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I think we can wrap up, but we want to be respectful of your time as well. Okay.

38:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  thank you. Thank you, Bruno. For this, I think it was very clear to see that you have a structured approach to not just problem solving but the problem framing aspects of this, and you've managed to navigate at least two different contexts, which are the more internal aspect of metrics and how can we know what we know, and the outside aspect of partnering up with the studios, reaching out to them, and seeing them as a resource that can be used for different things besides just communication, right?  At least this is my assumption that when you've mentioned swag tests, maybe I misunderstood a bit, besides the third party print on the main source of  So, I got the impression that there was also a possibility of using the studios as some sort of distribution for this stuff.  Did I get it correctly?

40:10 - Bruna Rasmussen
  No, no, I didn't mention that, but that's a good idea. Okay.

40:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. So, a lot of us have a physical role play. Thank you very much. I think a good talk to you, you can expect us to be in touch within two weeks.  our side, we'll just share this interview with a couple more people. And clearly, I haven't been doing interviews for a while.  So, I don't know how this stuff goes.

40:44 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Let's see you. I'm to do self-consciousness.

40:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What? What? What? I don't I don't know. don't know. don't know. I don't I I will try guess how capital can be capitalized as I'm capital of the city.

41:18 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And I want to about I the design the city's power because analysis. The boys are not a part of the conversation.  When my complex So, all in much, much, much, The DC, which of the previous episodes was a detailed orientation between DC and the DC.  So just came in and said, but I didn't think I'd look at myself in the shoes. And I think entra leum muscles so and so it's so simple for you to see the key I don't and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

43:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, what is the key to this club? I don't what say, but I know what do. I don't what do, I don't know do.  I don't but know what do. I don't know what do, but don't know to do, but know do. To ...  ... ... ... honor to have been in the U.S. English. in diverse countries, which is in So as see, us by researchers, countries, but in countries, we're on, Thank you much.  We are going to help us, know be from the future. And the age center of the world, the age only age center of world, but also the age of world.  This this is the kind of business that I have to say, not age center the world. I think it happens in Citi, software that I'm about.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. in Citi, I think very lot questions, lot questions, questions, and we have lot questions, and we have a lot of questions, in the middle and we have not sure if can that, but I a news, have a lot questions, we can talk question I've just sent to my is that we engage the customers, Thank you  We have a lot customers, customers, customers, customers, Let's look at in your car.

47:00 - Bruna Rasmussen
  In the last you is not a teacher. But in second, to In the last year, you to have a teacher.  You have to have teacher. your are working around the students. But we in our society, we have of where we are going to and the question of what question making decision and can you

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. Okay. Apart from credits. I think that's What is It's a part of the familia.  It's beautiful, it's what we need to do. a beautiful family. Now, you interested in this you see and I think that's all details the video.  I think video has host of the series. And the is by host My Keesh Munk and I'm going to come now to stay converse.  I have to tell you that subscribe me, a little bit this which doing now. My name is Keesh Munk and the you Ok.  Okay, when do I shouldn't pass my first time assumption was known the monster Yeah, a I had couple times when moment began, I university, and I able get a chance campus.  I had a chance to come to was to talk things, like, I would to give you a on I would give you little bit on this topic.  I would like you little bit information on like to give you a information on I would like to give you a little more on  to make sure that this only thing that you can do, then can't other you can't that, but you can't that much.  Yes, it's not.

51:18 - Bruna Rasmussen
  It's not if you're in a way, I'm going to frame this thing in the other side. It's very It's very important.

51:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very important. It's interesting.

51:34 - Bruna Rasmussen
  It's interesting to how it's I'm not how not how But I'm I think a super fascinating question.

  It sounds like I've I've never heard this. I've never this. I've heard this. the city That's the it.

53:20 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I've never heard this. I think about mission and goal, user segment, t-shirt size, the impact and size of each user segment, pain points, mission, go back to the mission, think about solutions, create a vision and VP features, think about matrixing the gap.  I assume that people, when they're beginning their films' lives, they feel more motivated when they're working out with someone, et cetera.
