0:01 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I'm so sorry. I was early and so I started doing something and then I was late. I apologize. No problem.

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just pressed send on an email, so you'll get it now. As you know, do you want to reschedule?  Yeah, let's do it today. Okay, sorry about that.

0:24 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Okay, so while I get your information up, tell me how feel about the information that you got?

0:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How did I feel? I got to say I was a little bit on the more analytic side of things trying to figure out like the product.  I replied truthfully, but let me see my results. And vision is my balance point. Yeah, when I saw the self-inquiry, I identified.  I remember not being absolutely sure about the vision. But not that there's anything wrong with it. It's just that compared to the yellow aspect, which was the self-inquiry, which really connected very quickly.  The vision I was a little bit less sure when compared.

1:33 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So that makes complete sense if you understand what it's saying to you. So what it's saying is when you don't have all the information you need, when you are out of your comfort zone, you lead with self-inquiry.  So if you identify with that, that makes sense, because that's your habitual wiring right now.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Check biases and assumptions.

2:02 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  You're going to look for blind spots. That's how you do the unknown Mm-hmm, right What it's saying to you is however If in those same moments It's fine if you want to leave with that, but if you wouldn't mind just adding in some vision in other words What is the new reality?  that we're going to Come up with and if you do that your mental lens will shift You'll still be able to use all your biases and assumptions, but you're gonna have a more whole picture If you do that, does that make sense?

2:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes it does So let me Try to match this because I was just just before this I was cleaning up like some blog posts from the past and Some of them were like five years old And it's so funny that I think I keep breathe discovering the same things  And they all feel like epiphanies at the time. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. The self-inquiry for sure, and now also the vision as the correcting maneuver.  I also could see that. You know, there's, I don't know if I told you this, because I told this to someone recently, I don't know if it was you.  And I don't wanna go on a huge tangent. It's just, you know, connects to your point. For the longest time, I've been trying to build up confidence by accumulating competence, right?  So the more competent I am, the more confident I'll feel, which doesn't work like that because you go up the mountain and you see, oh, there's more stuff over there.

3:51 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I need to learn that stuff.

3:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And somewhat, which I think points towards like the self-inquiry, like there's something, there's something that's missing that... need to get.  There's something that's missing that I need to get. And recently I've noticed that, yeah, I should shift that. And the confidence will not come from just confidence.  It's not we need something else. And I see the vision connecting with that aspect. yeah, it's very tidy. Yeah.

4:23 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So the challenge, did you put a challenge in there to remember what your challenge was? I think it was a little bit prosaic.

4:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it prosaic or prosaic? Prosaic. Thank you. But it's something that's been on my mind, which is something about my website.

4:45 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Okay. So again, you know, you can look through your self inquiry lens. But really, if you say, but what is the new reality that I want to achieve with this?  Where are you trying to get to that you're not?

5:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when I look outside the cameras, usually because I'm thinking, some people find that weird, but yeah, yeah, for sure.  For instance, and I think this again relates to the confidence thing, which I've noticed it was like a salient salient point, which is the problem the website is trying to fix, right?  Or the gap that the website is trying to fix is to have like a simple place. I can send people and they understand what they do, right?  And there's two things that conflict with which is, you know, defining what I do and also

7:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  But what I just want an easier UX for the client. So then I brought in a UX designer, now these designs are happening, now they can get put into effect.  Yes, there is a number that comes with it, but you know what, I can decide when to do that.  But I think about the new reality of like when that's done and how much time and effort and space that's gonna free up for me.  You know, I'm like, oh my gosh, totally, right? That's 100% worth it. So that's how you can use your new reality, right?  It's like, okay, I do actually love building it by myself. Okay, great. Well then the new reality is then let's get it done, right?  And the new reality is really seen when it's done and really having people go to your website and go, oh my gosh, yes, I have to have this.  know, just like how I felt when I got your email. was like, I don't really know what he's talking about but I love how he saw me, right?  I didn't know what you do but you saw me so clearly. You know, so that, you know, that's some feedback for you.  like put that on the website, right? Like, you know, we see you in the marketplace, right? We know how to make you stand out in the marketplace because we see you for who you really are.  So if you are struggling to, you know, connect to your audience, you know, have the conversion rates, the data, like, what are the problems that come up from that?  Then, you know, schedule a call with us. You know, for me, I want to be known but I want people to know us as innovative and different and have  we get there in a nanosecond you know and there's something about that email that you sent me that I was like this guy is different.

9:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I do think that when I get like testimonials or stuff like that that's usually something that people seem to appreciate.  I think I'm competent at finding points of connection with others. And I thank you for the advice and a nice compliment.  Yeah and I feel that yeah it's impossible to do this kind of work that I'm doing without that empathy thing which is it's not just about developing a product but it is a product from someone's brilliance right so the brilliance is connected to the way they think and they see the world and everything so it's  It's nice to hear that it's being done well on my side, and that it connects. it's good. Thank you.  OK, so yeah, I did the assessment. And especially now with this additional bit of context, it makes a lot of sense, for sure.  And I can also see it from a little parenthesis. This conversation we're having right now, it starts with the topic is going to the tool and getting the assessment.  And so my dilemma is, how far do we go into that? Or when do we shift into helping you think is true and figuring out ways of doing things together?  Because. I don't know, this is valuable to me actually to get your input on this thing, but I don't want to just spend your time and not talk about the things that I can help with it.  So what would you prefer?

11:12 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Well, I think we can do both because this is part of the product, right? So how we typically do it is we will have a conversation like this so people can really understand how to use it and then they decide if they want to upgrade or not.  So based on this conversation, they either say, yeah, this is something I now understand it, I now understand how valuable it could be to learn how to develop my vision and then you say, okay, well, then you, you know, let's go ahead and upgrade into the full experience.  Again, typically I don't usually do one-on-one stuff. I mean, if it's a CEO and they want to vet it before bringing it into their teams, I might do something like that.  but typically that's the reason for this is sort of like a vetting thing. So, you know, we can go back and forth between the two if you want, you know what I mean?  Because we can keep, like, let's just use it real time, you know? don't know everything about this, but what I would say is, you know, bring in your vision and lead with your vision.  It's like, well, what is the new reality we're trying to create here? No?

12:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. This is really interesting.

12:30 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  It really matters.

12:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the way I'm thinking about this out loud is you have, so you've lived things, gave you a certain perspective, and then you've noticed that this perspective was useful and good for not just yourself, but for others.  And you'd like to take this perspective and the clarity. gives you to other people. So you build a business around that and over the course of building this business eventually you develop this journey of people joining in, they can do this assessment, they get to know, they enter your world, right?  It's world-building. They see like all the little wordplay about the reins and that kind of thing. They start to get that the texture that we mentioned that would, they get the assessment, they see something that perhaps they didn't know about themselves and and they say, okay they get me or they there's a way forward, I can see a way forward for this, right?  And then they could decide to upgrade. Now very like technical question, this It's a great decision. Is it an individual decision or is it like done at the HR corporate level?  No.

14:08 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So again, if I'm with an individual, they are usually a decision maker. They may, once they've gone through it, once they've said, okay, yeah, this is great.  I get it. I want to go through the three-week thing. And then do they have to bring it to someone?  Well, it depends. If they're the CEO, no.

14:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They make the decision.

14:33 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  If they're the head of purpose, yeah, they might have to go to the CEO. So we try and be very specific about, you know, well, before we do this, do you have the budget?  What is going on? How many people do you have? You know, we try and do all, we do all of our qualifiers beforehand.  You know, because again, and people are very intrigued by it, but I don't need a lot of tire kickers, you know?  Um, and I haven't put it up on the website just because I don't want a lot of tire kickers Understood got it got it.

15:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So because you just give me access And we keep the qualifying right I was like pre qualified. Okay, okay.  Yeah, okay, so Can you tell me a little bit more about the qualifying process? I'll do you do it?  Yeah, hold on one second.

15:23 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I gotta let my dog out Um Yeah, it's pretty organic, you know Now we've I just worked with matt So we've got a scorecard that i'm trying to get finished And that will actually go on the website and that will be our qualifier So it has a series of 24 questions all about you know You  all structured in a way to say you know where where are you in your readiness level right so that's gonna go on the website but but then you know how it how it's gone right now is just me very organic you know I get introduced to someone we have a conversation you know and I'll just ask them those questions directly I think it's maybe not as effective because I get very excited about people or the potential or whatever and sometimes because my balance point can be curiosity and so sometimes you know I just want to dive into the possibility and and then I've done this a few times you know where someone is yes yes yes and this is what we want to do and yes we can do it and then you know they go through the experience and they love it and then they're like okay I got what I needed and we're not gonna move forward type thing so  This is where, again, I do my best to really say, is it real? it not? But that's how it's been.  And that's why I wanted to switch over to the scorecard, because now what I can do is just say, okay, Joe, did I say that right?  Were you good?

17:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

17:19 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Okay, you know, what we're going to do here is you're interested, great. Why don't you go through our scorecard and we'll just get a sense and feel of, you know, where you are with your teams?  And it'll show, like, not ready at all, because it asks questions like, what's your budget? How do you currently do things now, you know, that kind of stuff.  So I think that will be helpful.

17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. It's funny you've mentioned that of kind of jumping into it, like at the start, and perhaps kind of giving a lot of value or  you know, start, you know, problem solving in real time, because I've seen other people mention that, like, they say the same thing, it's like, I get really excited, and I like to solve or think together, and then they start, you know, opening tabs and showing things, and eventually it's like, I think it comes from a place of trying to be very helpful and trusting the value of what we know.  Yeah. And sometimes people, I mean, we do such a good job that, yeah, they don't need to buy anything else.  Yeah, exactly. It's, yeah. Okay, so there's a qualifying process, which is becoming a little bit more standardized, and this qualifying process, the output of it is the readiness level, right, which is used for them and for you.  Start, like, the, what's the range? It's like, ready, not ready, or just...

19:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Um, uh, no, I'd say let's see ask me that again. So I really understand it Mm-hmm.

19:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if I go through the The scorecard Yeah, at the end I get some sort of a result. Yeah, guess that the result is in a range Right between not ready at all and let's do this right now super ready.

19:22 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah.

19:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so it's like Four five levels of readiness through levels.

19:29 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, so not ready ready, but you know Can't you know can't figure something out and then you know super ready almost we don't even really need it We're going, you know all cylinders it and so what I turn that into is so the one thing that you can do is set yourself up to Always see your blind spots Right, so let me even see if I can pull up the different  I'll use and show you. Yeah, so let me just show you this.

20:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you want me to take out the notetaker to remove it from the call?

20:24 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I'm OK if you're OK. OK, so this is just the landing page, right? So close the gap between strategy and execution on demand.  You know, I don't know if this is going to still say the same. I might change it to, you know, Dauntless or something like that.  How he says your team's Dauntlessness. You know, close the gap, you know, so that's that's where it is. If I go to the.  results page, and again this is just still a draft, but you'll be able to see it more. And we're probably going to use this one.  So what is your team's operating system score? So we've got Dauntless Game Changers. So this is the one that I just said, it's like you're crushing it, you're leading with impact, you're rewriting the rules of your industry, you're setting standards of others.  However, even the best teams face blind spots, cracks form when the status quo becomes your comfort zone. These cracks small at first can widen leaving your vision vulnerable.  The difference Dauntless teams close those cracks. that's sort of like the top of the top. So for me, I'd be pretty interested in those teams, right?  They'd be easy to work with. I think we could get some good track. and Dauntless Seekers are like the middle sector.  progress is happening, but it's harder than it should be. So they're working a lot, but there's a gap between effort and impact that's holding them back.  So for them, it's like imagine if your teams could have laser focus, execute seamlessly, achieve breakthrough results faster, that's where we can go.  And this is your team is stuck, but not because they're not trying. So again, I didn't want to say, so this may be our biggest sector, I would imagine, the middle sector, I could be wrong.  This sector, but I didn't want to leave anybody out. It's like, but they don't have the budget, they don't have the resources, their teams are super stuck.  It could be that they're super stuck, but they do have the resources, in which case that would be pretty interesting.  But it's like, What we're going to talk about here is how you decrease your uncertainty and increase performance. Right?  So each one got something about why it's not working and what could be different.

23:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does that make sense? It does, it does. And I like the fact that there's some direction in what they could do.  Would you share the questions with me at some point? Because I think it's 24, Yeah.

23:34 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yes, I can. And we can also just take a look at it now if you want. If it will load.  So here are the questions. We have a proven strategy to transform pivotal risk and disruptions into opportunities turning chaos into competitive advantage.  Chaos is winning. Help to return disruption into. old, right? So we try, so I will send these to you, but you can see there's always like a really not good, we're able to stay focused on creating strategies, you know, so we don't get stuck in the weeds.  No, we live in the weeds and we are weed free, right? So, you know, we have a system that scales growth seamlessly eliminating bottlenecks, know, scaling, we're just trying to get out of first gear, scaling is our sport, and then, you know, in the middle.  So it's, that's how all of these go. So yeah, I can, I can send this to you if you want.  Can we go back to the first one, please, the first question?

24:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I like how kind of detailed it is, right? But can you tell me, like, what's what's the question behind the question because there's like a layer of what I want to know and the way I ask it.  What are you, Lisa, trying to figure out with this question?

25:13 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  If they have a strategy or not, you know, how do they navigate disruption and risk? Maybe that's a better way to say it.  How do they currently do it? Do they have a strategy? Do they not have a strategy?

25:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And why is this important for you?

25:39 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Because it tells me where they are as a team and as a company. In other words, if they if they are in chaos, you know, then chances are that they don't have a strategy or if they have a strategy, there's a reason that they're not  executing it and probably the reason that they're not executing it is because they don't know how to do change.  So I just want to see where they are in that disruptive approach. Got it.

26:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it. So what I'm trying to figure out here and maybe we won't speak like this session but it's exactly that.  how you think about them in terms of what are the the dials that can be adjusted, right? Right. Okay, do they navigate chaos?  Do they have a strategy? Do they not have a strategy and stuff like this? in your experience what's like the biggest predictor of a good engagement?  this client will be amazing.

26:55 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Number one predictor here I can stop sharing if you want. So, number one predictor is the actual leader, so who I'm going to be interacting with on, you know, throughout the engagement.  And if they're a great leader, so I've had experiences, I had one, and the leader was not a leader, and it was a very difficult experience.  She literally did not know how to lead her teams. So, she should have just done an experience with me first, I think.  That was a couple years ago before I learned this. So, number one predictor of a great experience is the actual leader.  know, I've got my classic, you know, if we could have every experience with that type of leader, you know, we have a client like that, and they are, they are  They are They are fearless. are visionary. They are people-centric. They are present. They are accountable. So, you know, you really feel like you're working with someone.  So, I would say that's the number one predictor. You know, how organized or chaotic they are is another impact moment.  So, in other words, this is a very structured experience. So, if they, you know, if they have someone on their end that actually manages their schedules and, you know, coordinates with us on that, and if there is a change, let's us know ahead of time and works with us on that.  And that's all the way through, you know, our onboarding with them, paying our invoices, you know, signing our paperwork.  That's another predictor.

29:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you, I could see that making a huge difference. So in your assessment, it's like one of the questions related to what systems or what rules do they have in place to make sure things happen, something like that.

29:23 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I think I do. Let me whiz through. So there's a few things. There's... Oh, I'm sorry. I stopped sharing this.  again. So we have a system in place that ensures every new idea very your lesson is seamlessly integrated and put to work.  you know, that can indicate, you know, where they are. I don't think I have anything specifically about that. We have this one, or model of well-being that might fall into that.  Got it. This one is about execution.

30:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, okay, but I think given that you'll send the whole question list later, this is good enough for broad strokes now.  Then I have another question, is the readiness is also related to how nice it will feel to work with them, I think, in some way.  Like higher readiness, you put the questions together in a way that higher readiness, they're probably nicer to work with than just following through and so on.  Is this correct? Yeah. And the people that fall off that, so they don't hit that level, they're not ready.  So what I'm thinking is, if the high readiness level, it's the people that are ready to work with us, I would assume that maybe they are not the ones complaining about making too much of an investment right away.  So the product we need, it would be like for less-rating You are kind of non-believers yet not non yet believers.  I don't know.

32:03 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, I that's what I mean I think almost like the middle segment might be our biggest segment where they're having a lot of pain points and They probably have the resources and they're they would spend them But they you know one they need to have that, you know They need to be able to focus on it and then say yes I think I think that's gonna be our biggest group And the others, know the ones that are you know, just they're just not in that space I don't know that we spend time there Okay, so this is very interesting because I I've never read the book.

32:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just quote the only thing I know about it Which is like the beginning of Anna Karenina, right? Every happy family.  It's the same something like that having the same way So This middle segment, which is probably the largest, they probably have different ways of not being great, different things that stop them from being great.  And it seems that it would make sense to try to figure out of those, of that constellation of factors, which ones we should be focused on as pain points that direct the developing of an offer that hits them.  So let's say that 30% is about not having any time. So this is something we should keep in mind in terms of what we create for them.  And maybe 60% is about not understanding the value of the process. These are two different pain points that we should try to address with perhaps different products.  So I think that the thinking here is like in terms of converting these non-believers into believers, there's probably a set of arguments  we can make that convinces a larger percentage of these people. Yeah. Do you have an intuition on which factor gets disqualified the most people?

34:15 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Hmm. Yeah, you know, for some reason, I still think my instinct says price. I still think that's the biggest factor.  I don't know what people are expecting this to cost, and I think it's because they're not clear about like, am I a coach, am I a strategic consultant, like my advisory board for forever said, oh my gosh, you just give so much away, you just give all your strategy away, you just, you know, so I have a feeling  And that might play into it, if they're comparing me to a $500 an hour coach and then, you know, I say it's $55,000 for five months.  That's a, even though it's actually probably technically the same amount and you get more with us because you get a whole development platform and you get the science stuff, all this stuff that coaches have to go and get and then add to their offering.  I think there's that, I think because we don't look like a strategic consultancy, you know, that might come into play too.  So, yeah. Okay.

35:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this question might be a little bit awkward or weird. don't know. Do you want to be a strategic consultant?  I just don't know what else to call.

36:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  ourselves because I'm not I'm not a coach. I mean I know people keep calling me a coach and I know coaching is a huge industry and at one point we're looking at it's like okay well if you're gonna be called a coach be called a super coach you know because I've never been to coaching school you know I don't and again for me it's like why I can talk to CEOs because I've built companies a lot of coaches have not built multi-million dollar companies you know maybe they were an employee at one point you know maybe they were an HR at one point that you know but there are people out I mean there's there are some coaches that are out there that have done that but there's not a lot of them you know and so I I think that's a big part of it is that people don't know what to call me you know either individually or you know what you know I don't I'm being called a consultancy I think it's kind of boring but actually even think it's accurate  But what I'm thinking is people will compare us always and if we can nudge the way they compare us, at least we have some agency over that, right?

37:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. like on a very silly, perhaps too basic level, it's like just showing them all work on a two by two and we can sketch it.  These where consultants are, these where consultants are, we are this thing, we are a different thing, right? But showing them or just having this in the speech like addressing that that, because there's something about the category creation, right?

37:57 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  It's really, it's really

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  enticing to create a category but it's also it's a memetic thing it's about to people understand the category I'm creating is this a sticky thing or this is just really clever and works in my mind so it's it's it's a two-way street to make a new category works so what I'm thinking is even if it's a new if it is a new thing we should perhaps or we could perhaps help them frame this new thing as compared to other things that they already know right yeah and this I see that maybe there's something in there so do you think that changing the framing would change their price in ctv since since since yes what do you think would be the best framing um

39:03 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Well, I think if I were looking from their point of view, I think what would change it is, one, that it's a company, you know, that there's more than just me.  I think really understanding that it's, even though I'm not a neuroscientist, that it's neuroscience. I think what's unspoken is that it works and that traction happens quickly in embeds so that there's sort of an evergreen ROI.  I think that is missing. A lot of stuff is like, you know, well, we've done whatever and, you know, then we have to keep doing.  And this is, you know, This is a shift in thinking and perpetuity, you know, once you have it, you have it.  I also think there's something to, like, I want to be known as the Yeti in our particular arena. And so, you know, people pay, what, two, three times as much for a Yeti?  I mean, the coolers.

40:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, the coolers, they've got, you know, this Yeti, you like... We don't have them here, but they know them for coolers.

40:37 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, you know, I mean, the coolers are crazy expensive, but everyone wants a Yeti. You know, why? Because it's a status symbol.  That's not insane. I want us to be a status symbol.

40:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You There's a blog post I'll send you. And maybe this is me shooting myself on the foot, because it's not my work.  But I think you'll like it. so there's the synthesis of it is. Brazilian company, innovation company, innovation consulting does like week long innovation sprints, right?  This is not like a new thing. Yeah, but they've managed to and the people that founded it are. Not just really clever, but they are very well connected like in the fashion industry in the publishing industry.  They have like this. Kingmaker pedigree sort of thing. and and they they found a way of the way they do it.  It's a lot about a lot of a lot about. that is related to the experience design. And they found a way of creating such an elevated experience of a design screen, which is basically what it is, that they are very cool to work with.  And people want to work with them, right? Then you get like, instant champions inside of a client, because they want to hire those guys.  They want to be a part of that cool project that takes place, I don't know, Costa Rica, and they stay a week there to have ideas.  But I think, and they have a method, right?

42:34 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  And I think it could be interesting.

42:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you might like to check it out. I'll send it to you. I made a note. So if it's the price, and if it's the framing, and if you would like to be a status symbol, that you're coming to be a status symbol, working with you.

42:55 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yes, I've never said that out loud. That's exactly what it is. How does it feel?

43:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It feels a bit egoistic But it feels clear Yeah, I I feel the same way about my my thing, but I think my vision is still needs a couple of years and I've been you know Shifting my reading from the technical into the more symbolic because I think status symbols are about that.  Yeah, so I understand what you mean and Okay, so we would like to be a status symbol this would perhaps filter clients and What do you think it's You said you said the Yeti example and he used like your own glass Can you tell me a little bit more about?  Well, it was for you, like the last time you had something that you wanted for the status symbol?

44:16 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, hold on. The last time I wanted something that was like a status symbol. You know, I think there's a lot in my life like that.  You know, like even in the like starting with food that I eat, right? I mean, it is the great organic brands.  Do you know what I mean? So I think that's it where I shop. You know, I like shopping at, you know, the sort of, I guess they would be like considered the higher end.  you know i mean the the place that i like to go to is called natures oasis and you go in and it's beautiful beautiful to shop there it's a beautiful experience it's not like you're under fluorescent lights with like so many products bombarding you that you just can't wait to get out like i can't go to walmart i can't go like even in some of these big supermarkets it's i i can i go there but it's it's like how quick and i stop breathing when i walk in how quickly can i get out of there as opposed to this is a real it's a delight you know the lighting is lovely the the way that things are laid out is great the products are great everything's great not really happy when i walk out of there with you know three little bags that have cost you know eight hundred dollars whatever but um but every product that i you know bring home i love to eat so i'd say that's kind of a status symbol  For years, I drove a Cayenne, so a Cayenne is a Porsche. Now, I did not buy this for myself.  My husband bought it for me, and he bought it because he researched all kinds of vehicles. And, you know, we live very remotely, and there's very extreme weather.  so he wanted the safest car possible, and he actually called it a truck. He wanted the safest truck possible for me, because technically a Cayenne is a truck.  And I never understood cars, like guys in cars, until I got in this Cayenne. And I was like, well, this is just a whole different experience.  Like, this is not driving. This is, I don't know what this is, you know? So, as again, as I'm saying this out loud to you, and again, you know, even with clothes, like my mother taught me, it's better to buy one cashmere sweater that you're going to wear your whole life than...  you know, three little cheapy sweaters that are going to fall apart. So I've always sort of had that with with my clothes.  So and what is that? That's about trusting the quality really in all of that. It's like trusting the quality.  If I'm going to purchase something, I want to have a great experience with it and I want to trust the quality of it.  You know, I want to know that I made the right decision and that every time I look at it, it feels great.  know, Yeti's lived forever. You know, I mean, my Cayenne was 20 years old.

47:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think that Cayenne's for that long. I thought it was more recent time flies. Oh, yeah.

47:53 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  And the thing is what's crazy is that the only reason that, you know, I gave it up is because  They had actually stopped making some of the parts the last time I needed a part. It had to be shipped in from Germany So, okay, that doesn't really fit with my eco-friendly, you know, so You know, it's not like I don't go I'm I don't go out I don't have to have the latest Sunglasses, you know the latest trendy thing.  I don't have to wear a certain brand of Jean Um It's not that type of Signal on my personal clothing But it is it is about, you know, why I have a Mac versus a PC.  It's just a better experience for me It's a beautiful experience. I guess, you know beauty, you know an experience or big a big signal to me of status It doesn't have to be big But it has to be quality  Did I answer that properly? I think so, I think so.

49:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can see some things in, like there's a specific kind of sweater I've been looking for and there's a weird thing about Brazil which is it's very large but in terms of like there's not a lot of offer for things that you want like manufacturers because import taxes are high and site is very skewed so there's not a lot of middle-class it's either very rich and you probably buy things or you're very poor and you get like this stuff.  It's kind of a weird place to be to be not rich or not poor and and there's a specific kind of sweater that I've been looking for I mean doesn't exist in Brazil for sure even when I go to Portugal it's very difficult to find and  I think I'll have to order it from the UK and they it's like a pool and there's all these kind of things but I'm I don't want to buy clothes online because I don't know if it's to flip me I want it to be a mess to I don't so I understand what you mean because I think that's kind of thing I want and just you know the look works and I don't have to worry about that yeah beauty and experience and experience right so what I'm thinking is if it is about beauty and experience and reliability you know like I can trust it like you know when I think of status it's something

51:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  that you know you can trust. It's not going to fall apart. You haven't been taken advantage of, know, that kind of, it's like, you know, I mean, if you look at all the great, you know, brands, you know, I mean, okay, know you're going to pay for it, but you also know that it's going to work.

51:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's, there's a couple of things around those brands, right? Like, there's, there's, there's an element of history oftentimes, because they've been around for long enough.  There's an element of scarcity, like it's not, it's not available for everyone. It doesn't start when you want. You get on, you get in line to get a, to get a course.  You cannot buy a Ferrari if those guys don't want you to. That's right. So there's a whole of this managing the interaction, right?

51:55 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah.

51:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They probably have people at Ferrari just to do, do, do diligence on clients before they actually allow them to buy a survival.  So there's an architecture around creating this distance. And I sent you an interesting, I don't know if you could open it, if not that interesting, yeah?

52:15 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, but share it, yeah.

52:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we can maybe use it to explore this. So this is a bunch of different things. And those that got my eye mostly, and we are using this as just a creativity seeds, doesn't have to be this, right?  But the thing that got my eye mostly were related to, they were all kind of like press kits for stores.  I think it was this one, right? Yeah. So there's there's a, in these examples at least, there's a physicality to it.  And I think, What I like about the physicality is that by definition it's a real experience, has a smell, it has a weight.  And it's also something that doesn't scale and because it doesn't scale, it's something that people understand that it's not cheap or requires a certain level of care.  My question around this is would it be, so going back, so it started from people that get on the middle range of readiness, and our current assumption is they stay here mostly, there's other reasons, but mostly because of price.  They don't think that the program is worth what it costs. And for them, another assumption is that they would perceive the value if we could emanate the status of working with this provider.

54:13 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Now here's the thing that's interesting. People around the value, once people have experienced it, they know it's worth it.  Like I'm working with this client now, this is the third company she's brought me into and we're doing a team, we're doing a couple of executives and I discounted it pretty significantly because I knew that it might be hard for the CBO to understand.  Her comment back to me was, is that at all? And then she sort of caught herself and I was like, aren't it?  You know what I mean? But I'd rather have that than a trusted loyal client go, okay, now that's too close to the line.  You know what I mean? So there's this thing, like I say, I think the pricing is because people, they're equating us with something.  Going back to this brilliant line of questioning that you're leading us down. So I just wanted to be clear about that.  Or even people that come back a second time, it's still kind of a, you know, and that's why I think they're not in our right revenue bracket, or they're just not used to equating what they're getting for the price.  In other words, if you look at it with their revenues, it's like 0.6% of their revenue. And what they get is traction in five months or 10 months that they couldn't get someplace else.  So I'll give you an example. A COO contacted me and he said, it's the team, it's the team, it's the team, it's there's one toxic member.  Once, you know, we do something And with that toxic member, then the team will change, and then we'll be able to go where we need to go.  OK, so I met the toxic member. He was toxic. I was like, you know, whatever. And then I started, you know, talking with the COO.  And then I said, you know, what I really need to work with is I need to work with you and the CEO.  Because the two of you actually are not aligned. You're not on the same page. And so we need to get you on the same page before we even look at the team.  That's what they did. And this was a three-month sprint. That's when I used to do shorter sprints. And, oh, this is what happened.  The stick in the wheel was not the toxic team member. The stick in the wheel was the CEO who had been a founder, had grown the company to where he had grown it to, and literally was sort of terrible.  verified to go to the next level. Because they had to do a complete pivot away from what they started with.  And so once that got cleared, COO and CEO went like this. They have surpassed their KPIs that they put in place.  This was I worked with them six months ago, surpassed them. Plus the KPIs that were still a little wonky have stabilized.  Now we can work with the team. the CEO, I think it's really the COO and probably because his numbers, know, his bonus is probably based on numbers.  So he doesn't really want to spend the money. He's like all beta anything, right? In other words, he loves the value of it.  He loves what he gets from it, but he's cheap. But that's my perception.

58:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you went, you got in at the top and then you got in the rest of the team.

58:10 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So that's what I'm saying. Part of it is then there's a big effort then to then talk about rolling it out.  And why is that? I think it's got to do with what we just spent $55,000 or $110,000 or whatever.  And now we need to bring it out to the team and that's another $55,000. But it's like based against what?  So I don't know. I say, this case is something I can feel and it's transactional.

58:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it could be interesting because you certainly have this because you've been doing this for a while. But I think it could be interesting to try to.  get, like, concrete evidence for the things we suspect around how they make decisions. So I'm going to give you an example.  I think it's relatively common, quite common, to have, like, a learning and development budget, right, for employees. And this budget is per employee per year, right?  So this is the thing that we know, and we can think about this. But there may be other factors that we don't know about how they make these sort of decisions, right?  And they change from company to company and so on. Because the qualifying scorecard, it's a lot more, because there's different kinds of questionnaires we can make, right?  There's, like, customer discovery to understand what their problem was, the world, what's hurting, how do they talk about problems, when they look for alternatives.  this, what have they tried, know, stuff like this, which I think there's a lot of insight into, ah, so they are comparing us to this thing.  So this is the problem we need to address, right? And I can give you like a simple example. I've been doing these like workshops for expertise things for a while, but I was always kind of assuming that, you know, people understood what workshops were and stuff like that.  And then it was a little bit embarrassing because I've been talking about the benefits of actually interviewing customers not to sell them anything, but just to learn from them, right?  And then I told myself, I need to go back to square one. I need to forget what I know about this, I went back to reading and was like, how do you interview customers, right?  And then I did that for like seven customers, not a lot. And it was really informative in terms of like, how do you  describe what's difficult for them, what they compare me to, you know, things like this. So I think we could find really useful information in an exercise like that.  At the very least, do you record calls?

1:01:20 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Sometimes, you know, people are a little funny about that.

1:01:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's, it's fair enough because at the very least, there's probably some things that you already have yourself that we could, like, drop into AI note takers and see what they extract.  Okay. So let's see this.

1:01:41 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I just dropped in the scorecard for you. I just figured instead of sending the questions, I'll just send you the draft.

1:01:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, okay.

1:01:47 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Please take the whole thing.

1:01:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me just save this password somewhere. Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

1:01:54 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I mean, I can ask people and I can just, you know, I'm, I think in that type of situation,  they don't mind being recorded as much, so I think that's actually a great idea.

1:02:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can send you, I've made a kind of a compressed or collected notes on how to do this sorts of interviews.  Okay. I can send it to you. Okay. And yeah, it was really helpful for me because it was like half an hour of conversations, easy, and just understanding what's the mental model that people have around our work, and then it's easier to identify, so that's what they compare us to, right?  This is a simple thing we could do for sure. Because my thinking is when I go down this path of, okay, this is our assumption, this is our assumption, this is our assumption, is that if at some point we are making an assumption that we're not correct on it, we'll just waste a lot of energy and  We focus on time and money on it. So also, another thing that could be interesting is to interview clients that have said no, but we don't ask them like, what did you say no?  We try to understand the context in which they make the decision. Because if we ask, what did you say no, they'll say price, right?  But if we try to understand the context around how they made the decision, and I don't know how to do this, right?  I've never done this. I just know that this is a doable thing. We can also understand if we are addressing those things.  Because I think the easiest thing for me would be technically easier, not morally easier. Just say, oh, you need a workshop or you need something like that.  But if we're solving the wrong thing, we'll do something really, we'll have fun working together. But it might not make a difference in the way people are convinced of taking the next step.  So I think I'll, do that. Basically, I would do this. I'll send you the thing. You take a look at it.  If you have helped with converting it into a script for interviews, you can do that. And then you try to schedule a lot of calls, like half an hour calls in a short amount of time.  And my suggestion is that you make, you leave the AI on, which is good, but you also make like token nodes.  And we look for patterns, oh, whenever they say something related to a pain point, you write it down, right?  Whenever they say something good. And with that, we create a model of how they think. And based on that, we would see what's the match between how they think and what we can do at Kista Carayo.  Okay.

1:04:49 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  do you feel about this?

1:04:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I feel it's brilliant.

1:04:54 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I feel like it's really headed in a, in, I love how you think. And I think this is what I needed, but I didn't know this is what I needed.

1:05:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I get that a lot. I need to be better at explaining what I do as well. It's so ironic.  But thank you for saying that. So, I'll send you the stuff, and I'll put everything in an email in a few minutes.  Okay. think about it over the weekend, and then we'll figure out how to take it from there. Okay.

1:05:30 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  That sounds really, really great. Yeah, super great.

1:05:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. A of our conversations always really reach for me as well, so thank you.

1:05:44 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  You're welcome. So, if you want, or if you need, or if you don't want to, whatever, I I can go ahead and upgrade you if you want so you can get a sense and a feel.  Or what I can say is, you know, we're headed into a new UX.
