  João. João.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Actually, I'll test this with you, because I think it's kind, when you people aspect, so I've created this.  a little beige, you are the first person I'm sitting in this and maybe in future you can check it out.  Anyway, not serious at all, just me having fun.

1:12 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  That's awesome, that's awesome.

1:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you, I'm excited to...

1:17 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  You are? Yeah. Yeah, the Fanatic really helps there. You can reach Fanatic?

1:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can't. I have figure it out, yeah. Good. That's awesome.

1:29 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  So you're in Portugal? I am Portuguese, but I live in Brazil.

1:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, you're in okay. Yeah, I'm currently in Brazil. And I spent some time in Portugal, my wife and I, tried to go there and spend some time on we can working, you know, remote working and that kind of thing.  So, yeah.

1:55 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  But right now I'm in Brazil. I'm really, I find your content... and on LinkedIn is really strong. I'm enjoying it.

2:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I really appreciate you saying that. Because LinkedIn doesn't anyone.

2:09 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Well, you know, the videos, just the tone, I think you're nailing it. I think it's great. Thank you so much for saying that.

2:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It really means a lot.

2:20 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  I've come across David Hu's content. Are you connected to him, too?

2:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know how I found him for the first time. But at the point, I've started to move closer to that agency world.  Because my understanding is like consulting and consulting work and agency work are not the same, but they're kind of similar in some ways.  And the good thing about agencies is that they are much more visible. They are out there, they're talking about their work.  So it's easier to find them. So I started to to find people that you know do advisory work for agencies Yeah max trailer David's Mike Greenberg and then it distings, you know one thing with the other one of the things that I like about David and I told him this because I met him for the first time this week yeah, is that He he right.  It's pretty text heavy. Yeah, but in a good way, right? You can tell that that's a language It's you know very accustomed to so he writes well and he writes in a very clear way And I think good writers are usually good thinkers So I like that in his work and we had that with it.  We had a chat. I think Tuesday I met him for the first time.

3:47 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Yeah Yeah, so we met through a group called the Bureau of Digital which is a Association for agency owners, right?  You asked me about that.

3:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes

4:00 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  And I joined, I think, last June after a friend of mine, Suryamriyal, recommended that I join that group. And I was keeping an eye on David's stuff.  And we had a preliminary sort of, you know, introduction, phone call, and I got to understand what he does.  And I, to him, I wasn't ready for his program. When I was ready, I would let him know. So I think in October, remember, we, you know, went back and forth in formal agreement, and he's been helping us.  And he's got a really, really strong process. It's pretty unbelievable, actually. So I'm totally a believer in what he's brought to our agency.  That's really great. I saw that you left him.

4:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it was an unprompted testimonial. Yeah.

4:54 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  So the Bureau of Digital has run through a Slack channel. was in Slack. And that was part of a of a bigger note that I left in Slack.  So he's, he's been great. In fact, like, all of the work that we're doing is kind of led to this phone call.  Because everything I'm doing now is focused on meeting people, like at least, you know, like you noticed the work that we're doing, the ICP that we're attracting and all that sort of thing.  you know, it's supposed to help us, you know, improve our pipeline. Yeah.

5:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, for sure. I mean, I'm very happy to jump into that, that part of the conversation. So I think I give you a little bit of context.  My father is as a company in Portugal. And I think I sent you the link. So you got five.  And I think the biggest thing right now is that this is totally like a thing of opportunity. As far as I know is not  looking for things. And I've been kind of teasing him about this because it's two years away from retiring and he built his whole network by going to industrial fairs in like Germany, France, you know, Netherlands.  And it has worked, but I've always felt that, you know, it's impossible that I understand that this generation is used to solving things in this way.  But I also think that there's new generations that are not spending so much time at fairs and stuff like that.  So that's part of the context. And in the past, me and my sister, it's because we're younger, she's not from marketing.  We're kind of pestering him like, maybe should, you know, do the marketing thing. And I think he had two or three experience, two for sure.  I'm not sure it's three. So the first one was like someone from our city. small seed they were not specialized right and I think they did like the basic let's put together website and and something like that and I think that got you know that gave them kind of a launchpad not really a strategy for using in a digital market just it gave them a presence I think but not right a process and I think later they were like oh we need we need to do this better and I think they fell and maybe this is a pattern they fell into that thing of you know paid ads guys because they are everywhere and it's like a honey trap and and they were doing ads and so on but I think they didn't I think you know these things go it's a subtle thing it requires adjustments and I don't think they got really happy with the results does he have a person in place in his business who

8:00 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Or your father is doing everything.

8:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Think there's three of them. I mean, there's there's two partners. Yeah There's my father and there's another partner my father is kind of like the Commercial is an engineer by training and so on but it brings the business in And I think is is more comfortable with Speaking Speaking French or speaking English and so on than the other guy.  Yeah, it's a little bit younger My father is 66. I think so he's like two years away from retiring.  I Mean technically he's retired retired, but it's stays working because my mom is not retired yet too much information I'm sorry and but but his partner is younger.  He's probably 48 something like that. I don't think it's partners For the business with your father retires. Yeah, they're thinking about that transition.  So that's That's a theme, right? But this partner is, it takes care, I think, more of the technical aspects, like the drafting, because they create, if you saw the website, they create equipment, right?  They don't really design the equipment. They mostly get the designs, and then they do the things. But there's always an element of adjusting and figuring out things.  So as far as understand, there's this there, the two partners. And they are kind of training in a third guy that has been with them for a little while, but seems to be energetic and motivated and could be like the future.  Also, there have been some conversations about the acquisitions. They were not looking for this specifically. Yeah, sorry, a dog scratching the door here.  I have a cat, and I know how he is. And sometimes you'll see like a... the tail crossing the camera.

10:03 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Go, go, you can go.

10:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So these acquisition conversations popped up and in my mind. So my, the reason for my pausing right now is this.  As an external observer, I can see that doing something with the marketing could increase valuation, right? But I also think, but at the same time, I'm also like, how much should I share with you?  Because my father doesn't know that I'm telling you these things and I don't know how it would feel.

10:42 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  But I'll just share because, well, if it doesn't go he know that we're talking? Does he know that we're talking at all?  No.

10:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  will tell him this weekend. Because previously, whenever I tried to introduce these things, these ideas, it leans towards the skeptical.  I think I need to make a case for it, you know, and so the perspective I'm thinking is marketing could help with the valuation, right?  And this is a very opportunistic thing because they were not, you know, trying to increase the valuation or anything like that.  But, you know, having pipeline and processes for that pipeline and so on surely affects our companies, look at it, right?  So that's, I think, the main context. I spoke quite a bit, maybe you have some questions.

11:36 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  No, I'm trying to get as much context as possible. know, I find it so amazing that you care so much about your father's business that you're making this link for him.  And I'm really fascinated by that. you know, our program is designed to specifically help you know as you noticed like our ICP matches exactly what you're looking for and we have a number of clients all over the world that match this sort of technical sort of situation as well and what we have found generally is that many of the clients that when we start working with them they're stuck in kind of an old sales process model where they're very heavily reliant on their sales team to you know cold call to create leads out of nothing with no sort of backup and no system but the problem is a lot of competitors are entering the digital space and they are sort of showing up when people start doing their research online because it's not the old days where just meet somebody off the street and you make an introduction and it's a referral based sort of sales growth and you know  pipelines are drying up, if you're not in digital, you're not going to be found. You're simply just not going to be found.  So where is the difference, right? So the process that we go through is what we call the 10-20-70 framework.  And what this means is we do an evaluation of where things stand. Ten percent of the effort starts with an evaluation of where things stand.  Twenty percent that is, you know, how do we improve situation on backline, so optimizations, such as planning. And then we really focus on the program, honing it on the results and making sure that we're not doing ad, we're not just do content, right?  We're trying to put clients in the best possible places where they can succeed. supplier or as a provider. So that might mean specialized networks, schools, and programs.  But what we try to do is tie it all together and learn how the program is affecting the quality of a lead.  Are we a track-and-write buyer? We've had several situations where we're hired to do work and we realize that the company's process for generating leads that match their own ICP is not aligned.  We try to figure out where the disk is and then we start pushing people toward a program like a test.  that attract right buyer, that's the right buyer based their hand, and then blow up that program. So I hesitate to call it lead generation because we're not lead generation specialists.  Business growth specialists who specialize helping you connect with your right buyer, okay? And a lot of it stems from the fact that, a lot of organizations from a sales process point of view are stuck in a very old style sales process.  And it's 2025 and you would think that most companies have turned the corner to more of a digital first process, but I'm still shocked by how many companies are just not ready for that.  So like we'll evaluate, website will evaluate landing pages. We'll see what the status of your CRM is if you have one.  We'll see what the status of the tools in your marketing toolkit are and we'll try to make them all connected so that we can get data centralized and learn from the program and moving forward.  Does that make sense what I'm saying? It does, it does.

16:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So a little bit of a little bit more context in terms of how my father has been approaching this.  It's very funny and frustrating as well that sometimes we have these conversations. So I'm not in line for succession.  He probed me around that. I'm not going to run the companies. It's not that scenario. But we talk about things.  And one of the things that usually So because of this stage of his life, like two years away from retirement, he prepared really well for this.  I mean, he would like to sell the company, but he wasn't even planning on it. He just became a granddad.  His priorities are not, you know, extreme in terms of, I need to do this right now. And when you say a program, I understand what you mean.  think it's, to me, it speaks to continuous effort that is not a one-shot thing and so on. Because what you need to do to get these sort of results, I understand that.  But sometimes when I talk to him about, I don't know, LinkedIn, he says, oh, I need to find a guy to do my LinkedIn for me.  And I've told him, like, that guy doesn't exist. That guy is you. But that guy, if he's that good, he's doing that for himself, right?  And it's funny because like I've introduced him. the chat EPT like the week it came out and was like oh this is amazing and it was like I need a guy to use this to make my LinkedIn so like and so my my thing is like I mean I wish uh sincerely I wish like we find a way to make this work because I think even for in terms of this my perspective I'm not sure if it's the same perspective as this but even in terms of you know it's just a pride of living the thing in good hands and I think that's that's interesting so but you're your dad has a partner he has a partner yeah who can quite end up who who may or may not end up owning the company and running it himself to some degree and this is just how I think and this isn't a judgment it's just a discussion

19:01 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  There's an obligation to not put the brakes on because your dad is going to retire. The company is going to last for as many years as possible after he retires.  I'm sure that the partner would have a vested interest in making sure that his program is modern and effective in terms of growing the business.  I agree.

19:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And they do have this sort of loyalty. Because when the first conversations around selling the company came up, which were maybe a year ago, at the time my dad was like, I'm ready, but if we sell the company, this guy will be out of a job and he's too old to get another one, but too young to retire.  So I totally agree with your point and that's a very good angle. So, we could perhaps explore that.

20:04 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  think my main point... you have a personal relationship with his partner? No, not Friendship, anything? No, no.

20:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've met him... The company started, like, when I was already in Brazil. So, I've met him two or three times after we're not close.  And they are friendly, but they are not, like, you know, personal friends. They have a good working relationship, but they don't live in the same city.  They don't do other things outside of work. But I do think that that angle could be interesting. I suspect the partner does not speak English.  I'm not sure. I can investigate this.

20:41 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  You know, to me, it's also to appeal emotionally to your father. It might be about legacy, right? Leave this company in better shape when you leave it than it is now.  Not that it's in bad shape. But what are people going to remember about how you handled the transition, right?  Was it sort of, you know, I don't want to use the wrong terminology because I don't know you, I don't know your father, right?  No, we are thinking it with a pencil, so it's fine. You can say anything. Like, you know, I know some people, and I don't get the sense that this is your dad, but I know that some people sort of throw it in the towel, and they kind of mail it in, right?  Like, they're going through the motions, they're counting down the clock until they're, you know, sitting on a beach or they're traveling with their wife.  And I get that. I totally, and I, you know, to some degree, like, I can totally understand that. I'm 52, but I'm always thinking about retirement, right?  But the point is, is like, this is a company that will survive his departure and his retirement. And I think it's  think there's an angle, again, I don't know your dad, but I think there's an angle in saying, you know, dad, you got to start thinking about your your legacy or leave behind, you know, are you, are you gonna leave behind the company without its without its head, right?  To have success. Once you're out the door, and you're not participating in day to day activities. For sure, for sure.

22:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think that's that's an interesting one. Also, I think it creates another possibility, which is like, we're not selling the company.  But we have created a way that doesn't require my dad to keep traveling to fairs, right? It can, because, because even if if the deal falls true, they still have stuff to do, or deals there.

22:47 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  this is also and it's also not just about not never going to another trade show or fair. It's, it's about what do you do after you come back with leads?  Yeah, So we work with clients who go to two big trade shows every year, one in the U.S. and one in, well, it's actually in Spain.  their whole marketing budget is spent on these two shows. So much money. It's so much money. what do they get out of it?  They come back with a booth scan lead list, a CSV file, right? And their whole year is predicated on what do you do with this list?  Yeah, yeah. Because it's so much money to acquire those names. Perfect. I'm totally sold.

23:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So just trying to be mindful of time also because it is not a sure thing for you. What I'm thinking is what can I have some questions for you that I think might help me build up a case?  So, let's see, do you have case studies or things like that? Given that is a...

24:15 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Yeah, I am currently working on a couple of sort of like positioning papers or leave-behinds or case studies and I'm traveling all next week with the client to do some video content shooting.  If you give me until the end of the week of the 31st, if that's okay, I'll give you some materials to follow up with.  No, perfect.

24:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I speak to my friends every week and it doesn't have to be right now. And actually, in June, I'll be there physically, so don't worry about that.

24:57 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  I would love to say I'll be there physically in June. Also, my wife and I are overdue for some travel, I got to tell you.

25:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think today is Friday. think yesterday I was talking to someone from Montreal as well. Oh, really?

25:17 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Agency person?

25:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Kind of, but it's different. I can introduce you. His name is Lyndon, but it comes more from the PR communications area, and it was a different conversation.  It was not about this, but I spent decades of my life not talking to people from Montreal.

25:44 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  That's cool. That's very cool.

25:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I had some questions, but I think some of them your website clears, like what are the agencies get wrong?  Or what do they do difference?

25:54 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Yeah, there's actually a pretty decent FAQ section on the site.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think one of, one of the questions that I didn't find straight up is not a problem with a specific question is what's different not from agency but about this market.  Because what I'm thinking is like arguments that I can use that, that he will see himself and that's, oh yeah, that's true.  That's it.

26:25 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  I think he'll, I think, I think what will happen is when he sees our case studies and he sees the process that we put together, he'll see himself in that.  And it's funny because I've just spent the last two days going back and forth with David on building those out.  So if you, like I said, I think that content will help him see his own position in there. For sure.  So once it's ready. I mean the answer is the same. Honestly, don't want to say this in the wrong way.  But the program that we're running is, in many ways, it could be applied to B2B companies of all kinds.  The difference is our experience. Because our experience is with industrial material suppliers and companies that sell to manufacturers or build specific to spec for manufacturers.  That's how our team has been fine-tuned. So to me, that's the real difference.

27:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, that ICP, that's what made me immediately send you a message. One question that you will ask me for sure is some sort of ballpark figures on investment.

28:08 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Listen, I can't, I can't ballpark it, no problem. We have clients who are paying us $7,500 US plus media, right?  We have other clients that are paying us up to $15,000 to $20,000 US per month, right? And it depends on the media investment, it depends on how much of our program your budget will allow us to implement, okay?  But generally what we try to do is do the assessment and what we ask for is some kind of project fee to do the assessment and then coming out of the assessment we say okay you're going to get a plan and we're going to put a whole plan together and that plan is going to cost ABC but if you can't do the  plan or you're not ready or maybe we phase in, we phase up the program and then phase in the billing growth.  We're pretty flexible and we do generally come in cheaper than a company that would be United States located because we do our costing in Canadian dollars and then translate to an American figure and right now that's a 45 percent difference in exchange rate.

29:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay final question, that's project fee, can you both market?

29:50 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  I'll say around 10k US a month okay, give or take you know. Yeah this is not a promise. Yeah, it's a ballpark.  key is the client also needs to fund media, right? And the media portion, you know, we have, we've managed media budgets of anywhere between a few thousand dollars a month to, you know, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousand dollars a month, it depends on the scale of the company.  Usually in the B2B space, the media is kind of capped. What we try to do is make partnerships with trade publications specific to the industry.  We do search programs, we do generally LinkedIn programs, and we look for directories that are relevant to the trade.  So, you know, if I do some quick back of the napkin math, right now one of our clients is running a program and the allotted budget, and we might not even spend it all, to be quite frank.  It comes out to about $15,000 a month and it's a pretty comprehensive program. On media or on the whole?  Media alone plus our fee. So this client let's say is spending about $30,000 a month between media and our agencies.

31:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. So I don't think they're at that stage but this is useful and I'm very motivated to make them you know.

31:35 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Yeah we're motivated to make it work too that's how I can say it. I'm not going to lose money on the time that we spend on the account so it has to be you know in the right ballpark.  But at the same time you know it's kind of you know I just be I'm I'm very trans. Right like if we if we get a lead and it comes in and the client isn't willing to spend a certain number Then it's not the right lead for us either.  Mm-hmm true. Yeah, I'm saying perfect And you know But at the same time we're generally flexible. That's all I can tell you got it I don't want these whole entirely about price.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course, I got it. You will ask me about this Yeah, of course, of course And the number I gave you the $30,000 is a client that's running a very comprehensive program They're in a very tight niche and not everybody's in that situation either.  Yeah You know, it's a private equity-owned business that has a lot of different companies that they've put together So they have distinct divisions.  have distinct brands like there's a there's a lot going on But they're still in the B2B space and there's a limited audience for them No, perfect.

32:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Thank you so much. This is good stuff. uh, thinking of next steps. I'm going to put this in one page for myself.

33:05 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Would you be able to share your fathom recording with me? Yes, I think you'll get it in the email.

33:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

33:46 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Okay, I was really great meeting you. You're an impressive guy, I have to tell you.

33:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. It doesn't feel like that from this side, but I appreciate it. I've gone through that too.

33:56 - Mark Goren (10|20 Marketing)
  Don't worry, you overcome it. Okay, thank you. Have a great weekend. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.  Okay, take care. Bye.
