0:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if you saw it on the Slack channel, but even, yeah, I saw that, yeah, great. Was it okay for me to make that suggestion?

0:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  don't know if I will.

0:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What suggestion? For Ivan, just keeping the same schedule and even missing this one. Yeah, no, that's fine. I'll just send the message tomorrow.

0:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I also just sent a link to a Figma that I've been working on, kind of updating the one that Romeo.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  has made as we get ready to go to production.

1:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I know that tech team want to start developing the new policy management. So I just had a look at it a little bit.  I'm going have some changes and I'm wondering if Romeo is able to make some of those changes relatively quickly.  It's more like moving some box that I couldn't move. But I'm happy to share a little bit on it too while we're waiting for Mao.  OK, yeah, I think that's a good idea. I'm going share this with you. So this is the, do you see my screen?

1:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I see it.

1:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So this is the one that Romeo made, right?

1:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I just wanted to change a few things.

1:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  One is I think this percentage is like 12% is very, very difficult for somebody understanding what it means. So I think we should just delete the percentages.  And then instead of blue to use red to make it easy. red means you haven't started and then to kind of take away the percentages and just kind of put the icons in so just not just like totally plain and then yellow do the same thing and then gray because I think I had like not applicable here you know was gray here but then it was blue here maybe because of the percentages but I think it makes more sense to be kind of gray if it's not gray because it's not applicable so the kind of matches you know yeah matches some of these there and then to also make these colors match the other ones and then I've also broken down the sections more because right now you see this one whole section but there's actually going to be several sections one called company wide policies one called internal documents and then new policies and then one that creates new ones and then ideally this one I put it here it should be moved to the right bloodline with the intro text ideally it should be moved over here but I don't know how to move it because it keeps getting stuck over there so those are  of the main changes. I don't think it's going to take very long because I've done a lot of it, just more maybe adding a few more line spaces between the sections and then like I couldn't figure out how to, yeah, like some of these are kind of sticking out.  But Romeo, I don't, you think it could be done pretty quickly because they want to start on it tomorrow?

3:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But right now, as I understand it, and please correct me if I don't have this right, there's some stuff that it's been worked on, right?  There's the update, the design to show how the policy review looks on the pop-up and changing the info sidebar on the policy section.  Maybe I don't know if I, I mean basically from my understanding is those changes seem to be relatively easy.  It's just a matter of do they overstep other

4:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Other tasks are they and I guess it's also like the like the availability of Romeo too, but I yeah, I guess I could understand because I'm trying to like this is I think quite important for for the launcher, but I'd like to understand what are the other two that are being done because there's like those two main like four tasks, right that we're.

4:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you want me to share my screen with you. Yeah, sure.

4:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Share content and screen.

4:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you should be seeing it. I don't know what the zoom level on this. Okay. So yesterday, while talking to even we have organized things to make sure that we have a single source of truth for these tasks, which is the geographic right now, right.  So the idea is that even if requests come from different ways will always make the effort of. and taking those requests and putting them here, so the development team always knows what's happening.  So right now, these things are in progress, these two things, which these are related to requests for more clarity that even made yesterday, and also maybe because these things, they don't have a screenshot, I can show you a screenshot of what they referred to, they are related to the four tasks that were negotiated on the Slack file.  Do you want me to show those things? that be helpful?

5:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I guess I think I know what they mean in both sidebar and policy section,

6:00 - Mau
  That one.

6:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not sure the modal one, but I know the bottom one. Yeah.

6:09 - Mau
  Also, I'm trying to open the mirror. Ux.

6:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Just a second.

6:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going share this tab. Okay. Okay. Okay. So those tasks that came through the select file, right? We brought them here and then they were the basis of our discussion yesterday with Ivan and Ivan asked for some more design work to make it really more clear for his development work what needed to be done.  And we created this, not with these names, we just use descriptive names. We've created these things on the gira, right?  So this task number one policy, it refers to this thing and this thing. Okay.

6:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And so basically my point is I think I might be going in circles here basically my point is is a request you you've made for policies now uh they're probably within the realm of possibilities for sure but it's just do they take over other things like new sections and things yeah are they and guess my question is I agree and I guess a question is like how much time does Romeo have allocated to us and how much time are the in progress ones going to take and like in the estimate of like of the task you know it's the two days so then he has an extra day this week to do this or is it uh you know because I am a little bit I guess my concern is like if we had someone sitting next to us like who's like allocated three we could just kind of like keep throwing tasks but then if we have to wait every meeting every day for a meeting to add a new task and then check it is and see if it's like allocated within these timeframes of the other ones it kind of slows the the the progress

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  down so I guess you know for this it's in progress but like when do you think I guess Romeo's like when do you think you'll be done with this so then yeah we can see if this tax can be added to it but my estimate I think from those tasks that we see at least one like it shouldn't take too long so but it would be good to know because if you think it's going to take one full week and we'll be built one for a week for this and then we can't start that until next week that's another discussion I also need to better understand too so it's like yeah yeah we can definitely I see your point so we will have that discussion about the allocation for sure we can do it now we can always add the test that you suggest as we're not the resistant to that the question do we add it to the list of things that need to be done and pull it at the front of the list or we just add it to the list and assume  This one test is then we're moving to that next test, you know? So we can always add this. Oh, and I agree.

9:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think it also depends on like also better understanding of like the availability and then like the the timing of how things are, right?  Like if this is going to end up adding, like if like there's no time, like, and I guess it's like, like, you know, I guess my, well, my changes is like the development team is about to start.  Like, is that what changes that I showed you, which I don't think are going to be a lot. And I'm thinking it should be able to be done in less than an hour, or even less.

9:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, you know, can that be done quickly? So then the development team can start that and there.

9:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But if you're saying like, you know, that's actually going to take two hours. And then now we're not going to be able to start on, you know, this and the, and then this stuff that's in progress is going to take a week because, and that could be a week because Romeo is not available.  You know, and like these, like, and then that's why it takes a week or it could be that it is just 40 hours of work to do this.  I think that's what need to also better understand two in terms of how to allocate the time and the budget and everything for this.  I do feel like, and I think you heard that on my call, it's like a little bit frustrated in that.  I know you guys are working, we're always trying to coordinate, and then we had the first 15 days, we're hoping to get a lot of stuff done, but then because I'm not able to get in touch, and then I know some forms are made, but those weren't totally the right forms, and then we got the right feedback, and then we had to do another planning, and then we had that.  It's been a little bit slower moving than I've been hoping, I'm trying to, and it's also hard to understand how much time is allocated to each, and who's available when, and what work is being done towards that, and like, yeah, so that's what I'm trying to figure out there.  So got it.

10:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first thing on the case-by-case basis, your first question is these things that are on the doing. when will they be done, right?  And then we move on to the second level, which is about allocation, correct? Romeo, do you think you can me a of when you would compute the tasks that are in doing?  Okay. Don't listen to Okay. Romeo, are you there? Okay. So let's, while Romeo logs in, let's move in.

12:00 - Mau
  to the second thing.

12:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you asked about allocation, I believe the agreement was allocation, availability, especially for the design work, right? To keep it always on place with this figure of stuff.  Is it halftime though?

12:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is he using like 20 hours a week on us and our design work since we started? I think Amal just dropped he had at least said that not all the times were used, but that might have been your time and his time.  My time wasn't for years. But has Romeo been working 20 hours a week on us then?

12:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am not tracking Romeo's hours, but my hours were under the estimation.

12:54 - Mau
  Yeah, could you have said that like, yeah, no, Mal, you had dropped off and then you all had mentioned like our agreement was that wrong.  It was going to work 20 hours a week and and I think we had agreed that in the start, but I'm I'd be it has been working 20 hours a week since we've started because I know that you had mentioned Joe was under and Joe just confirmed he was under.

13:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But like, has he been working 20 hours because then that's also surprising to me based off of how many designs that we've had it were like, if he has been working 20 hours a week, but these are the things I would like to confirm.  Because I don't know if it's also allocated 20 hours a week, then then we should like have a lot more regular check ins and it should go faster.

13:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah.

13:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, now it's not working. OK. Mal, you're going to have buy a phone with a wire.

14:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear me now?

14:10 - Mau
  Yeah. I hear you.

14:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Did you hear us?

14:16 - Mau
  Or like when we were talking? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think the whole thing we discussed on Monday and then we started with Ivan as well yesterday.  So we designed a little bit of a process about which tasks we consider that they are very simple and then we can do a quick estimate.  So I think we are going to go everything to direct and I think if you can show a little bit of the process.  I think when you have a new request, I think we can summarize simple, build and, you know, long term based on, you know, what you think, what you know about the platform, what you've run, those about the platform, and then we can accelerate more easily.  So I think that that's a way of doing things and moving things faster. I'm not just to find the last couple of weeks, but we have, you know, holidays in the middle, a little bit complicated.  So we designed this process here to make it and faster. So we can go through this, you know, more in detail, but what we are doing right now is just like estimating all the tasks that we have before and two or three of them are already complete.  We went to that, we did on yesterday. I think that's, that's the whole thing, the process that you want to speed up.

15:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's one thing.

15:57 - Mau
  So Romeo is available. to work with us 20 hours a week as mentioned before as we started in November.  So I'm going to send you the hours reports for December for us to agree what was being developed or not and during this period.  But the thing is we got you what's your point and then we established this kind of a process here and we are going to move faster.  especially allocating the hours, delete hours for each test. I think it's important for us on 12 when it comes a brief or a new request, a little bit of context, what to do exactly which is the process, the deadline and the level of complexity.  I think every time that a request comes to us, I think those four points should be at least one sentence or something like that.  So we can organize everything on gyro. I don't know if you think it's a good idea how to make it.  once we got on gyro, it could come from email or something like that. I think we need to agree with one channel to make the requests.  That would be faster so you are in the same place. And then once we get this, quickly draw more meals while going to evaluate if it's easy, how much time do you need, if that deadline is okay.  And then we validate with you, oh, that's okay. That's fine. That's how many hours we are going to spend on it.  And then we do that to decide. But this is not going to be a process that we are meeting or a daily meeting for that.  So this is going to be happening. Because I'm a little worried that we have to do this in every daily meeting.

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  my realization of like, it's like, are we doing this because also like Romeo's English isn't good enough?

18:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like in the past when we've had a UX UI designer, I can just go to Pinar and be like, can you make these changes?  And then she can understand it. I don't need to go through jail to go through, you know, Romeo to get set a deadline to set a thing.  And at the same time, it's like, if we have to go through, and I'm happy with this process, but it's like, we're such a small place, we just shouldn't need to like, have to explain, like, go through things.  And then by the time it's like one day later, and then we do it another one, and then the day later, by the time we get like, you know, are you able to tell me right away, this is going to take 10, like five hours by looking at it, or do you need to debrief and have another meeting with the three of you before you come back and tell me it's the three hours before we can have another meeting to say whether or not we proceed.  So I think that's like my little bit of my concern of like, are we making this more complex?

18:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think Romeo is right now like in it, but I think it's good that we go through jail. I think it is good that we have

19:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  but a place where all of the design things are there and we prioritize them. So I totally agree with that.  I think it's more about like the availability and our ability to move very quickly on some of these things.  Romeo, I don't know if you're back online now, like you know the picture like and Mao you haven't seen this because you came late but I can show it again and Romeo can look at it again too.  So like for example I was going through this because we're going to be trying the tech team is going to be updating the policy one which you guys created which I never gave feedback on because I granted I didn't have enough time and I was still like working on a lot of things.  Since then I've come back with it and it's few changes here like the color changes so instead of you know blue I've changed it to here but I would say more of what I need help with is that instead of those zero to 13 or 10 percent just change it to the colors like you're either you haven't started or you're in progress it's non-applicable.  Or you're okay and I just need like kind of formatting on some of these because they wouldn't move and then ideally move the policy thing button over here and then maybe add them for a line spaces and maybe clean that up.

20:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's what I need done.

20:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like, I don't have to have it done, but I think like the tech team go, but like, like this part, I'm sure that they would appreciate this part is updated.  You know, my question is how long would it take Romeo to update this, you know, and to me, I think it would be under an hour.  Or I think it should take not that long, probably even less, but at the same time, then like, I don't know what else has played and if Romeo is going to say, okay, it actually takes five hours and I might be like, okay, no, I don't want this.

20:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, like, so these are the things that like, I would like to like better understand.

20:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then at the same time, then Joe was saying, okay, well, we have this other stuff on the list that, you know, we said we're going where's the prioritization and it goes back to the same thing.  It's like, okay, well, those other two tasks, is that three days? Is that two days? Is that? Five days and is it because is it five days because Romeo only has half time or is five days, you know, because it's like, you know, Like, you know, actually full five days for it.  And I think these are kind of the things I think we've lost track of it over time because like, when you're saying like, he's been allocated 20 hours a week.  I'm like, really? you know, like, what are we, what are we doing with that time? And we need to be on on top of this a little bit more.  Yeah. So it'd be good to like, Romeo, how long looking at, you know, this, like, you know, changing the box colors, maybe, you know, on this compared to before, I put the link so you could also look at it, you know, comparing it to before, you know, how, and I've changed the text on it.

21:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you don't need to take the text, but like, you know, how long would it take to make these changes?  Rumeu, question of the app was looking these differences here in the screen. How long do you think it would take to fix the file that has already to move, the auto layout of the Figma stuck?

22:16 - Romeu
  So, in the end... Perfect, João.

22:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I understood, It's more visual, right? It's visual, and the thing about the line inside the app is that it in the Figma, but it's very visual.

22:31 - Romeu
  It's a little more on the bottom screen. Can you zoom in on the lower screen, Abby, please?

22:40 - Mau
  I sent a link, also, the links in the chat.

22:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Perfect, João, that's it.

22:45 - Romeu
  Just a suggestion of two hours at most, so you can adjust and leave according to the lines and the sounds.

22:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, there two things.

22:54 - Romeu
  One is how long and when are going to do it, okay?

22:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now you're to explain how long takes and then we'll how long it takes. This should be like a two-hour work, two hours for this task.

23:06 - Romeu
  Now it's just a matter of I have those nostrils on the board, I also put them together and get these here too.  So I think I can clean the two that Ivan answered, and also that one on the side. And also this one that Ebi suggested here, from Visual.  Okay.

23:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's it.

23:27 - Romeu
  I know.

23:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So good news, Ebi. The things that are currently on doing, they will be done today, Brazilian time. So you will wake up with them done.  And this thing could also be done today.

23:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then everything could be done by tomorrow then? Yes. Yeah. Okay. No, that's good to hear.

23:51 - Mau
  Okay. Because I think it's also like, because I think then if I get up by tomorrow morning, my time, then I have time.

24:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If you send me the link, I have time to make comments and make changes by the next one, right?  Is that kind of how... Because I know that this one that I showed you, I just noticed that on the JIRA box, you have it marked as complete, right?  But I never gave feedback on it, just because we never had time to really go through it. And it's nothing to you guys, it's more of a delay on our side, but it's like when we mark things as complete, then we should make sure that they're done in there.

24:37 - Mau
  Yeah, I think that's my point about everything. when it's just quick fix, we know already that, you know, it may take two hours or something like that, which is more design and the colors and everything.  So I think we may have three categories of, you know, some kind of request when you do... is not a new design for example.  So I think that you can have a better vision about how much time it doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna do that day but you know it's gonna go to a pipeline of requests but you know that you know we are spending one or two hours half an hour eight hours or something.  So I think it's from our side to make these clearings differently.

25:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah I think it could be good to like yeah I think we need to be a little bit clearer kind of where like you know hours and allocations and different things and what's being used but I think as we produce more then you will start to see it a little bit more hopefully on that and then we can see if it works in this progress in this way but then yeah because and then it's the same thing it's like I don't know  if there's like even in between right like now we're waiting a day which is a lot better than you know a week that we were waiting before but like is there anything that Romeo has like halfway done now that I can like look at that would help me him like not like know like like not like you know like give him feedback halfway so that it doesn't like you know you don't end up going down the wrong route it's kind of like when you did the forms right you spent this time on the forms and then like it was like not the right thing to wait a day to like kind of give it give feedback for it like is there anything like points you know if there's like allocated like set hours that are set up we can have a touch point and then give a feedback before that you know one one day later and then if it's then it's another day change a day later and then another change a day later you know what I mean this is the thing it's like if somebody's sitting back and forth they could be like checking at lunchtime and be like oh are we on the right check do we need to do that right but I feel like we haven't had that and  And we can see how tomorrow goes at the day checkpoints and see if that's, we got now that we've asked for more information to, you know, and the new ones that it's clear so that Romeo's be able to go, you know, a start.  Maybe that will make it easier than than before, but I'm not.

27:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But does that make sense?

27:19 - Mau
  like what I'm trying to.

27:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Yes.

27:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, go through.

27:28 - Mau
  No, I think that's okay. And you have already a process that you like before, when it was in our maybe a very quick conversation.  Let's think about that, because of course, now we all know this is the open space. You know, Romeo is not necessarily able to speak quickly, you know, if everything comes from, you know, general comments or something like that.  I don't know exactly how you have worked before with Pinar, so do you have a call or you are just...

28:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah Pinar we would have a call she would call me if she didn't understand things and then she would ask if things on the right track and we just like ping each other and we'd have calls.  Sometimes we just huddle, other times we had also regular sink ups that we would have but oftentimes it'd be like is this like you know she starts thing it's like am I on the right track and then I could either tell her yes or no you know and then she continues to go and then kind of fix it before it goes you know totally sideways in that sense.  So we had we definitely had more sink ups than we have we've had now you know in the way that we've worked and I think that and I'm realizing we need more sink ups especially as we get closer to like kind of launch that we need to get this in place and we need to kind of get there there so  So yeah, so that's what I'm trying to figure out, you know, if it's possible to find a way to have better touch points or did I also think it's writing, it's it's hard to so it's like, I don't know.  Yeah, I agree with you.

29:13 - Mau
  Yeah, yeah, I don't know if right now I think we need to discuss internally as well after this and come back to you to a quick answer, you know, either.  With this process Let's just think a little bit more.

30:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because I think that, like, unfortunately, I'm the subject matter expert on this, so then, like, I have to, like, kind of go in and spend time on it, and then, like, announce, like, okay, I haven't spent as much time on it, so I like, all right, you guys just go again, but then as we get closer to launch, I'm like, oh, , like, this isn't totally making sense.  Oh, we need to, like, change a few things, okay? This is, and I think the framework is there, but we need to add a little bit more direction, we need to add a little bit more clarity, and that's where it would be great to have someone sitting next to me.  I could be like, hey, I just realized this, you know, Romeo, can you go into here and, you know, look into this thing and then, you know, see how you would change this part here, so then, and then, you know, whether, like, I need a little bit of flexibility, like, around that part versus maybe the longer-term planning part that we can look at, and I think that's where I'm realizing, like, you know, like, these changes here would have been, like, nice to be like, or, you know, like, different things, like, and I've seen some of these before, but it's like, oh, it's going to take so long to  explain or whatever you know I'll do it later but now it's kind of getting to the point like okay we need to get this done you know can you get this done here and then and then there but then and then yes and then also if there are issues or not understanding to get it like quicker rather than like you know like with the like with the questionnaires things you know like it didn't totally go as I was hoping and that we'd have it like you know the 15 days I was gone I thought we would get like farther on that because there's some kind of communication misunderstanding on how those questionnaires would look so and what was needed for them so like you know some of those questions that come up quicker before we show it and then yeah so that's just kind of some of the thinking so I think that yeah I'm trying to figure out how to best do that but I think it's great if you can get this part and then the other two parts done so that like you know that we can get it tomorrow and then we can have a discussion in the next meeting but and then like talk about the next task  So that's at least positive there and then we could see if this like kind of pace works for like what needs to be done, yeah, done there.  Like even like I guess we don't even have one for training, do we? Because we've been just, the development team has made one for policies and just copied it across I think.  But yeah, I could probably create something for that. But these are like kind of things they keep popping up as we go.

32:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think these are like the challenges.

32:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  not sure how to capture all of this and how to get this as it's going.

32:38 - Mau
  But yeah, okay.

32:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are there any other questions then?

32:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like, yeah, even on the stuff that Romeo's maybe started now, he spent, like, I don't know, we started talking about it on Friday and then now Monday, like Tuesday to Wednesday since had like maybe three days to work on it or two or three days to work on it and then so.  He's going to come tomorrow with it.

33:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does it make sense that I look at it before it's kind of closed?

33:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Or are we going to have another one that it's going to take longer because we haven't had as many touch points about it?  And that's kind of some of the thinking. I had to use like three full days or three half days on so far.

33:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And some of the understanding there.

33:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But yeah, we could discuss it more. Yeah, not on Friday mile, but like, yeah. Is there any other questions or any other thoughts on this?

33:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have a task that I'd like to get a little bit more clarity on it. And I'll just share my screen with you, and maybe you can help with that.  I'll share it here. OK, so this is greatest checklist for that task management in audit, right? And you spoke about this to Romy, right, in an email.  It's easy to understand what's a checklist. It's not completely, I'm not completely sure on where exactly would this go.  OK, it's inside of audit, but it's where in audits. It's in within the management review section for audit.

34:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then it could just be like a box checklist on it. I think this is like bare-bones minimum kind of thing, like not really like big design.  But it was meant to be like some place within the management review. There needs to be a design of like a questionnaire like this to check that you've done it.  So it wasn't meant to build the whole workflow of it because we haven't done that yet.

34:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  haven't sat down with you to discuss this.

34:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But it was more like in the meantime, while we're waiting for everything else, there are several checklists or questionnaires or everything that's  need to be done so if we can create those first and then like see where they go within the tool or how they're how we enter it to find it within the tool.

35:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm just looking for you know taking advantage of us being here on the same call. Yeah. Trying to find a figma.

35:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't think there is a figma because I think I wanted I don't think Romeo created one so this was taken from chat gbt like kind of an example of a what is needed.  I put in all of the different information that we had all of the documents that we had and then they kind of organized it into this.  So there is nothing so it's a simple checklist like I'd ask how to be the can you get a simple checklist so I just wanted like a designed version of a checklist.

35:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So I'll just share my screen and I understand this is this not the right design we're just drafting something together basically I understand what we what you're  asking you is let's say that it says audit here, like we're inside of the audit section. Yeah. And you have this checklist that you sent here inside.

36:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is this sort of thing?

36:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

36:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Or it could be another box that says, like, you know, checklist for audit, and then you click on it, and then you have the thing of that checklist.  But my point is, like, no matter what we're going to need a checklist, whether it's, like, two clicks down, there's a checklist.  You know, whether it's three clicks, one click, and it goes straight here, it's a checklist. So my thing is, like, while Zhao is traveling, and we haven't figured out the overarching look on that, no matter what, we're going to need a checklist design.  And the quicker that we have that design, the better, because we're going to need to have that made. And the development team could still make it a checklist on the back end, right?  But that will eventually need to go somewhere in the tool. So, but, yeah, I agree with you.

36:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The checklist is a primitive that we see many times in the platform. So it makes sense to know other checklists looks.  Would it be something like this? I'm not saying this is the done checklist. The checklist needs to be done.  I'm just thinking in terms of keeping up with the design consistency, right? Would the checklist be something like this?  It could be.

37:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm not really bothered, because it usually is a Word document, right? That would be in a Word document, and people would be like, x, I've done this.  x, I've done this. So whatever prettier design of x I've done this, it's fine. So if we think it should look like tasks requiring one, yes.

37:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you think it could be like the questionnaire with those boxes, yes.

37:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't mind so much right now. It's more like.

37:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, perfect, perfect. in this sense, OK, we'll make a checklist. There's no problem. Once we have a checklist, a visual defined checklist, creating the next one is not anymore for the future.  A design issue is just a matter of use for the dev team, use these components that you have already coded and replicate them for this checklist.  Then this stops being a bottleneck, which is probably a good thing. But this first time, it needs to be done for sure.  Yeah. I think some of the checklists are a little bit different.

38:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like from the ones that I had shown, the questionnaires and some are questionnaires, some are checklists, but all of them are like word templates.  People would be doing it on word and then they need, we want them to do it not on word and on a digital platform.  That's what needs to be converted and hoping to have converted not. We don't need so many steps yet, but it's more like here's a questionnaire that they need to fill in.  And then they need to like this is like basic. in the future we can like make it really pretty but it's more like how do you take this word document and then digitalize it.  So those are the ones that I sent to Romeo and Mal earlier like that.

39:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so we... Romeo, I don't know how much you spend on your hello?

39:24 - Romeu
  Yes, understand, I understand. Yeah?

39:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so... I'm understanding that part that you commented about the point of the day, right?

39:32 - Romeu
  It was in office of Audis Gentaria and then she commented that if there any change, she would something that, but what needs to be done, given to her in itself, of course.

39:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, what happens is that Audit will have a part here next to it, And it's a  that will be built and the first thing we're going put in it will be this checklist.  Okay, it's to be like here, not all of this style, not this style, but it's like here inside, okay?  But Audit.

40:02 - Mau
  Okay, we actually on Friday, we had a meeting. So, we had some of those forms ready. I then start a new process.  let's share some of the forms so I can look at it. Maybe we can see it now just to see if we're on the right track.  Cause I think the first time it wasn't totally on the right track.

40:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then I gave me back and then I haven't seen them since then. Is it possible to share on the screen?  don't know where they are. And also when you have it, feel free to throw it into the design, into the design Slack too, so I can also look at it and give feedback, you know, right away on this.

40:49 - Mau
  Jo, Yeah.

41:09 - Romeu
  more.

41:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Put the bridge.

41:22 - Romeu
  And see, okay.

41:26 - Mau
  Yeah, we put all the fields on a different way, so we just had to fill up some for you to understand what those tables would turn into this, so yeah, that's what we did.

41:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe we'll copy some of the fields, maybe we'll copy some of the fields, and we'll put them here, on other side.  Um, let's see.

42:15 - Romeu
  Uh, Uh, Yeah, those three forms that come, you know, you're going to enter the entire and then you can then now you can just go through that's not this line.

42:43 - Mau
  I think that's the process.

42:47 - Romeu
  Yeah, cause it doesn't totally match those forms.

42:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I give you to look at what what is required for stakeholder Nellis.

43:00 - Romeu
  Is it so this one is stakeholder analysis.

43:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If I'm looking at the wrong one.

43:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Interested party.

43:10 - Romeu
  Okay.

43:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Internal or external type.

43:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. This is not expectation reason.

43:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because this is an environmental like the data stuff in there is environmental stakeholder analysis is people.

43:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that doesn't match.

43:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But maybe there.

43:34 - Romeu
  Yeah.

43:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then, yeah, we understand that the landscape is they are a.

43:43 - Romeu
  Multiple languages ​​to get it.

43:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we are to do a specific.

43:50 - Romeu
  Connect to me.

43:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Choose one of them. Connect to me how the part of the table. So. the space in the design, please.

44:05 - Romeu
  Right, okay. Here, as far as I understand, both the Interest Parts as well as the type, the type, they are fields that we would have already if they were open fields.  And as far I understand here, the Ruison, the Expectation and Risk fields, these three here, would be open fields.  I'm not seeing...

44:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How do I look at your model? I don't know.

44:34 - Romeu
  I think I'm still not seeing it. So...

44:38 - Mau
  No, see it.

44:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You can drag these little arrows, connecting the table with...

44:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Thank I don't think it was like that.

45:03 - Romeu
  No, it was pretty internal or external these energy use.

45:07 - Mau
  Yeah, think there are a few things that are only in the Babagini social, I think that will need to improve our car.  So, the guitars will be brought down in a certain way, especially in Italy.

45:22 - Romeu
  That's right. All the information that you know are on the track, or they are not necessarily the right ones, but all the views are there.

45:34 - Mau
  So, yeah, that's what it is. So, now we can make comments on that. So, we can fill up with the right dropdown, or if it's multiple choices, or if it's just a text.  So, that's where you can help us, because we try to also improve some other GT3 quick answers how some other problems will be filled up.  And that's just like a placeholder for that. so something like that so don't it is more like you see the fields at the top and then what is written is not necessarily what you feel the pressure you feel up.  Okay.

46:27 - Romeu
  Let's see.

46:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

46:36 - Romeu
  Is this a better way of doing it? Yeah, definitely. It makes more sense there, but I was... I just...

47:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm just trying, I'm trying to think, like, are we over, I think this is nice, but I'm just thinking, like, if an auditor were to look at it, like, they're probably more used to the Word doc, the Word document.  And then, like, if they were to filter, let's say I want to filter by all your external parties, would it be easy to, you know, or maybe they'll have to, then if you're going make those drugs down, then maybe on top, there needs to be a filter button, you know, so then they could be, like, all external stakeholders, and then they filter.  If you're not going to have the filter function, then I would just kind of copy that exact table, as it is in the Word document.  know it's not the prettiest, and then try to, like, and then try to make it that way. I think it looks pretty here, but I'm trying, like, what is the functionality of, because the functionality makes it more difficult to review, compare it against the other ones, unless there's some kind of filter

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  abundant.

48:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Does that, does that make sense what I'm saying or?

48:08 - Romeu
  Yeah, I see what you're saying.

48:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, let me paraphrase to see if I got it right. People are more used to this thing, right? That's their daily experience.  When we make it this way, it looks better, but maybe because they're used to this, they get a little bit confused by this.  Is this what you're saying?

48:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and maybe if we want to keep the one that looks better, then we need to add some kind of filtering on top, like another one.  if they want to filter by, you know, external stakeholder, then they see all of the ones that are the same external stakeholder.  Could there be like, or like, or external or internal stakeholders, most likely the one that they would filter on?  Because the interested party, like stakeholder analysis, it would be like, if you want to go the simplest form, it'd be like Mao, Zhao, Romeo, that's like one, two, three.  then Mao is internal, Romeo and Zhao are external. And then, you know, and then you want to see their, and then so you want to filter by internal, external stakeholders, like, who is there any trend that my internal or external stakeholders have, right?  Zhao and Romeo are saying this, but they're both external stakeholders. That's why they're saying this, okay, into my internal stakeholders all seem to be saying the same thing.

49:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's like more analysis on it. So that's why it's like, if we are going to do the nicer view, then there should be some filtering on it.

49:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But if we want to do the simplest, fastest, easy, like, you know, way in the short term, like, just make a prettier version of what is already there.

49:45 - Romeu
  Got it. But I'm not sure if I got this right, it seems to me that we're talking about two different moments, right?

49:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One moment where we are, you know, adding information and then another moment where we are of consulting, consuming this, writing and reading, right?  Yeah. OK. So this screen is a writing screen, right, where we input more information. But this doesn't mean that the way to consume that information looks anything like this.  It could look like a table.

50:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's very easy to make it look like that.

50:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree.

50:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  think in the ideal scenario, it would be like that, right? I think I was thinking in the short and ugly version, how most people work right now is off of a Word document where they already see it, and they consume it at the same time when they put it in.  know what I mean? So yes, ideally your scenario will be correct.

50:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if we can build out the whole form and have that design in a good time, yes.

50:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I was thinking in short MVP style, where we need to like to get something out that the development team can make so that they can do the back end on it, then maybe this is a...

51:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  or turn solution on it.

51:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it's more like, like that thinking.

51:06 - Mau
  But from a user perspective, and in what are we offering, you think that, okay, they think it's easier and use tree, but what, what, you know, provides providing them for a better experienced person, you know, I think, yeah.  No, I agree.

51:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like the part of the better experience is that you're digitalizing a manual process, and you're able to track people and that, right?  So I think the number one part is digitalization. And then very close after that is the digitalization and the use and that aspect of it.  But it is like kind of the like, you know, and it goes back again, like how much time is it going to take, right?  If it's not going to take that much longer to get, you know, like, like, you know, the part that I was talking about the new frames and then that whenever a design, then yeah, let's do it.  In the meantime, if there isn't a lot of time and we just want to get something done so we can put it into our tool, then maybe the one on the bottom is done.  And I was thinking, given that we have time during the break, it's good to, I was just thinking, it would just be a prettier version of this, or somewhat similar of that.  So I think that's the question.

52:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I think there are three forms.

52:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Takeholder, environmental, and there is aspects of impacts. And then, yeah, so this is aspects of impacts, and then wasn't there a lot more form, I think?  Or is it three? Or is it only two? Maybe.

52:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can't remember.

52:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do have a family member with me?

52:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I a of family members, but we have four.

52:48 - Mau
  But we haven't got to all of them right now.

52:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah, maybe it was three ones, and then to check with you, and then we could keep developing that.

53:00 - Mau
  The question is, how long did it take you to work on these?

53:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because it hasn't been 20 hours a week to work on these, or is it like, and I know there's holiday in between, so it might be different this month, but these are kind of the things like it would be good to understand also just in terms of timing on these.

53:19 - Mau
  then I think that kind of having these discussions like sooner through the saying like, OK, that's great.

53:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If we're going to do this, then we're missing the next step, which is one that needs to be created, which is kind of the dashboard version of this, right?  And when is that going to be created? Or do we say like, OK, let's just make a pretty version of these Word documents so that then we have that just done.  Like if we really like, like my thing is like, OK, if we need to launch the product soon, like a digitalized version of that checklist, at least we have that on the tool, people can at least start using it and they can't copy it.  somewhere else, right? So that's kind of the thinking of it.

54:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think I understand the description of the situation, I'm not fully clear on the next steps. regarding these forms, your first question is how long does it take to make them look like better versions of the spreadsheet?  Is that the first question?

54:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well one and I think just for understanding on estimates, like how long did it take Romeo to make these two ones, right?

54:45 - Mau
  We have a complete register and I have all the hourly reports to send to you, then I have a two-year vision about not missing all the discussion.

55:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  before but how we make it so it can we can yeah maybe now we have a meeting scheduled because it would be good not just because if you just get an hourly time she's very hard to like allocate like it's like I can't say but like to really understand the tasks you know like okay this was like you know like which which hours went to which task so then we can also just understand kind of like uh like kind of usage of time and understanding that and and see if that makes sense um yeah and then we can go from there I guess but this is like why I think it could also be good like in this meeting to see the work that's halfway there and and that but I don't know like let's let's just have a meeting tomorrow and just see how it goes then and then because I have that actually pretty soon but um yeah and and then we go yeah okay okay but then you have the link to that that one and I'll tell the development team that you'll can you send that link tonight when  when you're done so that we have it in the morning before you start Romeo. So then they can start looking at it in the morning when you guys are offline.

56:09 - Mau
  Yep. We're also talking about the deliveries in the previous day and then we can make comments.

56:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah, we have been discussing that.

56:18 - Mau
  We'll do that. Okay, great.

56:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Thanks a lot then.

56:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right. We'll be in touch.

56:23 - Mau
  All right. Thank you.

56:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll never get there.

56:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

56:27 - Mau
  Thank you. All right. Thanks. Bye.
