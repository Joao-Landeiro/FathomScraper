  Is it just us, Yvonne, not joining? I sent a message on, I think, it said it was going to be five minutes late.  should be joining in a minute.

0:09 - A L
  Okay, great. Yeah, so, um, yeah, you saw my message. And I also added some more, like, text on, um, on, uh, um, as I say, okay, uh, on the controls.  Did you see that? Where did you add the text?

0:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the design section.

0:41 - A L
  On Slack? Uh, yes. Oh, okay. You mean the form? Yeah, I, you said there, like I was missing that form, that environmental form.  That's the text for the form. Mm-hmm.

0:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll paste it in the, in the GDAC. Thank you.

0:59 - A L
  And then I realized also missing the for the control around their asset register. I'll put it in also the design.  I'm trying to figure out where we put our documents but I'll put it in the design chat here. There's still a lot that needs to be designed on the control part for environment, right?

1:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have three forms and I think that's it, right? But that's it.

2:00 - A L
  It's also the process. It's not just the forms, right? It's like the explanation of how to do it, I guess.  Or that not included. You know what I mean? I was going to charge her. There should be like a one-page explanation.  If you think about the carbon, checking the carbon thing of your digital cloud, there should be some text or content in there, right?  Not just the form?

2:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. Which is the model of the in-between pop-up, right?

2:53 - A L
  I guess, I'm not sure. Yeah, I guess one is the content itself. We have to check it. test it and then the other one is like with the the carbon electricity and all of that stuff like do we have it like tested out that it actually works and makes sense and then like the forms and that.  So I'll share my screen now.

3:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So this is what we've designed for the reporting the clouds then Romeo started on it.

3:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, okay.

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then we asked him to stop that because the other stuff was more urgent, right? Yeah.

3:44 - A L
  Okay, but now he's starting on. But should we go through this radio on the call?

3:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hey. Let's start now, we'll get to him.

4:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Ivan, I'll start with what's freshest for me, this is something that Abby and I worked earlier today, and then I try to guide it up.  So third-party management, and there was some stuff for it, but there was not an end-to-end experience to it, and there were some blind spots, because they had not been designed, right?  And I'll just open the middle very quickly. And so there's a video for later. Let's not watch the video right now, so I can just explain what we're looking at.  Basically, so right now what you see is the third-party management as it is developed. This is like a screenshot from the real thing.  And so because the design has changed, we is how to create a new or an updated version of this page, right?  And there's the headers for this style that we've been using, this sort of thing. No ESG toggle. And then a table, much like this table.  Maybe the columns are slightly different, but the elements are basically this, right? And add a new third-party button at the top.

5:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  A key observation here is that this screen, this page you see, once your first time come in and you didn't upload anything, so once there are no third-party vendors here, then this page, the table is gone and then this whole page is filled in with the bottom part, just something to imagine.

6:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but for now, I would suggest we hide this thing and the empty state of the page, maybe something we need to design.  I want to transfer this to somewhere else. Basically, this is the idea of just the page quickly with stuff that we already have.  This is the flow and there's stuff in blue is the admin view. Most of the things we've been doing have been on the admin view.  The orange stuff is what the third party interacts with. The green is my attempt at understanding what data is flowing through this, right?  I'm sure it's not fully complete. Basically, if you add a new third party, we get this screen, which is a help screen.  It's kind of like this. content and you start as the compliance officer you start to fill in the form and we ask you what kind of third party this is just kind of the screen but it's not right and we need to put in some basic information about this supplier right do this each time for every new supplier or is this just the setup for each new supplier we need to get their data okay I don't know if this is processes going to work like that then why because you want to bulk send out a questionnaire to all the suppliers on the list right you don't want to individually add in all of the different things on them yeah but I didn't finish so maybe okay sorry so I need to know the name of the supplier and the email of the supplier at least to send them the form right so I need to I need to get like first level of just  putting a third party on the list, right? So I just say what they are. I put, this is the intake form.  This is not the third party management form. So I need to put some information on that, like name, email to them.

8:16 - A L
  to both upload those, right? We need to have some, like it won't work individually, because if you think about it, if you have 30 suppliers or 50 suppliers, to have to go in individually and write in the name or email, like most of them would be taken from like an ERP system or something that you would ideally put in the right format.  Sonora, I understand that, I understand that.

8:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But we're drawing V1, right?

8:42 - A L
  Yeah, but even V1 we had, like originally, the way Yvonne has set it up is that we have an upload function and upload the stuff into a table.  Okay. Current system.

8:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right, Yvonne?

8:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, like you have an upload, you upload the file, which has to be a specific one. And then that gets imported as vendors in our database.  Do we have that file?

9:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we have that structure? I don't know.

9:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  can fetch it for you. But let's imagine it can be something simple for the design purposes. can imagine a name, I don't know, something else.  So that file is usually Excel as file. think we support Excel file for now, I guess. And the idea was that for MVP we will help with creation of those files for our customers.  Because usually you need to handle lots of stuff if you are just allowing users to submit it themselves. Initially, we need to have a bad clutch upload.

9:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then as they have new suppliers throughout the year, they can manually put it in.

9:43 - A L
  But if we had to manually do it from the beginning, I know there will be outrage. Got it.

9:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Perfect. we upload their information, name, and email. That kind of thing. If we have this function, we will have to have a function of dealing with things that are wrong, okay?  Like people use the they filled up the wrong information they put emails on the name column stuff like that Yeah, and that's what we're thinking in the MVP version at the time is like we'll just like manually clean it up before we Upload it in there so that we wouldn't like everything would be perfect.

10:27 - A L
  That was what we are thinking So for the MVP so that for the MVP version, I would say they just send you the the file and then you internally Yeah, but they were the way in it in that in like that direction thing that we had in the original one It says upload the file.  Here's the template and then upload the file, you know But I think I think in in our MVP version we would check that the file is like  perfect and make sure that they get it in there. But the thought was that they would upload a file and then we would clean it and then make sure it works or it could upload directly in it if it didn't.  So I think that was the thinking. We haven't talked too much about it, so I'm happy to change the process if you think it's right.

11:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can I just interrupt for a second, sorry? So I'll probably tend to leave a bit earlier, like 20 minutes to five, so in like 20 minutes.  Before this, I think there is controls parts. Can we check if we have everything for controls ready? that's the next big thing that we are defining.  Sorry, I'm hijacking your plan, but just trying to see if priorities are before I have to leave. development, current state of development is as follows.  So we are completing policy trainings and communications, mostly finishing it up, wrapping it up. So in probably a couple of days, four or five days, we'll have to sometime meet at latest meet next week.  We'll have most of the things ready for testing on policy trainings and communications and the next question, what's next?  So the next thing is magic link and controls or submissions. My question is do we have everything ready for controls or if not then what do we need to do, what do we need to prioritize and that's it.  So before we go into all these third-party management stuff. That's a fair point.

12:26 - A L
  We just went through the third product today so it's kind of fresh, but I think yeah. Let's see like if Romeo has enough tasks for the control or how the employee needs to control I guess.

12:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. So for now we are just looking ahead towards the past, we're not looking at tasks that have been done, we're looking at the next tasks that will need to be done, correct?  on that Romeo is working on, Ed started to work on the carbon reporting for cloud stuff like the ML  on the Microsoft AWS kind of thing which I believe it's there's there's stuff already done here just uploading this just opening it okay so there's this this flow correct this is control are these controls or yeah this is a control for e like yeah it's for e because a lot of our g is already done but we don't have much of the e done okay um so these have been started it's actually at this point I think kind of ready for for review

14:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  João, in this task here, I remember that we took a break. Yeah, you wanted a... It's the same complex, right?  Each scenario had a different We had to retake this here. I didn't get it yet. I got it for the others there.

14:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what we here is to correct these things, right? That's it, exactly. Yeah, I've been working on it.  I attached a PDF right from my understanding.

14:27 - A L
  Which makes sense. think we'll do that. It also allows us to change our other directions if needed. said... Okay, so then that one is updated.  Then we're just kind of taking numbers from... Do you know which fields that we need to be able to...  Do you some kind of data analytics on it?

14:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the thing we've discussed together was... Because we don't know exactly how they represent things... So we try to collect just the numbers, the basic numbers and we have a way of setting the unit because maybe AWS represents these in some unit and some other company uses another unit.  So the idea is that the MVP for analytics is just knowing what's the amount for each one, right?

15:24 - A L
  Yeah, and then like, is there a visual of like, once you put it in the summary, it looks like that then?  Yeah, that's how the summary looks like. There's no graph or anything at this point, it just works. No.

15:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But this is, I mean, I think perhaps because of, you know, libraries and stuff like that, it's very easy.

15:49 - A L
  I think it's like a basic visualization of the cloud provider would be helpful, you know, like over time, like Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, that's already like something.  That's that's helpful, but it depends on how urgent our things because you know everything is possible Like like like or like a task right like because this isn't just once that they're gonna do it It's like ideally every quarter they get a task to review Like update your numbers like so they'll get a task every quarter to do something and then eventually that will be Stuff that they can report to the board like our quarterly numbers are this and then at the end our annual numbers are this So they should at least look at this four times a year Which I think is should be manageable with our directions and like reminder of it But what So it's not clear to me.

16:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's missing from this?

16:42 - A L
  I guess it's more um, one is like task reminders to Look at this again every quarter and then one is like you have a cloud provider.  You have like, you know right now You have google cloud here And do we just add something that goes q1, know, so then when q2 comes in  Q3, Q4 underneath, then eventually there's like a, then you can kind of see the difference, right? Because if you were to do this again, what would that 22.5 be, right?  Is that the first quarter, you need some kind of like, maybe it just needs to be another column that says which quarter it is or the date.  Maybe it needs to be on that column, like Google Cloud, date, total consumption, or last access, I don't know, last access or date.  And then eventually like, yeah, until last access it could be like date. And then you can filter it and then, or something, I'm just trying to think it's like, what would be helpful, right?  you just see a number, it's not really helpful for themselves, but if it's in like a comparison of every quarter and you see that it's growing or going down, you know, some, yeah.  That is easy to understand.

17:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The use case is very easy to understand. The point is, yeah, sure. Let's put a graph on this. Other things might, maybe we are spending time on the graph that we could use for  some urgent stuff, but we can put it back.

18:16 - A L
  I don't know, Yvonne, you feel like it's worth it to spend time on putting a graph or we can add it later?

18:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  The simple graph is not too big of a problem, it depends on the complexity and what we need, but to show just the simple data flow through quarters, how it entered, shouldn't be a problem.  That's quick, as long as we keep it simple for now, if we can make it pretty quick.

18:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My fear with this is that we will not stop the graph, right? Because the moment we have a graph, we'll start to think about the colors of the graph and how to export the graph, is it scratch?  Sure, we can do it, it's an easy task to do on our side, but given how much stuff there is to do.

18:58 - A L
  Yeah, I know, it's okay. We can, you can hold it accountable if I start asking for a thing. You can slide, digitally slide me, yeah, no, that's fine.  it's... So let's...

19:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  Zha, can I ask, this is, which state, this is working progress to this whole floor, right? I did not understand before.  Yeah, he's still working on it, because he's been working on the other parts first before controls.

19:25 - A L
  Okay, I'll give my feedback then afterwards.

19:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I'll ask about all these tiny details where this is situated in the app and so on. So I'll wait for that.

19:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's an E controls.

19:35 - A L
  should be an E. Like it should be the control part, then when you filter to E, or like however, I don't know if I'm going get rid of that filter part, but this should be there.  Got it. Yes, maybe you need to have an overall page, right? Because this is just carbon emissions. When you go into E, there should be one carbon emissions, digital assets, you know, ones, and then they each go to their own flow, right?  Yeah, I guess like because you know how we have it we look at the new the updated control like if you look at the updated controls for G the design for that it's like there's multiple controls with the description of each of the controls.  So that front page should actually be like carpet emissions and then all the other ones right to match for E.  Trying to get to it.

20:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which one did you say controls? Controls, governance.

20:35 - A L
  so this one right here, here, here.

20:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

20:42 - A L
  Yeah. So then you would have like so carbon emissions for the cloud should be one of these right with an explanation and then it goes into the carbon emission and then what the other one should be like employee feedback survey whatever and that goes here and then the other one should be asset management here.  And then the other one should be carbon reporting of the office here, right? And each of these go into the e-controls.  Does that make sense? Like, it's like a front page for all of the e-controls. Yeah.

21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, I think this would make the most sense with the table. OK, so it's easy to just change names around here and reorganize things and make this fit the controls thing.  OK, you can do that. that what you would prefer?

21:39 - A L
  I'm just thinking, so Ivan, Xiao had a point today earlier that we should also move some things to tables and filtering to make it a lot easier to do, right?  Like, later on, but my point was like, I kind of agree with that with policies, but we are so close to launch that, like, maybe we just launch with the current design.

22:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  but I'm all up for improving the UIX down the line and I'm all up for the new approach to that.  Depends on, I actually want to see how it looks in live because it's all nice when we draw it and test it with five holices and five ISOs and whatnot and I really want to see how many they have in actual and how that look once they have their own stuff and start working with it.  That's what I'd like to see and then I think we'll also know maybe how to adjust the UI, but I think table sounds like a good solution for this because they'll want to search it, filter it, all that stuff, you know, because you'll want to see which are deployed, which are not deployed, the search by name, search by reviewer, global, all stuff that all usually comes to a table.  yeah, it makes sense, but not now, let's not talk about it now.

22:47 - A L
  I'm putting some in the chat, Xiaoxiao, IT, ISO register. Okay, you put it on the slack, otherwise we'll miss it.

22:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, Yeah, I can add it to there.

23:00 - A L
  But yeah, so the question is, do we, in the short term, do we just update this, you know, one given that controls is coming up next?  Or do we say that, or do we say, like, use this as an opportunity for Romeo to, like, create a new design and then when controls, like, is there enough time and controls in two weeks to change it to a table format or better, that we kind of.

23:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  So the current state is, you go, if you go to the link of controls, sorry, to interrupt you, you're sharing.  you have the design channel, have, it's like I sent those three links. one of those links is controls. Yeah.  So basically, this is the current state of controls. So what we have. So basically, as you can see, it's old, old policy look.  basically that. So to convert it to the new look, same as policies is simple. To add it to the table is simple.  We have a table. But the issue I have with table is that our current table in the app is not the same as the design because we postponed that after launch.  So we didn't update the table look and feel. We just have a table component, which you use all over the place, but we didn't update the design for that yet just because we didn't have time.  So it is a bit more work to do, to do this one controls, but, but I really want to see what what's the old work that we need to do on controls.  Then I can say if we can have time for table or not, that's my opinion. So let's see what we need to do on controls, what do we need to change.  after that, I can tell you if we can, or if it's reasonable or not to maybe apply immediately table out here.  Okay.

24:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

24:52 - Ivan Ćelić
  So also a question for Abby. So when you click ES and G, then the controls page will look different or not.

25:00 - A L
  I was saying if we use that template that he just shown which is the new template for G for controls And then we you know we were to rename it and just rename the ones like e and I put the names of the controls in in the In the design on slack then it would be the same design right if we would do that Because you're going to update it to with the g on that new design that romeo already made Which matches the other ones and then you would just change the text for e and that would go You have carbon reporting for example, who does carbon reporting?

25:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  The carbon it depends they might Need to designate it to A person in the office and that's an e that's an e control And then when you go to e when you click e in the app, what happens?  Do they just see a one line where it says carbon reporting like single line like single policy line?

25:53 - A L
  Yeah then if follow the flow that gel Had possibly it would be like you go into that e carbon  reporting section and then there'd be like instructions on what you need to do. and I'm sure if we have that in their job now that I think about it is that in that design we need to be rescinded to somebody to fill in.  don't think we have it in that design for control.

26:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  And also our question before that how does ISO categorization uh how how does that make with all of this stuff.  So if I want to filter by ISO one to three how does it because we have ESG current yeah like yeah for E right now it's it's mainly um ISO everything in E is ISO the rest of them aren't ISO like you set up based off of ISO.

26:44 - A L
  Okay okay. But um yeah but I like I think shell's idea makes sense it's more that we don't have a design for it and if we're gonna launch like it's a better just to use Romeo's existing design and update it or is there time for him  to design it under what Jawa is picturing and then we can look at it and see like okay if we decide we want to move to that format then we can launch control.

27:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  I summarize what needs to be changed so we need to update the design for sure at least in one version in table or policies look and feel we need to update it because this is old.  That's one task the second task is to have controls split by annual and ongoing if I'm not mistaken they are not currently and one is the carbon reporting we need to implement carbon reporting that's one will be a bit specific is there will be anything else that's specific to to these controls that we need if you look at if you look at in the design channel I just put in all the controls for the so yes asset IT register the carbon emissions office which has been a really built but I think Romeo's worked on that carbon digital cloud the environmental improvement form incident reporting form

28:00 - A L
  document changer of quest form and these are kind of forms that like employees need to share all the forms right?  They're nothing specific but just um the carbon emissions office and carbon midget digital cloud is more of a step process because they need to go in and find the information the ic asset register it just like a it's like an xml you just need to log in assets so that you keep track of them and then the other ones are just forms that would go up in the employee portal we need to do each of them separately okay these three are okay I'll have to run off really soon uh so uh yeah so we have a decision we are going to redesign to look the to look it we're going to redesign controls to look a little bit like this right?  yeah I think we at least need that in the interim and it could be good I would say in terms of priorities get this one set up and then maybe focus on the e controls to make sure we  I have that designed more, like the carbon reporting and maybe the carbon emissions to drill clouds, because those are more on the forms.  then get those. And then we go back to redesigning this into tables if we have time and then comparing it.

29:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Honestly, I don't think we need to redesign the tables on Figma, because the tables are like these components that is really easy to just, the time it will take to redesign them on Figma could be better used on other things that are not easy to make on the code.  But this is a discussion for another time. OK, so you've got to go, Ivan, right? Yeah, I have to run.  I'll be listening in.

29:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  I just have to get ready. But yeah, my opinion, we need to focus on everything control. So let's get control turned out, because then the next probably comes in sometime end of next week develop and can start working on controls.  So in my opinion, let's start with controls. Let's work on controls. Once controls are ready. alongside then we can jump to the third party or whatever's next and then then we can I would like to do those in those iterations Yeah, there's no plan because we need to have ready for controls for development.  So that's possible.

30:13 - A L
  Yeah, that's that's next basically So then I think in the short term we could just update I think it'll be fastest to update this one to match like it right now and like and tables a little bit and then and then Build out those other e-controls that we have so those Those are being built then we can reconsider the table like I think yeah, I told me like I Kind of get the essence of your table, but I don't totally get it So that's why I think it would be nice to be able to see visually because I am a my only hesitation I think tables are good in terms of filtering.  I just worry about the UX UI design that you suddenly becomes a page of tables and it doesn't seem very interesting So I would love to like if Romeo has time like after we get through those for him to be Michelle like how could it  How can tables be a little bit more interesting than just a table? Is it the color scheme or is it where it's placed and there's other pictures on there?  think, yeah, that's my only concern about that part. Is it like you end up just having like every section, we just have a lot of tables.  And then we kind of lose some of the fun parts of it or something like that.

31:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it's hard to say without seeing it, but I would prioritize the speed right now before maybe some of these changes because the current I think is okay.  And maybe we can sometime down the road have a quick, I don't know, sketch or something and then we can decide if we want to go in one or another direction.  yeah, that's my opinion here.

31:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Yeah, I'll make a flow for how the controls probably work. Thank you. and we'll get to it.

32:12 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay.

32:16 - A L
  Then is there any, I I can stay longer so I can also look at like is there anything that Romeo's waiting for feedback from us that we haven't come back to?  Yes, yes, there's six things I think Romeo is waiting for. Go through those very quickly.

32:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So communications area, separate the stacks into key one, key two, key three, key four. And Romeo just cheated.  Okay, yes. Okay, this is the thing. That looks good. Approve. Done. Yeah, okay. And create color legend components for to apply to areas of color status.  So these sort of things. This means policy is to be done. It's going to be example done here. Okay.  Okay.

33:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay.

33:26 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay.

33:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  it's on it's on over time over.

33:45 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay.

33:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So right now if you click on the on the label, it shows the color legend.

33:57 - A L
  Okay. People click on it and kind of just get confused or get in. that they didn't mean to click on it keeps popping up, is it better to have that legend somewhere, like, permanently on the thing without a pop-up?  I don't have a strong opinion because I don't even know if we need it, but Yvonne, do you have any thoughts?  No, I think it's fine.

34:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  So it should definitely be a pop, but maybe optionally we can first time show it and then hide it afterwards.  Maybe we can have it something like that, I don't know. Not sure what's the best UX here, but I'd say the plastic of showing it once and hiding it afterwards for users, if they want, they can still see it.  Maybe something like that can be an option here. And then I think it's fine.

34:38 - A L
  I don't have a strong opinion. I'll connect from the front, too.

34:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think that's good.

34:44 - A L
  So, done.

34:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Create screens for approval process. She and this tab.

34:52 - Romeu Rodrigues
  That's great. Thank you.

34:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this was about the policy approval process, the basic idea. Remember, let's come here, share this step instead. Okay.  Tunnel latest?

35:20 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay, so made the updates in the comments, I put those models in the middle approved or not approved. Okay.

35:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I can need a code prover.

35:36 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay, it comes here, It's in manual momentum.

35:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the question from Romeo is that if we click on people, we show up or if we type. The emails manually and I think we have agreed on just including the emails for now Like they're pre-existing emails of who they're going to send it to or what do you mean or They can make our initial suggestion was that people should pick from a list but then in our Last sync when we spoke about this I understand that the agreement was that just put it in an email input form input field And just yeah, and I think it's fine like that too, whichever one's easier.

36:32 - A L
  It's fine.

36:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay Okay So after you click this Uh, her policy has been sent for for approval, but I can make air from you  Let's to Ok, let's go here.

37:04 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Let me follow you here too. It's in the flow. Sorry, sorry. I'll follow you for a minute. Here, when we click here, I didn't approve of the policy.  It opens and sends it down. It says that the policy has been implemented. will be sent back to... to create the policy.  That's And here, you the policy. So we got it here, even for here, right? Ok. So the policy has successfully approved.

37:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the email.

37:53 - Romeu Rodrigues
  That's same It was just this part here below. the solutions of all of them. That's it. What is this?

38:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just notice is the right sidebar and the edit should also be visible and not editing.

38:09 - A L
  The right sidebar. Yeah, like the right sidebar on edit should be visible, even when not editing. Yeah, like they you know that that bar that thing on the bottom that talks about the that thing on the right.  Yeah, that should be also visible when they're reviewing it. Okay, they could just be copied over there.

38:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and I believe that's it.

38:55 - A L
  Yeah, on that one. Okay.

39:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, cool. So, I'll set this to, Humeo, can you do that change now?

39:14 - Romeu Rodrigues
  He's ready.

39:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I'll set this to done because Humeo is already correcting it. That's right. Okay. Create a screen that appears in the foreign user opens a foreign policy training control etc.  Okay, that's the one that we were talking about, yeah. So, this was about just teaching people what's going to happen, right?

39:33 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

39:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, you see the policy manager. Thank you. Okay. And we can skip the tour, can never see it again, it's a nice touch.  Yeah, I like it, I think it's good.

40:09 - A L
  If they, let's say like they forgot about it, is there anywhere they can like find it again? Like, you know what I mean?  Like they, like they went and they forgot. Is it like, is there some kind of like help button? Like we're in, they can press it.  understood, I understood.

40:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So not on this version, but we could add something to that push it.

40:30 - A L
  I think it's good, but it could be good just to have like an info button and then like somewhere.

40:35 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I think we can use that icon on the side menu on the left, there, For these cases, So close it, on the left.  Oh, when the person... I can't pull it.

40:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Try to go back, sorry, try to pull it.

40:54 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Mm-hmm. He he is in the automatic see the platform, I it's easier because there no After Delay and he will never be able to show it, but that's what he said, about looking for a new way to find it.  Okay, see.

41:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then the old man said about it, put it there, don't show again, then how does he do it again?

41:42 - Romeu Rodrigues
  You can use that limit, help, it's down there, on the side, right? Okay. I guess you can replace the Lumina guy because that person was never created, or he could

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  put it at link there and then it can pop up yeah so my suggestion is to not use this place here because this thing is on the menu and the menu probably doesn't change so it's I would just put like especially for the MVP just like yeah info button or need help here yeah yeah I did that like something quick and easy because I think it's really pretty so to make sure they find it we can we can even have a floating button in top right top bottom right corner like some pages have just an example also idea if you if you like so see I mean so floating button which is always fixed position bottom right corner which when you click it something opens up can be like that don't have to it can be what you suggest so my suggestion I'll keep that suggestion here because we've been using like these headers with explanations and stuff like that so kind of teaching people that help is usually around this part so my suggestion is just to put a link there  It makes sense, it makes sense, it makes sense. Okay, if you had, how are going do this now for us to test how we've done it and take this out front, it would be fantastic.  Can you do it now, or? Okay, this is very basic, I think you can see it, but maybe this is more mission critical.  So, screens complete, complete, or sign up.

44:00 - A L
  OK, so this is related to this conversation, which is about the completion of sign up.

44:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the flow we've designed is like this. the compliance officer needs to input the email of the employee, or it's a batch upload thing.

44:22 - A L
  And the employee receives an email, there's some text on it, there's a button to complete sign up.

44:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This link takes you to the scenario where you can just confirm their information. I don't think it should be a pop-up, because it's a pop-up above what.  They've never been there, right? So I don't think it should be a pop-up. So they just confirm, yes, I'm João, yes, this is my email.  so they do not confirm anything.

44:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  They have to input it because on the invite screen, the only thing you input is user email and role.  So once they come to this page, only information we have is their role. which is not visible and their emails.  they need to input first name, last name, and password. First name, last name, and password?

45:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah.

45:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  For now that, but probably something more in one time. don't know now. Okay.

45:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So each new user will input their own data when they send up for the first time. Is that okay?  Yeah.

45:22 - A L
  Because we're getting the magic link then, right? then. Yeah. So magic link is two different things.

45:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Magic link is login and we are now talking about sign up. So this is the first time you come to the platform, you will need some more information about you, which is your name and your password, right?  But magic link is when you come back again after some time, so you're logged out, then you can log in via link.  That's two separate tips.

45:46 - A L
  are we not able to do some kind of manual upload? if we get a list from like Cognite for their 600 employees and we just log it up so that we have one.  Yeah.

45:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  Cognite, Cognite won't need to create. So initial test and won't need to create. We'll enter for them accounts, but later if they invite a single user, how do we know?

46:05 - A L
  mean, we can use this is fine and maybe for testing and maybe that's fine. But I was saying, yeah, for both uploads, we could just tell them like, we're going to have a broke up both function when you actually launch it.  So they don't have to do this every time. So yeah, it's fine.

46:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's also important to note. If you want to have more information before user comes to this sign up page, then we need to enter it on the invite dialogue.  So on the invite dialogue, then if you want someone else to enter it, then we have to do it there or do the bulk upload or whatnot.  But that all depends on the formatting and stuff. yeah, that's it.

46:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, just creating a new task. Okay, so yeah, it's an editable field. becomes empty. They have to fill it in.  They complete the sign up. By completing the sign up they should receive an email To confirm that they have we need to confirm that their email is valid right and they have signed up Yeah, yes, we don't have it right now, but yeah, sir I had the designs, but that should be that should be anything special So I complete the sign up Now this okay, I'll redo this this thing, but basically I make my name here and then I I complete and then I need to have a Confirmation confirmation like age age round you'll create a profile with the data.  Are you okay with that? Yes, I'm okay with that I click confirm and then I can see success and then I'm taken to the login page Yeah, I'm not yeah, I think that's fine Confirmation can be even a pop-up or something.

47:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't mind I just keep in mind that we have current login. So either we have to you design the current login or this should be in the same design language, I guess, right?  So that login and this page are similar, usually registration login, all those pages are on the same note, done in the same design language.

48:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, do we have those files from previously or just from library? No, I think, Abby, I think N did them, I think N did them, but they're actually really simple.

48:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  If you log out, you'll see how our login screen looks like, I don't think it's anything that you won't be able to quickly sketch, but if not, then I think there's a file in Figma where N did, but I just don't, I cannot find it, I already searched for it, yeah.  Yeah, okay.

48:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, my point here, I think, because this is just so easy, I think it doesn't make sense to spend like a lot of time trying to replicate things.  A screenshot and some notations works. yeah, that's fine by us, we don't need to complicate this one.

48:59 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

49:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, cool, so we've agreed on these steps and now I'll have to create this step for design, right? I can show you this thing, but I think this thing is more important, but this thing doesn't fit in our current time we need to go.  I'll there was this text, is a bit of an old task, the task text was to give people that have never seen the thing.  My suggestion is that we just make the text a little bit more generic, take away the greeting, simplify the title, description is a little bit more about what will happen at the page, that should be okay.  What is this for?

49:55 - A L
  is like, oh instead of welcome to policy review, video to policy review video. Oh, after the first time. OK.  Yeah, I don't have a straw. Yeah, I think it's good.

50:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

50:09 - A L
  So this is done.

50:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think that's it for the time we have. Yeah, I think this is good.

50:22 - A L
  then, so then now, then Rombo will work on the controls, start working on controls now, right? Correct. We have one V1 policy procedure, release of V1, policy procedure training.  What is that? FO, that purple one, the second from the left on the, no, not that, the one on the left.  purples are epics. Epics are the groupings of all the tests.

50:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, yeah.

50:43 - A L
  So then, no, that's OK. we have almost everything is done.

50:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK.

50:49 - A L
  Perfect.

50:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, then he starts on controls.

50:52 - A L
  And then we can follow up on the questions around controls. I guess around there. OK, perfect. And then we can spend more  I'm also going through your the third party but tomorrow maybe or one month yeah but I would invite everyone to watch the video because okay inside of these there's a video and then we can arrive at the discussion a little bit more aligned okay perfect okay it looks good a lot of good tests going so it's good perfect thanks a lot guys thank you
