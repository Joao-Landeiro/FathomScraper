  This meeting is being recorded.

0:04 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear me?

0:07 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Sorry for, I got an email saying something about the reschedule. I don't know if it was some sort of automatic thing.  And then I got confused.

0:18 - Patrick Kizny
  No, I don't think so. I don't know. How are you doing?

0:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. How about you?

0:24 - Patrick Kizny
  Let me just turn on the lights.

0:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's kind of coldy here. You've been in, uh, in, uh, having a lot of chatting to a lot of people, right?

0:35 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. That's my work now.

0:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's my work.

0:39 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah. This is cool. Although yesterday that was crazy. That was too much. And I lost it today. Yeah.

0:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So. Yeah.

0:52 - Patrick Kizny
  I'm looking at you. Lovely. Awesome. Awesome. I'm so handsome. Hey.

0:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Look. It's Mike, by the way.

1:01 - Patrick Kizny
  Thank you. It's a good old Samsung that I bought for recording music. And I'm using it right now for iPad.  It's good. I would love to keep it out of the frame, because I hate mics in the frame. But, well, not really possible, because the quality, like, I have a lot of reverberation in this room, so I really needed it most of my mouth.  I get it. So, anyways, here's one thing that I have in my mind.

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You remember I was designing this deck of cards.

1:41 - Patrick Kizny
  And I designed the concept. I don't have all cards, but the concept is there. And I keep it in the drawer, because I don't have sufficient amount of momentum and recognition yet to produce it and sell it.  And I'm not shooting with money. I need to be in a better position to produce it. Hey, are we still connected?

2:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Again, I think it, I heard I keep it in a drawing in the drawer because I don't have enough amount of recognition.

2:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, moment to me. Yeah. So, so it's there, but I'm showing it time to time to some some folks and here's here's an idea that I have.  We're a little bit in the similar business because Coincidentally, I'm seeing more and more consultants like like yourself or like Alex and you know experts and entrepreneurs, they're really interested in what I'm doing now or then the creative people running their creative firms.  But anyways, Yesterday, I met. So, excuse me, I'm a bit tired, so I'm processing slowly. That's why I'm saying we're in a little bit similar business, because you're helping run workshops, and I guess you're doing more things which are in that space in general, right?  I read you as a generalist consultant and someone who is quite savvy and smart and can apply, you know, you're thinking too many different things.  That's for super broad comics. Anyways, yesterday I was chatting with guys running quite old school business operations advisory in the UK.  And we liked each other, and they liked the stuff that I was showing to them. And it looks like I may be starting a project.  is not 100% confirmed yet, but they were quite enthusiastic about it. I may be starting a project where I would take their method and build a deck of cards.  So put this. method onto a deck of cards. But we also talked about some workshops. Because, you know, and I'm obviously I'm spotting a pattern, right?  People in consultancy, doing it a little bit old school, and they are bumping into the same problem, how not to be, you know, stinky dusty old consultant and how to make it more .  I mean, they don't have this problem, but when I approach them and I show them how cool I am, they want it, right?  It is good. So, here's an idea. The idea is to do it together and think about setting up an unofficial like slow, or excuse me, that's a bad word.  don't like this word, but let's say it productized this. and their experience, right? You're doing this with workshops, right?  I'm doing this with decks of cards. But anyways, there's a lot of people that have their IP, have their methodology, like every single consultant have it.  And it's sitting either in their drawer, or maybe they do a book about it, or it's sitting in decks which look like coming from the 90s.  So the idea is simple. Make your IP  and make your IP look good, make it, you know, more operational and put it on the deck of cards.  And there is a good reason to do this because if you put it on a deck of cards, it plays into the subject of marketing and go-to-market strategy.  all of a sudden, you have a gift that you can use to open doors. So more and more, I'm thinking about opening a business that would do a few things.  because it's making their expertise tangible and more . That's one thing. The other gap on the market that I'm seeing, and I'm talking about it with Alex right now, is something where you can start working with people that need to demonstrate their expertise.  think about thought leadership company as a super basic concept. So they have something that they are specialized in, but they struggle to put it out there in a resonant way.  So a deck of cards is one thing. A workshop is another thing, but developing a thought leadership program and equipping them with what Alex is doing, so a perspective and a messaging strategy, and then producing videos around that and delivering  Videos that they can start using in the internet or like conceptualizing a podcast that they can start Around that.  It makes a lot of sense.

7:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You see how all these things snap together Yeah, I think we're looking at very similar signals in the market.  So I spoke to Alex this week again, and we touched on some of you of these things and Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think we see the same Game board so to say For quite long time I had this idea of like starting a company that would Reduce videos for busy founders By producing videos.

7:42 - Patrick Kizny
  I don't mean taking a camera and shooting it I mean conceptualizing what they talk about writing scripts developing their perspective their messaging and then hiring people locally that would shoot it Maybe setting up podcast.  Maybe this or that so these are all very adjacent things and I think that all three of us have quite strong complementing capabilities to do that.

8:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, it feels like that. Thank you for thinking of me. What do you think is Okay, me more about how you see this like happening.

8:26 - Patrick Kizny
  That's just a broad idea. I'm not going to drop everything and bet on this business and kill everything else I'm doing.  I think it's a good side business for each of us, meaning that we can keep doing what we're doing, but have another thing that we're doing together.  And so that's a broad picture, broad perspective, but super practically, I would like you to tell me or think how much work or time or effort  that before you to take someone's expertise and translate it into a deck of cards and a process in the workshop.  And I don't mean design, you're not a designer, are you?

9:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am, but you are. Okay, yeah, but it's not what I want to spend the most time.

9:23 - Patrick Kizny
  I am a designer by trade and some stuff I can like I prefer giving creative in our direction, but I can do stuff myself.  Anyways, we're talking about conceptual skills right now because design, it's easy, we can outsource it to someone or we can play with that together.  mean, I can do that for sure. So, have you done stuff like this? I guess you haven't, right? Because for me, it's really difficult to estimate the amount of work that I would and the process that I would need to spend with the client in order to make a deck of cards.
  ACTION ITEM: Prepare examples/case studies of previous card game/workshop designs for potential deck project - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/x18zUQgZ6YY3bJ6yw6FVoNzfEFkGTGm7?timestamp=596.9999  not only a good, super near but also being a good operational bag for workshops.

10:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've done it yesterday. So when I quit my job, the first thing I did was I created game about product management, which is not exactly the same thing, but there was a systemic dynamic approach to it.  And just yesterday I was doing the same sort of thing. It was kind of a roleplay engine to practice nuanced work situations for a client.  So that intersection of cards as a vehicle to store variables that you use to practice something. I really liked that and I think I figured out some ways of doing that.  Like I always start on spreadsheets and then I Export the spreadsheets into illustrator and mass generate every every card and because they start in the spreadsheets There's a logic behind it.  I mean, I I Don't think Yeah, I suspect there's not lot of people that are into that as I am So yeah, that makes sense also just yesterday.  I was It's so funny You know notebook notebook lm from Google. Yeah So I fed it's all my newsletters And I asked it what's my method right and of course it doesn't go in one shot but that's a really interesting way of Like understanding what what am I talking about even if I don't say it explicitly?  So yeah, that intersection of making expertise legible creating games for me that are creating visual assets. think it really speaks to You  with this like cautious body language. I think I'm I don't know if this is like a side thing for me if it's my main thing.  So yeah, I think I have that in my mind. But so to answer your question in terms of much time to capture like someone's method, I would say that you need maybe three to four sessions.  And it depends, it needs pre-work to level everybody up, because some people really struggle with talking about what they do and they never done it before.  So three to four sessions, I think you get a map of what they think. And then you need more like two, three days realistically.  to convert that into a set of tables and variables that connect to each other? If it is to be dynamic, because there's like levels to this, right?  What do you mean by dynamic? So if you have just a list of concepts that they use, this is very easy to make because the cards don't interact with each other.  It's just like a reminder, oh, oh yeah, customer centricity, you know? If you want the cards to interact with each other, like whenever you have customer centricity, you usually also have customer research, because now you're connecting cards, right?  And then it gets more and more complex. If it is just converting like their main concepts and frameworks into cards, this is relatively easy.  If you want to create a system that runs on cards, then it gets quite more complex, and it's useful to test them out, like to see if they work.

13:58 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, yeah, totally. I totally see what what you're saying, but the angle I'm approaching this with is a little bit different, because you remember our conversation about my deck of cards that I showed you this stuff, did we talk about it?

14:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we spoke about it and showed me the deck.

14:18 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, so one of my key decisions was to offload the huge amount of structural information into the process on my role or something, right?  So the cards are detached from each other. They can go together, are maybe suggestions of usable related cards, but deliberately I made a decision to strip it down from structure, process, and all this kind of inter-relational things that connect the cards together and make it a playable system.  So it's like a bag of business blocks. And the reason I did it for my system was that first of  call I wanted a nicely designed product but at the same time I didn't want to repeat the mistake of PipDex which overloaded cards with information so like starting point for PipDex is so  there is a steep learning curve and I didn't want it and the way I'm thinking about the role of cards in this entire mix is that for a consulting company it's a product it's the first product it's a top of the final product that is used to open doors with the client and to get them familiar with the methodology they work with you see what I mean yeah yeah so it's not something that is meant to capture the entirety of your expertise into a workable system this could be a separate product for for someone who is serious about this method.  and doesn't love the workshop or stuff like that, but the way I'm envisioning the product right now is more of a marketing tool and introductory thing.  It's a start. Think about it as a starter.

16:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, makes a lot of sense. It's of uncanny because just yesterday talking to somebody else, I was like, I think that my thing of the workshops is not the entire workshop, it's probably the first workshop that I need to do, which is the workshop where people can demonstrate their expertise, right?  Which I think it relates to the aspect of the cards, which make expertise tangible, right? So it's really uncanny how much we see kind of the same sort of trends, and a lot of everything you're telling me makes a lot of sense to me.  So, yeah, I think the vision makes sense.

16:59 - Patrick Kizny
  So, graphic details, design aside, give me two figures, one figure, yes, two numbers, one figure is what is your minimal or cost or whatever amount of money that you would do something like that, the kind of deck of cards, assuming that we're working just to build the first case study.  So I'm not asking you to provide work for free, I would probably sell it to the client, but I need to have a boundary, I need to understand what are our costs, so what is the minimum we can produce it for, and maybe we can sell it full commercial price, maybe we just do it as the first case and do it as a, you know, on a cost basis, right, or like a small market.  But I did the lower estimate and I'm going to do it with the same with production cost with printing and with my work and everything else and you know we just need to come up with an idea of pricing the project like that and then the second thing is like what would be your commercial rate for something like that.

18:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking that the minimum amount considering like the the the translation between because it's not about creating a system of cards right it's just making the cards simple but collect capturing what the person.

18:55 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah it's you need to design you need to design a deck which is. encapsulating their expertise, not entirely, but it's inspired by their expertise and their methodology so that we can print it, produce it for the client and deliver as a gift, as a marketing gift.

19:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I would also be part of the meetings where we collect this, the framework.

19:22 - Patrick Kizny
  Of course, it's all on you. I mean, I'll probably join this meeting, but I'm asking you about taking the lead on capturing their process, consulting on their process, translating this into the idea of a deck, then outputting, yeah, and XLS is fine because then I can fit it into InDesign and operationalize it in InDesign, merge it with a template or whatever, right?  Or illustrator.

19:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The number that comes to me is for the whole process is

20:00 - Patrick Kizny
  is 2,000 bucks on a cost site. Gotcha. And commercially.

20:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. What do I mean, it's difficult to test this, but. I don't know because what I'm thinking is to be very transparent is like, okay, so if we talk about commercially, I start to think about like value pricing sort of thing.  it really depends on their capacity to make their investments work for them. So if they were really competent about it, then you can go higher if they are just trying to get like a thought in the ship book sort of deal.

20:58 - Patrick Kizny
  That's a good idea. use it. Compared to the like ghost writing. Yeah, how much does it cost to have a ghost writer write and produce a book for you?

21:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's like 10k to 15k.

21:10 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, that's that's the That's what I have in mind.

21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm The book of course I mean Including type setting and like editorial design but excluding print Yeah, yeah, I'm assuming that's what they whenever I look at ghost writing That's how far they get they even get up to the point of like ISBN serial numbers sort of thing So yeah You

22:02 - Patrick Kizny
  Cool. That's what I'm thinking. And that's a fair price, not including a premium for, because of the fact that it's   and it's a premium product and it's much better than, you know, a book, right?

22:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because then I think that there's an aspect to it. Which is kind of like the go-to market of the deck, right?  Like the kind of pictures you take, you know, all about this stuff. Because if you make it super nice, but then they are still in the square face, they have now a  thing, but they are still square people talking about the  thing.  I could imagine that the premium approach is like the whole go-to market of that product.

22:48 - Patrick Kizny
  That's right. And that's, and this is exactly, well, so let's call it an expertise to market or something like that, right?  That's why I started with plugging it out. like stuff because the way he his framework would like your perspective is your product and having a well-defined sharp POV, this is something that will be helpful, right?  You do this for them and then you do this product for them and then you provide them with like marketing materials.  Okay, here is a deck or here are the advertising materials for the deck, meaning a nice trend or a nice with a piece of copy with a post that goes with it, all this kind of stuff.

23:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the whole thing, mean even maybe the online shop, yeah. No, I can definitely see that they need that for sure.  They might be at the stage because selling a deck of cards that talks about your expertise by definition cannot be divorced from your own perspective, right?  It makes no sense to hire some paid traffic. 22 year old in Miami.

24:03 - Patrick Kizny
  No, no, no, absolutely. And the primary use I see for the deck is to use it as a fuel for social media storytelling because all of a sudden you're doing something interesting and you have something less boring to talk on on social media, but also you have a fuel for your go-to-market strategy because you have a gift-based marketing, right?  So, selling this deck of cards, I think it's an afterthought, right?

24:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, there's many things that I like about that also. So I really, I'm really interested in the whole physical aspects of thought.  I have a whole bit of on that. And so that's, that's cool. And also, like the other day, I have a picture somewhere.  The other day I bought deck of cards from a Brazilian guy that makes like And I think that's his only product that's his thing, which is a very smart product, because every professional needs to know about cognitive biases and the whole experience of getting the thing was very well made.  Like you get the box in the box outside it doesn't look like much but then inside there's something, there's a whole experience aspect to it which is which is great.  And I got pictures of that. So I've been on the receiving end of that. And I was like, yeah, okay, so I'm excited for getting this stuff.

25:38 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, and this is exactly the way I'm thinking about it because, you know, if you look at PipDex, this guy talks about like not taking sacrifices or compromises in terms of how it's produced, but come on, it's badly designed, it's produced in China, the packaging looks .

25:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not a premium feeling, right? Yes, I think you have one, right?

25:58 - Patrick Kizny
  You have one. No, I don't have one, but I've seen in how it's manufactured. You see it on the pictures.  Comparative. Have you ever opened a fresh iPad boxing packaging or iPad? So you see it's incomparable, right? It's a different class.

26:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, for sure.

26:24 - Patrick Kizny
  And also the way I'm thinking about it is I'm thinking about it, like in terms of making a design statement, meaning, you know, the PIPDEX packaging, okay, they tell story because they have this like characters and it's cartoonish and all this kind of stuff.  So they are selling a world to some extent. there is no design association. Like you don't think you have a of it as of a designer deck of cards, right?  It's more for kids.

26:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't know about that. I mean, I see your point. Maybe it's just a matter of. different preferences in terms of taste, but I think it's very recognizable what they do.

27:06 - Patrick Kizny
  It is recognizable, but it's Jesus, it doesn't scream premium to me.

27:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but then I'm looking here for stuff because I think I'm opening my Pinterest.

27:20 - Patrick Kizny
  I started thinking about the packaging and how I would execute it. I only spent 10 minutes on this today, but let me share you my pin board.  Yeah, I'm here.

27:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm still here. Just not just looking for the right tab.

27:36 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay. You Okay. Take a look at this. I'm sure if you can open this paste. That's the first one, but I also wanted to send you this one.  Which one are you opening? The business cards? Okay, so the business cards is so it's just a production technique.  This is a business card I designed for myself over a decade ago, but look at how it's manufactured. Like you have this duo layer glued together sandwich using black card board and white and you have contrast in all these design details, right?  Today this is more, today is not not, I mean the design is still good, but it's not so novel.  But when I did 15 years ago, that was like my book. Anyways, look at the the other board that I shared with you on Pinterest.

29:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This thing on Pinterest, I'm not sure if I'm seeing the right thing because all the things I see look my things and there's like Pinterest show error through.

30:06 - Patrick Kizny
  No, deck pack, it's a board called deck. Maybe it's because it's private, I don't know.

30:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If it is private, I don't think I'm going to open it.

30:18 - Patrick Kizny
  Can I share this ?

30:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so difficult to know because I save a lot of those things on Pinterest. I think I'm looking at my Pinterest, but but I think it is my Pinterest.

30:32 - Patrick Kizny
  It's called deck pack.

30:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, yeah, it's not what it appears to me. think it's not.

30:39 - Patrick Kizny
  Can you share your screen? Look at this. Look at this, maybe.

30:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Still, there's an error.

30:51 - Patrick Kizny
  I think this is a private thing. Okay. Yes, you were right. I need to change settings. Secret. . secret board, edit board, not secret, okay, retry now.

31:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, there's the line green, black box, yes, which are saved because of my color, and then you have this yellow with a ribbon, and there is all these like slick black things which are with UV printing, and there are these beautiful sliding curious things or the added as animated gifts.

31:48 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, yeah. So you can see the direction I'm thinking, right?

31:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  More designer kind of feeling, right? Yeah, let me share my screen with you, this.

31:59 - Patrick Kizny
  Again, this is not a Very deep research. This is something that I just started sketching.
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/x18zUQgZ6YY3bJ6yw6FVoNzfEFkGTGm7?timestamp=1926.008866

32:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, wait up. This is the thing you sent me. What do you see now? So, are you seeing like something with a juice box here?  Yes, yes. I'm seeing yours here. Okay. yeah. mean, there's a lot of inspiration, I think, in these onboarding packs for new employees at startups.  I think your thing was a little bit more high-class in terms of like the finishing. I really like this one.  It's probably expensive. It's probably just for the pictures. But yeah, I think we have kind of comparable, a comparable view of it.  Like look at this, is cool.

33:15 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, what is this?

33:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is like, it looks like a medicine, it looks, yeah, it's spices, like single-use spices.

33:25 - Patrick Kizny
  Cool. I mean, it looks nice, but I have an ideological problem with that, because it's plastic.

33:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, Single-use plastic. Yeah, but sure, yeah, I agree. I think we have a similar view of the way to package expertise and to make it look like a  product with all the best things we know about selling industrial design, selling ideas and marketing and stuff like that.

33:59 - Patrick Kizny
  Exactly. So, you know, we have a similar baseline and, you know, when I talk to people who have like 30 years experience in business operations and, you know, these are the PowerPoint deck, guys.  You know, it's an entirely different world, right?

34:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  presentations look like . Yeah.

34:27 - Patrick Kizny
  So, even doing it on a, like, a very, very basic design level, meaning not going crazy fancy, just doing a good design is going to be a huge jump for them, right?

34:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

34:44 - Patrick Kizny
  And, you know, this was striking for me yesterday, maybe you want to give me your opinion. But let me, let me share the link a few good people.  Yeah, I go to a few good people, CO UK.

35:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Man, I do not like zoom, why do I press it, it doesn't open the whole thing, stop here. A few good people you say?

35:15 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah.

35:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A few people.uk, let's see how, let's see how, let's see I think better, let's see these names somewhere, we help agencies, well brands, product companies, productization, yeah, product thinking, yeah, I agree with this.

35:46 - Patrick Kizny
  Okay, but even if you don't look at the content, but if you look at how they package it, what do you see?  You see a lot of Bibles style text, right?

36:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bible style meaning like very short.

36:04 - Patrick Kizny
  Bible is the Holy Book, which is which has a lot of words inside. Tiny print, fine print, paragraphs and paragraphs of text, right?

36:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I do see that and also it's the typical like consulting firm blue sort of color. So I do see that.  I do wonder if this is just a bit of like the most advanced yet acceptable sort of thing. Like if they go too crazy, maybe the boring companies that they serve.

36:40 - Patrick Kizny
  Look, I didn't invent it. We were we spent four hours on calls yesterday, quite insane, because I just get to know this guy yesterday.  But anyways, we had a first call about one and half an hour that we did another one for one and a half.  But anyways, I was showing them my stuff like this. design the new design of my website and the scorecard, the assessment that I developed and the decks of cards and all this stuff, all this kind of stuff.  And like, you know, there are jokes on the floor and they said, man, so good design, so good design, this looks so awesome, et cetera, et cetera.  So it's not that I'm trying to impose something on them, they are seeing value in it, right? And of course, not everybody's going to be like that.

37:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I mean, for sure. And that's, yeah, I see your point. I mean, it's not about just, you know, you want to laugh?  There's this book called Productize, maybe you've heard of it. I think the book is quite good. Their website is like a waterfront, it's  awful.  Look at this. The book is good, okay? But the website looks like

38:12 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, and you know what the point what problem they have Like when I met this guy yesterday, he gave me like 20 minutes intro of his background and following this 20 minutes, he concluded with what he's doing right now and that it's productizing services, but for 20 minutes, he was talking about how he has learned product thinking and everything related to product design through, you know, major massive corporations don't know this , right?  so the expertise is there, they are very well grounded and they are like really solid. However, the guy you were talking to is from this company, and the problem is that there is so many people talking about productizing your services these days that unless you have like a really catchy bold opinion or perspective, like, you know, Alex style, you're lost.

39:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I agree. You're back to square one. You need to keep, know, outreach and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah, I agree. I agree. Which is why, I mean, is funny. One of the reasons I talk a lot about workshops is that I think that workshops do not come across as competitive for most of the other people I talk to.  It depends on an angle, it depends on how you introduce it and how you lead with this.

40:06 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, but my point is, for instance, give me a sec, I need to change my setup and go on a chair.  I'm here, I moved to the standing desk, and like after three days of standing, I'm  dumb.

40:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Our ancestors invented chairs and tables for a reason, but let's not throw that away.

40:57 - Patrick Kizny
  So then these were a stupid friend.

41:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me figure out the phrases. What I'm interested in is like this thing you're talking about, like learning expertise, tangible, making something out of it, right?  also just, it's really interesting just to make a map of how people think that's a fascinating part of it, right?  So when I was thinking about how to position myself, I mean that is the thing, the broader aspect that I'm interested about, right?  But then I feel like I have no experience on that. I have a lot of experience on workshops, but I have no experience in productizing expertise on a whole because it's an entire world of things, like is it courses, is it like, there's a lot of things you can do around that.  So I remember thinking like, I know workshops. Also, because it's so specific, it doesn't feel that I'm competing with my peers when I meet people, right?  So, I can talk to people that I also prioritize, and we have very open transparent conversations, and they don't come across as me trying to sneak in or trying to extract information from them, because my circle of my area is like very specific, it's workshop.  And I think workshops, as the right side, the right amount of zoom level, that there's a whole lot of things you can do inside of it, but also doesn't come across as, oh, just another guy trying to sell stuff for consultants, you know, because then the dynamic gets a little bit weird, like, can I trust you?  I share this video? first point. I mean, clearly there's something in the market. I agree with that. I think we see the same science.  Clearly, there's interesting work to be done. Like, this is interesting work. This is fascinating stuff, right? And we have like a network of people that are really good at specific parts of that whole thing.  Do you have like a vision? too much of a word, but like, what do you imagine this thing could be in a year, six months?  A year is too much, like six months, three months.

43:43 - Patrick Kizny
  Man, in three months, he will do nothing. I didn't thing and like, start it out loud. This is not the way I'm thinking about it.  I'm thinking about it. really organically, because my experience over the last two years is that I've designed a bunch of brands for businesses that I wanted to start, and none of them got traction.

44:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I know the feeling.

44:18 - Patrick Kizny
  Because I did rebrand my studio, which then crashed. Then I did hypergalactic the space brand strategy and creative business, and this didn't take off.  Then I had another idea for a media brand, which I designed the name for and a lot of cool stuff.  was called Blind and Obvious. A wonderful name by the way. But anyways, I gave up on this and that was a good decision that I killed it, because it was built on, it was meant to be built on the content production and content production on social media is so  unpredictable.  that that's a suicide, meaning given how how social media evolve. And then I have my future crafting right now, which I've been working on since April.  And maybe I'll find a fine first client in a week or first two clients. But it's like going so  slow man that I've never seen such slow business in my life.  And of course, this is a huge shift for myself because this is not transitioning from film to animation or from video to commercial or whatever.  This is a transition from like doing to thinking and establishing my personal brand and establishing myself in the consulting circles, building my entire network from scratch, etc.  So given how market is  right now, it's stupid to expect that you will close the deal in a couple of months from the first idea of the business, right?  But it's frustrating. that is going crazy slow. So the way I'm thinking about this business that we would do together is that anyways, I'm doing business development.  And because I want to, I still want to try to focus on advisory for creative firms, I'm doing a lot of connections and conversations with peers in the consulting area.  And I'm entering these relationships from like quite high trust level. And because I'm doing that, like totally organically yesterday, this subject, you know, appeared, and I didn't go chasing clients to sell them a deck of cards, right?  I was having a regular conversation about, you know, consulting in the agency field. And it appeared organically. But there will be more and more opportunities like that.  And the reason I recommend that you here and there is that I'm seeing these opportunities. And the other thing that I'm observing is that I'm getting much more traction and much more buzz when I'm talking to consultants, even though I'm quite new as a consultant.  I have never worked as a consultant. I've been doing consulting half of my professional life, but I was never a consultant.  So anyways, I'm seeing there is so many more guys like you and Alex that are, many of them are really interested in what I'm doing.  Many of them are seeing myself as someone who has like few good steps ahead. Plus, of course, I have a little bit more business experience than a lot of people in this space in general because I'm 14 or 30.  So that's why I have more and more opportunities to refer people like you or Alex. And that's why I thought let's do something together, right?

48:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, I think it makes a lot of sense. I'm just thinking of, I have this thing that whenever something like this pops up, I get really like, I want to be very sure of what I'm doing.  And I'm I'm being very interested because I think you can read me like a book, so it might as well just be very open.  And, and every time that something like this appears, like somebody has an idea of something we can do together, it's not necessarily the business partner or the contract, it's not that, but just like do something together.  I get like, okay, so what is, you know, keeping me cautious about this? And I think I'm exploring this in real time with you, like thinking out loud.  I think it's a certain fear that, like this, this is But like I know what to do and if for me, it would be like a main business and other people would be like a side business, it feels like, I don't know if I interpreted things right.  So the premise is, I think we see similar things, which is very reassuring. And I think there's something here to be done, the uncertainties.  Am I being too tense about this? might. Yeah, I don't know. I want to think about it, because even the reference, like when you show me the references.  In the creative world, having similar references matters a lot, because then the art direction just flows better. But yeah, I like that.

49:59 - Patrick Kizny
  Well, super simple. I'm scheduling another call to follow up with these guys, I need to see how serious they are about throwing money at this thing.  I'm just going to check if they are in a position to throw something like 15-20 grand on this, because with my time, with your time, and with manufacturing of this stuff, this is not going to be a five-grant project, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Update João on client discussions re: deck project next week - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/x18zUQgZ6YY3bJ6yw6FVoNzfEFkGTGm7?timestamp=3016.9999  So I need to make sure that they are serious about it. I don't have to get rich on this one, but having something like that produced is a huge game changer if you want to do this kind of business.

50:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, for sure.

50:46 - Patrick Kizny
  That's why I'm looking more at an opportunity to do something like that. If it turns into a larger business later, that's fine.  If it doesn't, it's a nice story, right? You'll do some cool work, you'll earn a lot with this, you will make a relationship, you'll have a product produced for one client, you'll get paid, it's all good, right?

So I'm talking, I'm going to check if they are serious about it and if they have money, I need to understand how much money they make on this business and what is the scale of their business because I have no  idea at the moment.  I know that these guys are coming from serious companies but it's difficult for me to assess where they are with their business.

51:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They only started this about a year and a half ago. And what's your take on, I'm asking you this very sincerely because I think you have a good eye for this thing.  If they do productizing thing, what's your take on the possibility that they are just going to copy like the way we work?

51:53 - Patrick Kizny
  No, they are doing entirely different things. We were very transparent yesterday on the call. I did walk them. through my entire methodology of work, the entire value method of the back of cards to how I work with what sort of clients, etc.  They walked me through their decks and their methodology. We are doing very different things. There is an overlap, like we are serving creative market, that's one thing in common.  And the second one is that we talk a little bit about value, but I have a value method, they have a value pyramid, which is a one slide in the deck or one module in their entire thinking.  But substantially, we are doing very, very different things. And these guys are not in a position to become deckmakers tomorrow, if that's what you're afraid of.

52:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.

52:48 - Patrick Kizny
  No, no, no, absolutely no risk here, because look, you can steal an idea for a business, but everybody can steal ideas as soon as  you put it out in the web, everybody can steal that, right? But what you cannot steal is the context and the competence and like, you know, what we bring into that.  So if someone is a newbie in business, yes, you should be a little bit afraid that someone will steal your ideas.  But if someone is serious about business at certain threshold, at certain level, people understand that it just doesn't make sense to steal an idea and try to build it from scratch.  If you can collaborate with people who are already behind it and they are good at it.

53:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

53:42 - Patrick Kizny
  Thank you for sharing that. It's just better to buy an operational company rather than trying to build it from scratch.

53:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's why M&A market is so strong. Yeah, let's do it. Let me know if I can help with anything.  Yeah, I've created a game already, actually, for my wife's company. I could bring the thing that it has boxes and stuff.  I didn't do the design of it, because I know you won't like the design. But, yeah, I was thinking about like cases of stuff.  Let me know how I can help you, so to sell this thing. So generally, I mean, I want to do it.  I appreciate your patience with my and not uncertainty, because now I'm certain, but like me is my cautiousness. And, yeah, I mean, let's figure it out, for sure.  We don't need to know the next two years of...

55:00 - Patrick Kizny
  anything so it's fine too. Yeah so I'll let you know probably somewhere around next week and yeah that's that's pretty much it I guess.

55:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice.

55:14 - Patrick Kizny
  Where are you with Alex? What did you speak about and you're having a second meeting or you did have a second meeting with him?

55:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah we had the second meeting. I offered to just you know helping show me like his stuff and see what I can see about it and together we thought about some small improvements maybe you could make.  But Alex is quite smart so I think it was useful in the sense that it's always good to have someone else to do it with you but it would get to those conclusions I think eventually.  So we had a good conversation. This was the second conversation. We had some fun with some labs.

55:57 - Patrick Kizny
  I don't think there's anything around like a leave here.

56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's just like like minded person I have fun talking to. And it also it's it's even like the thing we have also like sharing a certain sense of what we think is happening to the market.  Like so that was also very valuable. So I'm not looking at Alex so much as a potential client. It's just like another peer that's doing something different from a different angle.

56:27 - Patrick Kizny
  Cool.

56:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I thank you for making the connection.

56:31 - Patrick Kizny
  That's good. You get to know him. He's one of the you know few rare people that really appreciate and like I mean I appreciate people that I talked to what I mean.  I'm fascinated by how he thinks and the results he's getting.

56:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah and now it's the same. I have the same feeling about him. he has a very easy going vibe.  So it's like clever but not too formal and that's as good taste the man has good taste which is also a big deal I think so yeah thank you thank you for making the connection.

57:10 - Patrick Kizny
  Oh man, pleasure, lovely. Hey how is everything else with you?

57:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You get all your your your your busy or bored your hesitant where are you with your I'm I'm busy I mean I'm at that stage that I'm busy with more stuff that looks a little bit more like freelancing or contracting and I think it will take a little while until this thing becomes like I'm busy with my thing under my own brand and so on right but yeah I mean putting in the reps I think this week three different people told me that they see like and you told me that they see  something interesting about the whole workshop, productized expertise thing. It was very reassuring because I've been talking about workshops for a little while, but only recently I think I found something that makes it easy for people to connect.  So that was good as well. And yeah, who did you to come again?

58:26 - Patrick Kizny
  Who did you talk to?

58:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this guy, he's was a Brazilian guy I've met. He just sent me a message out of the blue on WhatsApp, telling me, I like the stuff you're doing.  Who else? Because I know it was cheap because at some point it was like, oh, people said that. Alex also said that.  That was someone else I've met. I'm not making this up, but I forgot the exact person's because what I saved was, oh, three people told me this.  Because for me. I think I've told you about this. For me, the phase I am in right now is growing into my confidence.  I don't think I'm naturally very confident or as much as I need to be to run my own creative business.  And yeah, this external validation helps a lot. So I say that in my cooking jar.

59:23 - Patrick Kizny
  The work you're doing, I mean the freelance gigs, this is related to workshops or that's something.

59:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, all of it. All I'm doing is workshops. for one guy, I'm helping a guy is like this older dude that wants to become a consultant.

59:41 - Patrick Kizny
  And I'm helping him shape his first consulting product.

59:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which is almost like coaching. But there's a method that I've created like a little process, a pipeline of things we need to do together.  And so yeah, I think everything I'm doing right now is related in one way.

1:00:00 - Patrick Kizny
  way or another to well thank you for asking this because I didn't realize eventually that's what happened everything I'm doing is related to making expertise tangible either through workshops or like services and an additional perspective that I can bring here is that the way I'm seeing creative industry I mean the studios and agencies and all this kind of  is that everybody who was let's call them let's talk about the visual creative right now so you know studio is doing animation design websites whatever right the industries  right now and will be  for quite a while business as usual is not coming back for many reasons including AI and marketing downturn and the maturity of the market and my big picture perspective on this is that  that it's not only mine because over the last two weeks I talked to 15 consultants in the space from Max trailer circles and Chris Dubois and all these guys, I'm not sure if you know them.  There was the all in agency summit where I went and met a lot of people there. Anyways, I'm seeing a pattern that a lot of people start working with agencies.  They call it differently. They have their different secrets, and and bespoke methods. But all of them have the same direction which is stop selling generic services and go up the value chain by introducing more and more and consulting work to your offering.  And this is an industry wide shift. that is going to happen. It has been happening, but the moment right now is that there is no more way to do to have a healthy business, but without additional layers of strategy consulting and creative services and double execution.  So my main perspective on working with companies like that is built consultative capability in your firm. And whether we do it by helping them share their self leadership and the perspective on the industry, which I call visionary leadership and I financial services and execution services is going to be a big thing in the industry.

1:03:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, creatives need to start selling more thinking and doing in a nutshell. Yeah, yeah, And I mean, I think that phrase you just use is fantastic.  I think there's something there. I mean, you build consultative capacity in your agency. It's as like recently recognizable and it's self-selecting.  If they don't get it, they're not ready to get it. But if they get it, they're like, oh, yes, you finally said the thing I was waiting for, right?  At least, I mean, maybe in those circles you've been, those agency circles you've seen more people talking about this.

1:03:42 - Patrick Kizny
  I haven't been there in those circles in the first time. I've been between people catering towards agency, so agency advisors, right?  And all of them are doing more or less the same stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not exactly. They are addressing  the same problem because the ground level problem is that that agencies are selling their time and are selling the doing and giving strategy for free, the old industry problem.  But yes, they are solving it differently, right? Because Max trailer will help them sell consulting better, freeze the boy will call it an offer, make an offer, stop selling services, I'm talking about the value methodology and visionary leadership.  These guys I talked to yesterday are talking about productize your service and they mean really granular product, this corporate product design approach.  You have guys like this, this social media, the jackpot winner, she doesn't say forgot his name, he got came up a year and a half ago on Twitter, won an agency product.

1:05:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, . Yeah. Yeah, the guy that's made like $1.2 million in a year with his subscription.

1:05:16 - Patrick Kizny
  Subscription design service, exactly. It's quite shallow. He was lucky, right? But anyways, this is happening, right? And these are many solutions to the same problem.

1:05:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because yeah, absolutely, many solutions to the same problem. But what I mean, what you made me think is, when you use the phrase consultative capacity, the place it takes me to is skills and a certain way of doing things, right?  And these, of course, it's like, consultative selling and stuff like that. But also a certain way of presenting and just designers and creatives picking over and checking out, I don't know, McKinsey trains their own consultants to know to be at the board level meeting and just how that dynamic happens.  I'm exaggerating, but you get the caricature. And so I think that's really interesting. There's a thing in design called the design MBA, the D MBA, maybe you've heard of this.  No. It's kind of like teaching designers to stop bitching about people not valuing them and just teaching them how to read like financial statements and how decisions get made.  basics. Business basic for designers. It looks fancy as well made. think it seems to be good product. But I think this intersection of two things, it's really valuable.  So the way you said it, it's on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, consulting capacity, but for me, it really was like, okay, there's something really big on this built consulting capacity.  I will probably use a word capability than capacity, but yeah capacity feels like you're you're right. So that there's that and there was something else I wanted to say.  Oh, yeah, there's a little bit I think this this this move upstream aspect. Also generates something that I think is good for this business.  You're, you know, telling me about the decks, which is you have creative people moving into a more strategic set of services, right?  And these creative people, they are moving into the strategic aspect of services because they want better margins because it's the one only way of keeping their business afloat, right?  But it's likely, or at least very possible, I think, that they don't know what to talk about strategic services.  So they talk about strategic services in the wrong way, right? And then this generates the need for the sort of decks and productized expertise things.  Because, oh, you want to move a market, cool. So now you stay the strategy, cool. But you don't know how to say you do strategy.  You're just now competing with the same other 15 guys that were here. But now you're all together at the same level.  So you need to differentiate not from the market, but from them. And you need to learn how to talk about your method, right?  And then you need the help of this sort of thing you're bringing in at the beginning of the conversation.  So I've been thinking about this for this week. It's a little bit of a conundrum, which is the market needs you to be more strategic.  But the market rewards you for being more concrete. And you want to be strategic, but be able to to talk about strategy in a very concrete way, which is kind of a difficult thing to do.  And I think it made me think of that.

1:09:08 - Patrick Kizny
  Did you, I think you saw the bits and pieces from my conversation with Rob Estrichinio, because we just recorded a podcast.

1:09:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I saw bits of that.

1:09:22 - Patrick Kizny
  Yeah, I did about it. And we were talking for about an hour exactly about these things. Because he, he's a strategist and he's coming from the agency background.  So strategy means something different there. But we're talking about it. Like, what does it mean to be a strategist?  How do you sell strategy these days? How do you balance between being a hardcore strategist and being a doer?  And we rephrase strategy as an informed way of doing or he said an informed way of winning, I guess.

1:10:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've been following for a couple of years since Twitter days. I like the way it talks about stuff.  It's also Portuguese, you know, small country syndrome. Every time you see a country, you need to mention it. We have that in Portugal.  Okay, so, well, fascinating as usual. Let's do something together. Let me know if there's something I can do to give you more ammo for your conversations.  I guess that's it.

1:10:42 - Patrick Kizny
  There may be an opportunity for you also to design workshops for them or like help them with workshops. So, when the time is right, I'll chat with, I'll connect you to.  I mean, maybe we'll be doing this deck and following the deck, you will get into the workshops, right? I already mentioned you.  maybe some business down the line with these guys and also following this conversation think about your thoughts and angle because we could do a podcast together about these things that we just discussed today.

And maybe I think I think some of this stuff you would resonate with some other stuff. No, but these emails usually you don't get sent out.  I just post it and I'll take a look.

1:13:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, let me know. I want to keep talking to you learning more from you and hopefully be helpful as well.  My only thing was not to stretch myself too thin, but yeah, you got that from me as well, so it's fine.
