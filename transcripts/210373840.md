0:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We spoke briefly today, and I also saw the slide messages, so it gave me a little bit of context on that, and yeah, basically I would say yes, and we have some ideas for, I think joining some ideas for for today.

0:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, great.

0:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Let's see. Okay.

0:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Let's see what, okay, everybody get Romeo's here. Okay, so we're just waiting for Mao. Are we going to send him a link, is it?  I sent him a link, he's replied, so I think he's trying to. Okay.

1:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But, well, in any way, you can do a little bit of just again. So from my understanding, I've been working on some screens, some designs, right, especially for forms.  And there was something about the new requests, right, that there's four new requests. I understand. Yeah. Okay. But the other things, they stand the same timeline, was were there any other things that were moved around?  No, I think it's also just like discussing the the way that we collaborate and get a little bit nervous, that we there's always like three people trying to coordinate three times.

2:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  to do different things where it's like a typical UX UI relationship you'd have you know one person and we just like sit next to Romeo like can you change this can you change this you know can you change this and I think that it's getting to a point that we need to be able to move move faster and just like kind of go go there and I'm not sure if this format is working like it was working more like with eggs when we were kind of strategizing building it and now we have to like be able to execute on some of these and really fast changes in order to be able to launch them with our client and I think that that flexibility we're kind of losing between the three different people and three different time zones and I mean like yeah different time zones and everything so but we can see how it works out this week in terms of like what can be produced in this kind of manner but it is thing that I'm a little bit yeah concerned with and I want to flag now so that we can yeah see how best we can find a solution for that yeah because it's also hard with like not having regular communication to like and we're now that we talked about having daily sync so then we can  see but then it's like if we don't have the quick iteration and it's like we don't get the right feedback and it just goes on a little bit longer and so we need to figure out something about that too.

3:12 - Mau
  Got it.

3:16 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'll give you the, after this I can give you a quick context on this first five minutes but yeah basically just to ask about the four new things and if timelines have changed or stuff like that.  So do you have an agenda for today or we can use what we Well I don't know.

3:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think Mao was supposed to meet with Romeo last week and kind of come up with that plan because I feel like we have so many planning that we keep re-planning sometimes we just need to be kind of okay let's develop you know some things and do that so but it would be good to understand like your plan and your timing Mao after our conversation on some of these.

4:02 - Mau
  Oh, we cannot hear you, no.

4:04 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay.

4:31 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  For some reason it seems like he's making a sound but you cannot hear anything. It's weird. Yeah, I've never seen that one.

4:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Let's make a sound, Maurice.

4:53 - Mau
  No, I see it.

5:12 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I try to really try to kill the app and turn the app on again, maybe that can help, usually turning on and off helps.  Yeah, that's a classical. Yeah, the thing. Standard fix approach.

5:28 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

5:32 - Mau
  Can you hear me now?

5:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yes.

5:35 - Mau
  Sorry. I think what we discussed on Friday, we are still on the timeline that the other four tests we need to finish them by Friday.  Right. So nothing has changed actually for the four requests, the new request. Okay, so I have designs like started yet on that that we can like kind of go through and see if we're on the right track, or is it now we haven't started yet because it wasn't Friday so we had some other things to do so this morning.  So we are going to work after this, and then she just to check if you have anything else, apart from what we discussed so I think it's okay for now, so I don't know necessarily if we can go to that.

6:41 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Maybe if you have something else that you thought about after we talk or discuss on Friday, but so far so good.

6:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, and it could be good for you because I'm traveling today so tomorrow I won't be able to meet but maybe have a call with even on it to see the program.  tomorrow I think would be good. One thing Mao is just telling Xiao before you joined is that I'm a little bit concerned in terms of like when you usually have a UX UI designer we have one person that we can just talk to go back and forth on some of these changes but in the way that we've been working it's been kind of coordinating three different schedules and the different times when Xiao was in Portugal and they're doing a lot of planning and I think we're at the point where through our discussion with like with Emon last week where we need to be able to go like have really quick changes on some of these different things and then like how like is there a way to work better in that maybe these daily things will help but it's just something I'm looking at like would it be easy we just have one person like next to us that we could just be like okay change this right now you know and do this for the development rather than be like okay we need to change this we need to send out an email we need to plan and then we need to come back and then I feel like that might be slowing things down a little bit from from where we are I think when we were with the eggs thing it made sense we're doing more strategy okay what are we building I think we're kind of now that realizing now that we're at the execution phase and I've just noticed like because I've been going to

8:00 - Mau
  Actually, the prototype with my father who's a computer engineer and I realized there's so many small parts that don't only make sense.

8:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you know, we don't explain things enough like on risk assessment or what it actually means because he's totally new to the subject.  He was like, I don't understand what this means.

8:14 - Mau
  I don't, you know, those need like really quick responses so we could be like, okay, let me sit next to a UX designer, fix this.  So then the design team can, you know, can implement it. And I, and I worry that the way that we're set up, we're not agile enough to do that in this like execution phase, which is like kind of the planning phase.

8:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But we can see how this works, it's like, better also understanding what your availability to, and then it doesn't make more sense to have somebody who's like kind of dedicated to us a certain amount of hours a week that we could just like kind of pull from.  But that's just something, yeah, I'm trying to figure out but we can see how this week goes and everything.  But this is more, you guys can also think too, like kind of your availability on that if we need like immediate changes and that and how to go through, you know, not having  Go through three different people just being going straight to the designer and be like, okay, we need these changes.  Or if that works, would that make sense? Like, I think it's okay for me.

9:12 - Mau
  We have to test that I'm going to check our ability to for the two weeks if we can be dedicated for that.  So, and then we can decide upon the show that lines for the logic. So, yeah, I'm going to check to always coming back today.  So we have some kind of stats, but I think we need to The daily meetings are quite interesting to make, but we need to have a guideline for every day about what we are developing.  also, I think we need to understand the flux of information. know, if you think about something which is not working properly on, you know, the journey, so we are going to  give us input and maybe on PigmaPy or somewhere else so we can organize everything because otherwise we can make or can be a little bit lost in everything so because there are so many permissions coming from you know different sizes different sites and also some kind of you know different channels also so I believe me as well we were trying to figure out how to make this easier faster developing this kind of flow but flow of information so yeah we were talking about like JIRA maybe using JIRA last week you know and doing that and I think the flow of information because it goes through three different people and like on kind of three different things and makes it more difficult and like kind of going straight one and having a general note of following up on that but I agree with you I think it's like it's that that part now it's also you know really hoping from you guys like you know coming in with like and I think it's also the availability right

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you guys have a lot of other projects it's like coming in it was like it was quite noticeable when my dad who's like 70 you know even though he's a computer engineer he doesn't know anything about the subject you know and he's like going in clicking on the app and just being like what is a risk assessment you go straight into this and then like I don't you know and then he was like one to five is one high or five low right and these are the things I was hoping that you guys you know when I asked you guys like please go through this and like go in with a new beginner's eyes on this like you know we would catch some of these things as part of your work and then redesign it and rework it and and maybe that's not a part of the the role but now I'm realizing that there's actually a lot like as I went through with my dad I'm like okay the text is actually copied wrong it doesn't make sense and that and this needs really quick reiteration of like okay then what is new design so then Yvonne and his team can fix it or I need to go straight to Yvonne and Yvonne we have that discussion like maybe I just sit down with one of your engineers and we go in and do it there I'm not sure but like we're at the execution

12:00 - Mau
  Right where we want to launch in like two or three weeks.

12:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And this is the kind of like the important time and doesn't make sense to find Somebody who could just like, you know, sit with us, you know, and make these changes immediately, you know, and Next door or something like that.  I'm not I'm not sure, but it's just something that Yeah, it's something a little bit Concerning that we need to Yeah, I figure out about that that flexibility aspect of it, but we can yeah, see how the designs go this weekend how it is, but it just Yeah, I worry a little bit.

12:34 - Mau
  just about like kind of the availability and then the coordination Yeah, we are we are going to check on from our side.  We are committed, you know, to To accomplish this deadline, but what you are saying right now for me is something that Maybe we need to classify all those changes, you know, in terms of this is completely as you just mentioned  This is completely making no sense, or this is something that people can, some people will understand, so we have to test it, and then this is something that we are not going to change right now.  So that would be classifying the urgency of that, but not that urgent, and then, you know, maybe because we are going to have lots of bits and pieces about them and some changes.  So, and then this will impact the design or development. So I think we need to create this kind of system to just to put all the changes in different boxes and, you know, in a planning, because otherwise we can just like interrupt some processes, rather than just fix what needs to be fixed.  That's true. Just my reflection.

13:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think we need to kind of gather all the changes that need to be made, and then we need to prioritize them, like you said, like is this an immediate, is this a nice to have for that.  But then there's also like some, know, and I agree with this, but this is like kind of the, it's like, okay, if we're doing policies, procedures and trainings, you know, okay, then like, let's sit together really closely on every, you know, going to go through each one on a fine-tuned comb, like, does this work, does this work, you know, does this work, and how do we iterate the designs very quickly on some of these.  And I think it's like, I think it's, I just felt like in the last month, it's been, it's been really great the designs that we see, but oftentimes it's like, okay, when I ask you something, I'm like, okay, well, need to check my job on Romeo and we need to do plan planning.  then, and then, and then we have another task that we need to do is like, okay, I need to go to Romeo and then we need to do some planning where it's like, like, for me, it's like, sometimes like, we need, like, you know, just immediate, like, to have someone next to us, okay, can you, you know, execute on this immediately, like, in the day and then, like, do that, you know, if you had like a UX designer, like, if we had PNR, like, you know, just like, kind of allocated to us and then, like, you know, if she can do that, I think that's kind of the, what I realized, think is like, and then think maybe in the planning.  As is what we're just kind of handing over from eggs. It's fine. But now we're at the execution phase where we need to make these changes and be able to test out the software and to work that this model might not be the best solution for that.  So that's what I'm trying to figure out. Yeah, we are going to check.

15:15 - Mau
  We were talking about this this morning. we don't have this. We have a sort of a plan, but, you know, we're going to connect to more structure plan.  Yeah. And it's like, even like, yeah, with that, with the planning, it's like at one point it's like.

15:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We plan, but we just need to execute.

15:31 - Mau
  And if we had like, oh, 1 person doesn't pay the cost. We wouldn't need to always plan.

15:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  could just be like, okay, like, execute. So I think, but I think you understand where I'm coming from.

15:38 - Mau
  So I think it's more, let's see how this can, how this can work.

15:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because I think it's more like, we really need to execute, at least the policies procedures and that part. And I do think that, I have now looking in more detail, like, and through the highs of my father, I'm like, oh my gosh, like, you know, even like the risk management, we copied the wrong taxes.  Still referring to third party because we, we've used some of the same text from before. Like, and these are the things I'm hoping like, you know, if you guys were like our dedicator can set certain hours, you know, to our project, then you'd be like, okay, I'm going to sit down and like, try to find some of these two with the design.  I how would this look like that would help to, but I don't know if that's possible.

16:15 - Mau
  I don't know what the hours and so that's like kind of I'm trying to figure out how best to manage this that I see, you know, coming up.  Yeah, we have some ideas that we talked this morning, but one of the things that, you know, when you were considering would be more like visual planning, like, as we did, for example, on the Mario board, you know, rather than just like having another type of tool like gyro right now.  So, you know, we need to adapt the best, but maybe just like, we could also work on stigma and making comments as I did before so that would be a way of working.

16:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, I'm.

17:00 - Mau
  at the moment, so I'm not sure that, you know, with Jira, we should gain any kind of speech, so, yeah.

17:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, I'm just going to try to paraphrase to see if I got the main points. So, what I got from Abby is that the current system of each change needs to be coordinated and we need to figure out and to keep the plan.  This is, you know, introducing too much complexity into quick changes. This is what I get from you, Abby, please correct me if I didn't get it right.  And one of the ways that we could make this disaster would be something around allocation or maybe daily conversations about this.

17:55 - Mau
  And just a quicker pace between finding something that's wrong and correct. that thing.

18:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Did I understand it correctly? Yeah, I think that's it.

18:05 - Mau
  Yeah, exactly that.

18:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so and what I've heard from Mauricio is that so from last, from the last conversation you guys had on last Friday and today, so during the weekend nothing changed but now it's the week that we will, you know, be developing these tasks that were asked and related to that, I think what you, Abby, were asking is like a little bit more of quality control like just make sure you're copying the right things and you, you know, crossing the T's and dotting the I's and just like the opportunity of seeing things shaping up as they shape up instead of just a chunk at the end.  this correct?

18:54 - Mau
  Yeah, I don't think the quality control is like more on your side because it's more like the developers we had put it.

19:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  just to put in some placeholder text, right? But I think as you guys are going through it, a big thing is you guys have a new eye coming in.  does this actually make sense? Do we need to add more detail? And I feel like it's been a little bit more about optimizing what's already there rather than some things.  I'm not sure. I'm just not sure about this going through.

19:23 - Mau
  Even our core changes that we discussed on Friday, and you can look at it, I believe two of them can be done actually really quickly.

19:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Two of them will take a little bit longer. So why are we waiting until Friday to get those two?  Can we just iterate and just have that done by today or tomorrow, those two, and then move those three?  That feedback loop, some of them, I feel, I can't go faster if we had someone right next to us and be like, OK, you're just spending today getting this done rather than you're spending because of the hours.  You're spending one hour here, one hour here, one hour here. Friday, you've been done. That's five hours versus just spending five hours in one day and then getting it back.  Do you know what I mean? Because I. You guys have other projects you have other things that you're working on and then that the coordinate between the three different schedules like we would just want somebody that can like, you know, that has a little bit more availability.

20:09 - Mau
  got, okay, do this.

20:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  have and now even can get the first one done, you know, by that Monday, even can start, you know, programming that one Tuesday while we work on that.  And I feel like it's sometimes like, okay, we need to plan.

20:20 - Mau
  Okay. This is okay. We're going to have it by Friday.

20:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. You know, here and then by that time, like we lose a little bit of agility there based on like that, the planning across three people and then checking that.  Yeah.

20:32 - Mau
  Okay.

20:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But even do you have any thoughts too, because I know you need to leave. Yeah, I agree.

20:41 - Mau
  I agree with you. And yeah, let's let's see how it goes.

20:46 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think that for some, so it's too much of working, I would say one is planned. We always have to plan we always have to have a clear list of priorities and there I agree with everyone.

20:55 - Mau
  But sometimes we need to be able to do quick changes.

20:58 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  For example, please can you up. this screen to have, I don't know,-down menu instead of input.

21:03 - Mau
  I'm now paraphrasing, you know, but just to understand what I'm saying. I would say we need to be able to, sorry, let me mute, we need to be able to move quickly and some stuff, another stuff, of course not.  Some other stuff needs to be done carefully with planning and with everything.

21:17 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I would say those are two different modes of work that we need to be able to support.

21:20 - Mau
  We are a very small team, so I would say we need to move quickly when needed. That's it, to reach deadlines.

21:27 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  That's the only goal, basically, is to reach the deadline. yeah, that's my comment.

21:31 - Mau
  Also, just to end before, Mao, I will reply in a thread-in-slag, type you, we forgot to add one more thing to the list, and it can be, it's training questions, but that can be added to the end.

21:42 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  It's, I mean, it doesn't have to be part of those. We can just add it as the last item in the list and do it then, just so it works.

21:48 - Mau
  I saw that we don't have it, so yeah, just so you have that in mind. That's it from my side.

21:58 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Thank

22:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, but then I don't know like even and mouth I'm traveling tomorrow, but maybe or with Romeo.

22:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Can I have a call in the afternoon?

22:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know who wants to send it because I'll be traveling just to show the designs in between then and see if you can give any feedback quickly.  And then I think I set up calls or once a Thursday Friday to go over already. So we have those.

22:26 - Mau
  Yeah, we have them.

22:27 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

22:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so who's setting it isn't you even or now what time do you have time or Romeo or do you guys want to come back with the time and then Yeah, I'm going to come back over the top because we are going to meet all the three of us now up in this sink and then we come back straight forward to Yeah, that sounds good.

22:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  That sounds good. Okay.

22:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But then great.

22:51 - Mau
  Any other comment or questions? No, no, no. Okay.

22:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right, great. Thank you so much.

23:01 - Mau
  All right. Thank you. Thank you.

23:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right.

23:03 - Mau
  Bye. Bye.
