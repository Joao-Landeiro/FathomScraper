  Good, good, I love the fact that every time we speak, I mean, it's been two times, so it's 100% of the times.  You have a different background color.

0:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, sometimes we have to change the color to change my psychology. I mean, I'm not being sarcastic.

0:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I think it's cool. I think my lighting is always very yellow, so that's cool.

0:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So you change according to how your pure change is kind of on a... It's a way just to change things around.  It shifts something in me, know, like maybe I get into a color and into a perspective. So when I switch it out, I switch my mind.

0:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's true. For me, that's really strong with music. So I think... Yeah.

1:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think that happens with everyone, right?

1:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But there's some tasks that I just put like, I don't know, coffee, table, I like just do the thing.  And then sometimes I put, I don't know, daft punk when I'm doing like graphical work and I'm in a bit of a rush.  Yeah. And it works. So how was your weekend? was this week? Amazing, amazing.

1:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  did I do this week and just chill and rest a lot because I've been having lots of work in, and I needed to take a rest.  But yes, I think rest is also like productive, you know?

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know about you, but sometimes I feel little bit guilty with resting. But I know this is silly, but it just happens that I'm like, oh, maybe I should be doing something, maybe should be productive.  Anyway.

1:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It happens at the beginning, but eventually, you know, like I know that when I rest, I deliver better.

2:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's a little bit of like, it's a journey like I said in the beginning, I suppose, I will get there eventually.  I'm not there yet. still feel guilty, but it was worse in the past. So maybe we'll get there. So, yeah, so this is great that you had a good weekend and you're rested and you can bring the lights up again if you want.  I'm not judging. And last week we had this conversation and you told me a little bit more about not a little, you told me quite a bit more about what's happening in your world, in your business, and you are your business, so all these things intersect.  And I've put together what I think makes sense for first to do together and I'll walk through it and I'd like to see if it makes sense to you.  But first of all, just to check that From the last conversation we had from last week, there's like four things you've mentioned that I framed as needs or things that you're trying to solve right now.  The first one is related to this transitioning from the healing aspect to the brand building or the identity building aspect, different business, right?  You also mentioned and we touch on this right now, the desire of make a living but don't let it take over your life, right?  Just have enough work that makes sense but doesn't, you know, overwhelm you. One of the things you've mentioned that was difficult was hiring people or managing that aspect.  And finally, there was this idea of, you touch on these in different ways, but basically creating great experiences that don't need to happen only in the physical world.  is this still accurate? Am I on point here? Yes. Okay. So okay, that's great. So basically, let me tell you how I think we can solve this or we can address this.  You've used the word that I really liked. I wrote it down and gave you credit for it, which is, you called it the nuclear framework, which I thought this is a really good name because of the both senses of nuclear, right?  But I think the best way of approaching this is more nuclear in the sense of several little things than one massive thing, okay?  So instead of the major framework that underlines everything that you do, I believe it will be easier and more flexible, adaptable to have a set of different frameworks that are a little bit smaller.

5:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  and they make sense together but there's not like this this magna magma of us of your way of thinking how do you feel about this yes and if I can let me show you like kind of a visual representation of that maybe this couldn't work do you see my yeah now I did is loading up yeah you see this like phase one phase two phase three and each different phase has different kind of mini frameworks depending on the results we want to get right so I don't have anything decided yet but this is like when I say like the frameworks in each face I don't know if it's different name or maybe it's just the protocols on this face but the the framework is it the big one phase one phase two phase three or is the framework the little ones you know but at the end I think it this is the  methodology in the frameworks inside the methodology and inside the frameworks we have protocols and we have tools, right? that's what I want to like kind of create in a way.

6:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Now, okay, okay, this is good, this is good. Thank you for showing it because I think it makes it, you know, a little bit more tangible for me.  I would like, I'd just like to make a little distinction because maybe we're talking about the same thing or not.  When I think about frameworks, I'm thinking more about building blocks of thinking, right? And less about tools. So if you have these building blocks of how you think, then you can figure out, oh, this tool makes sense for this way of thinking or this exercise connects with this thing, but we could separate them, right?  You could have like frameworks that are purely conceptual. Let's say, oh, there's the triangle of good a psychedelic experience.  It's not a good example, because it told me it's four steps. But anyway, the square or the diamond of psychedelic experiences.  And this is not an exercise or an activity, but it's an image that people are like, oh, yeah, I know Jorge, he is the guy from the diamond of a good psychedelic clinical experience, right?  This is what I mean when I talk about frameworks. Does this connect still with what you were expecting? Yes.

7:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I understand like a framework could be like a way of seeing through some lengths. Yeah. could be like a mental model or a graphic representation, but also like kind of an exercise, or that should be like a methodology, that kind of.

7:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would separate them, because if we separate them each time that we use one word, we know exactly what we're talking about.  But I think it's very. And this is kind of a peer conversation, like when you talk to your clients that do not know about your thing, I think it's okay if you mention, oh, this is my framework for doing this thing.  And it actually looks like canvas or something. I think that's fine for customers. Because we will be doing this work of mapping out you think and all these things connect for our sessions for our conversations.  I think it will be useful to say, oh, this is about a framework. And this is about a canvas for instance, and then we just separate them.  But overall, for the market, I don't think people make a distinction.

8:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, the market won't know the difference. It's like I was looking at a chef TV show and, you know, just the connoisseurs or people that know will differentiate the texture of the pasta.  It's the same, you know, so for us, I think it's good to have a distinction, but at the end, you know,  like we have this framework, what if we use, for example, like the Business Model Canvas, is that a framework, it's in a model or an exercise to get some results.  And in a way, it's a framework and in a way, it's an exercise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if it was with you that we were talking about the history behind the Business Model Canvas, that it was a PhD thesis.

9:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I can't remember.

9:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No? Because I was very curious about that, and I went to research it. Like, where does it come from, right?  And it comes from like a PhD thesis that it was just like a framework of understanding how things connect.  It was not a practical thing. And eventually, they wanted that way of thinking to become famous, and then they created the tool around the framework.  So if you have the framework, you can put tools on it, but it's relatively easy.

9:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So if your framework could be just the lens. And the practical tool is how you can translate it to others to just get the results with the framework.  Oh, the framework we understand yet, to have a good experience, you have to have the new, I don't know, a good dosage, a good sitter, and a good mindset setting, right?  But how does that translate, okay, let's do an exercise. Let's use the framework of setting setting, and now, like, to have it in a practical tool, let's ask some questions, like, how are you preparing for the experience, like, what kind of documentaries or what kind of psych education are you looking at, you know, so that's how you do the better than practical tool, right?  Well, end, it's just like kind of a map of how we're doing things, right? This noisy work, we have this framework, know, we want to focus on this, and then we're going to get deep into it, okay.  Yeah, it's a little bit like a fractal, right?

11:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. depending on the zoom level, you see different things, but they all connect with each other. And yeah, so good.  I wanted to check because otherwise I could be spending the whole time talking about something that means a different thing to you.  Cool. So we will create this group, this set of smaller frameworks in the sense of smaller concepts, a small mental models, right?  The good thing about that is that you could create several different exercises, different canvases for the same framework, because you could look at it from different perspectives, right?  It's the thing that you've mentioned. So you have these four factors, and you can explore one of the factors from the perspective of why, and then a certain exercise makes sense.  You could explore the same factor from the perspective of who. do this and then you have a different set of questions and exercises and I think you got the picture so anyway you have this the common ground and you lay things on top of it and the way the way I want to codify this is simple is for sessions 90 minutes each session we do it on Miro and Google Google bits like we are doing right now and there's two perspectives two sides of this that I believe are very important to capture one side is your perspective which is more about like your worldview and the other side is more about your process right and inside of each of these things we have different like I said smaller frameworks  The aspect of starting with your perspective, I think you're the kind of guy that this makes sense to, is mostly because there's a way you look at the world that gives you the confidence that this business makes sense and, you know, you have something valuable that could help people.  And there's a whole lot of things that inform your model of reality and to you that makes sense, right?  And they already exist, there's already an internal coherence inside your mind that makes like an idea, look like Jorge Elizondo idea, like they have the same DNA because they are inside your head, they are coherent by definition.  So the first set of frameworks is about how you look at the world, and this is divided into other subtopics, but basically that's it.  And the other set is a little bit more square. Let's say, which is about the process, which is about what you do, how you do it, why you do it, why you do it, the way you do it, this kind of more process oriented business model, not business model, business process notation, shards and stuff like that.  Does it make sense to you? Yes. Okay. This is good to hear. And basically this, this back, it costs $860 and we can break it down in three parts.  Okay. And the value to you is, of all the things you've told me, the connecting thread that I saw between like the hiring people, the getting more rich, because you've mentioned this, right?  You want more reaches. Obviously, money is an objective as well, but having the reach for your ideas is like the biggest thing, so growing the company and expanding the reach.  And also one of the things you've mentioned that I found a little bit curious to be honest, you've mentioned that you have people that help you with your content, right?  They create content for you. Yes. I know I saw that you you've made some videos, really beautiful videos by the way.  like that style. Is this what you're talking about? Or you also mean like the writing stuff?

15:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What's the question about the content?

15:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because what I found is creating the content also helps solidify what we think about things. So the more content you personally create, the stronger the connections become because you're exploring your own thinking as you create your content.

15:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know if it's the same point, You know, like, I think I'm a more a writer than a hard and a visual artist.  That's why I have, like, this marketing company that they do the designs, because if I could do the designs, I will do it myself, because I have lots of ideas, you know, but I think I cannot translate that into visual design.  So I know how to write, and I know how to write my ideas. But the thing that I need, it's how I can, you know, like, right now I'm developing, like, the four phases of the people that it's hard, that they're having to have a hard time integrating.  And it's lots of information, and they don't know where to start. two, they're like, integrating the information, but they don't have a guidance, so they have fear to not do, to not take the right decision.  And we have different phases, I have lots of content of, kind of, information that it's. useful or maybe I leave them in the size so they can mature and let's see if it works and I have lots of ideas but I haven't been able to put it in a visual framework but that's what I want to do now because okay you know I'm doing a video but in a video it comes with a presentation when they see a graph you know like maybe you are here after your psychedelic experience you know and what happens you come down and you don't integrate your learnings so why is that you know what happens so if I accompany my speech or minority with these visual frameworks they will they're gonna see they know like he knows what he's talking about and as well like he already knows like what's happening he knows the whole thing you know he's talking like he's not guessing you know like what's the next step he already knows where I'm at you know in a way so I know where you are if I can identify the place that you are in  you want to resolve, you don't want to take psychedelics for killing, you want to resolve, you know, but that's why a lot of people lose clarity because they forget what their initial intention.  So in a way, I think I have good ideas, my brain is a writer and he likes to write down lots of stuff, sometimes I write like maybe 20 pages a day, but that's not enough people don't read, you a lot of my taste people don't read them, so I need to put them in visuals, I have to create content, but also creating content, me talking, it's a lot of time, but if I actually have the frameworks, I just expand the frameworks and I would play with the frameworks and send them through short emails or maybe in a pause or in a story or do you want to know more about this framework, I can't do just a webinar about a framework, you know, like that's what I want to do because in a way I don't need more people in my team, what I need is just having these frameworks.  and done so I can scale my business more in a way. know, my reach had to use it.

19:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

19:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I made perfect sense.

19:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I apologize because I think I was using it. I interpreted what you said about creating content. I think I interpreted it in a very narrow way.  Because I assume that you were outsourcing everything. But now I see what I see your point. Like you're outsourcing like the visual aspect of it.  But like the coming up with the connections, you are writing that.

19:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's fine.

19:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the most valuable thing, right? We know what we think by writing. So that was my point. And I see that you're doing that.  Perfect. And so, you've touched on this right now. Like this sense that you have a lot of content, lot of ideas, lot of things inside of you.  And because you are out again. I will risk this. I think you are a complex person, right? And because of that, you have this immense capacity for making connections and creating a personal perspective, that then gets a little bit locked inside of your own mind, right?  And the frameworks would help with that. Am I correcting this assumption?

20:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, the frameworks also simplify my thinking, instead of having this big mind, I'm going to automate some way of thinking in this framework, so I can condense this, and I can put my mind to do other things.

20:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love that you said that, because one of the advantages I wrote down here, and you'll get this in the proposal, was that frameworks or a set of your own frameworks will create a little bit of guardrails around the  your creativity, right? You can still obviously explore because you are that kind of person, but they allow you to not have to rediscover the wheel every time because you already have done this work, you have captured this, you have your frameworks, and now there's little, there's some parts of your business that are a little bit boring, but that they require your focus.  now that you have the frameworks like, okay, this part is done, I'll just write invoices or call my account and that kind of stuff because you have the clarity that, oh, my thinking is captured in the frameworks, okay.  You've probably noticed that I didn't talk about workshops here, yeah, because I don't think that this is a workshop moment for now, to be honest, and I think it would not be very fair of me to try to sell you like, oh, get your method and the workshop for the method.  because that would be a much bigger commitment from you. Yeah, I don't think it would make sense to sell you a workshop format now.  I think if we do the frameworks, you can do it later with a workshop. You can even do it with someone else.  That's fine. But I would first really nail down the frameworks and then focus on the workshop.

22:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, I like that first for the frameworks and then we'll see about the workshop, but let's do it step by step.

22:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And honestly, to be very transparent, I mean, I know you already handle Miro and that kind of thing. Building a workshop is more than Miro, of course, but the point is with the frameworks, there's some aspects of this that you'll probably be able to do on your own.  You know, so you can make the decision when the time comes to it.

22:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's no point in locking yourself in that right now.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, just to recap, you're moving from those four needs, moving from healing to identity, personal brand and expansion, making a living without, know, getting overwhelmed, growing, hiring more people, and, you know, taking advantage of the digital aspect.  The way I propose we do this is that instead of making a big framework is to make a set of smaller frameworks that belong to two different worlds, your perspective and your process, you know.  The way I believe we can do this best is four sessions, they need to be longer than one hour, they need to be 90 minutes.  More than that, we start to get a bit tired and fuzzy and that there's no point. So, I wouldn't do like, oh, let's do questions.  We have two sessions for perspective. And the same structure. first session is more about emptying your mind and just putting things on the paper.  And then the second session is crafting the framework. Oh, like for this thing you said, I think the best image to talk about this is a stare.  Okay, I think a stare is a strong mental analogy that makes sense here. Okay, for this other thing you're talking about probably the best way of describing this way of thinking that you that you talk about is a van diagram with two circles intersecting, because this is less about the process is about more about the ontology of things.  So first we get information on the second session. We shape that information into frameworks. And so far so good.  Okay, so So I don't think there's a lot of people that do the thing you do, but there's a few, right?  Especially in your world, you start to see them and bump into them. So the frameworks will help you, like, stand out and have a more proprietary aspect.  You know this, that's why you would be called. Another thing that the frameworks will help do is give people something that they can describe or work with, right?  Oh, there's Jorge with four diamond, four points, diamond, of good clinical psychedelic experiences, course. They also create the guardrails that we discussed around the creativity, so you don't need to follow this shiny thing all the time.  It will still happen. We are creative people, or there's no point in denying that, but can give a little bit more structure.  And finally, increasing that reach of the ideas, because it's easier for people to talk about your work and to interact with your  ideas, right? A visual framework is a little bit like putting handles on a thought. People can think, they can pick up that thought, look at it from different sides and put it down, right?  And that's it. Sounds good?

26:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Sounds good?

26:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you have any questions? you like to move forward? Is there... I like to move forward.
  ACTION ITEM: Send detailed proposal email to Jorge with framework development plan and payment details - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/YSu4yAs48hA7NWTum9u4sVya5ynKYeqj?timestamp=1588.9999

26:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool.

26:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  love...

  I love...

26:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm loving these conversations, you're very decisive.

26:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, that's why I'm here.

26:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, true. Okay, so I'll send you this. Which is my proposal to explain everything in detail. The first step is we schedule the first session.  You want to schedule it now? Yes.

26:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

26:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you will tell me the payment link, right?

27:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I mean, I have time this week.

27:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me see, what's, let me pull the, are you in Mexico right now? Yes, I have 4 pm, 3.58 or 4 pm.  Let me just add your, what city, which city are you in right now? Maybe that you get that.

27:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm also, I'm also working right now in my branding, but I'm, have this tagline, you know, like it's, we're still arriving because more than just psychedelic experience, we're still arriving unlocks innovation, you know, and I'm, I'm trying to mix a set of things in it's kind of a visual technology like Miro.  I like experiences and mindset training. in a way, people are doing just the psychedelic experience, but they're happy. having a hard time integrating because they don't have the tools, know, at the end, people need practical tools, the guidance, the map, the route, and psychological safety.  I'm just, I'm just excited to create my frameworks. Okay, it's really exciting work.

28:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you are three hours, three hours, hours behind me. What would be a good time for you this week?  For me, tomorrow is a pretty open day, Thursday as well. have space in the other days as well, Tuesday and Thursday are probably the ones that is going to be easier to fit your agenda.

28:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We can do Thursday.

28:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

29:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  we can do my like at this time like 4 p.m. that is going to be a for 7 p.m.  you 4 p.m.

29:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  7 p.m. Yes, correct. And one at 90 minutes, right?

29:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  90 minutes, yes.

29:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that okay with you? So I'll put session on. Tell me if you got the email, please.

29:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh, well.

29:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did I get it right? Sorry. Did you get the email?

30:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Cool.

30:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did I kick you out of the call?

30:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  was looking at my demo and I put refresh what I had you on. Okay.

30:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem. I refresh you. And by the way, we don't need to schedule it right now for all the other sessions, but just to be on the safe side.  Would that time be okay for future sessions, like once a week?

30:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Once a week would be nice. Or maybe we can do, it depends in your time where we can do two next week or just one or one, you know, or two.  depends on you.

30:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would prefer once a week. Okay. I think we also have a little bit more time to call this and think about what's happening.  But my point is the same time, like next Thursday, would that same time make sense for the following Thursdays for you?  Let's see the following Thursdays.

31:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have free Thursday, next Thursday, next Thursday, yes. If we can escalate in advance, I'm open. I think it's best.

31:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay. Session two, okay, okay, okay, okay, session three, okay, okay, and session four, okay. Okay. I will later add more detail to them, but I just don't want to take too much time from you now.
  ACTION ITEM: Review proposal email from João, prepare for first framework development session - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/YSu4yAs48hA7NWTum9u4sVya5ynKYeqj?timestamp=1941.9999  Yeah, okay, so I've sent you all of them. Perfect.

32:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I went on the email that I'm ready to start. Cool, very cool.

32:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You don't need to do any pre-work, just to be, you know, open-minded to it. If you want to send me something for me to read before, I'll gladly take it.  I think anything you can do ahead of time that gives me more context, more ways of how you think I think it's going to be useful.

32:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And that's it.

32:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you an email right after this call with a proposal and the details, that kind of stuff.

33:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfect. Perfect.

33:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Thank you.

33:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Great talk with you as usual.

33:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That was an amazing challenge.

33:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ciao.

33:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  See you next Thursday. Yes. Bye-bye.

33:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Bye.
