0:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  that pop up that comes in the middle of your screen and says some nice picture or animation with text and you can click next next next and it explains how it works but that will come afterwards and I think the major part of work there will be on the design team and Abby and Brighton to define how the content for that will look like but we can postpone the discussion for later.

0:20 - A L
  I think that third party is a lot more complex than the dashboard so the dashboard is more visualization understand the key points where the party management has a lot more like approvers blah blah upload blah blah like so that's why I think it takes a little bit more time for third party management so that we can kind of focus on that now but Ajau and I we have had like a session with it so it's more about visualized I think Romeo just needs to maybe draw it up but I'm not sure where he is on also even I can't make 330 today because I have a parent teacher meeting so but you guys can meet with Romeo  and follow up and find out where they are and update as part. No problem, no.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, but OK, just to be sure, we have discussed third party, and I believe that at the time, our understanding, I still think it's a good idea, but I don't remember if you guys still like that idea, was that third party and controls conceptually, they are similar, and we can reuse a lot of things from controls for third party.

1:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think we were thinking about controls. I think we mentioned the controls part being reused because third party had some controls on its own, if I'm not mistaken, that are both controls and part of third party.  So we said, OK, we'll not focus that. We would love to add them to the controls. We'll just think about it when we come to third party.  That's what I remember, at least.

1:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I remember now, this is not... OK, we are just rebuilding... we are refactoring our common memory of this right so it's not yes being defensive uh by understanding of what i remember is uh so we have right we have i'm not going to list the whole thing but okay we have policies and then we have controls that are guarantees right right yes okay these are like commitments and policies are guarantees right and we have uh okay cool cool yeah so uh sorry i mean didn't mean to interrupt you just wanted to send this one live yeah this is the actual implementation of current third party management so here you upload the vendor list

3:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I have to dig out the file, for example. File, it has to be in the exact structure we need.  So I like us to go through this flow, just to show you how it looks like currently, so you get a better understanding of how it works and what needs to be changed because if I'm not mistaken, everyone's changed some stuff around from last I heard, so we need to see what.  I double template. You can try to click the click on double template. Is it working? Something went wrong, please try again.  Yeah, we don't have it to see that.

3:32 - A L
  I don't think we ever created it. But the main thing is that if you look at this, it's not the best, I think maybe we can redraw it with steps and everything, but what you do is you ask for an annual spend with your supplier, look at number one, and if not from the accounting system.  And then you select the suppliers more than a predefined or reasonable amount and then you try to end up with a list that's about 20 to 50 suppliers that you're going to.  on your watch list, and those are the ones that you're going to put into the system, not your whole 60,000 supplier base, but your top 10, 20, 30, whichever ones you want.  And then how you want to refine it is based off of looking at sector and country, you want to look at the product and services to see the risk areas, and then any kind of reputational risk.  And then you upload that, and then you have a template where you upload these into the system, and then, and then you go to the next step.  I'm not necessarily saying that this is the right way to do it based off of the feedback. We might have to change it, but this is what's already programmed into our tool.  So we can see what we can reuse. And then if you go to that, you upload the, I guess you press upload, and then it brings you to another section.

4:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'm working on getting a file so that you can upload it and see how it works after you upload it.  Go upload a vendor list, and how do you get to the next part from here? When you uploaded this page changes, because it means you have this is the first time you come in here because you don't have any vendors.  So the whole point was to. to have a step by step guide on how you add vendors and why do you add them and that's why we put like this.  then once you upload, once you have any vendors in the system, there are table appears above this you'll see.  I'm working on it. If you must upload, would you see anything if you go?

5:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, he should.

5:17 - A L
  Yeah, he should get a pop-up. Yeah. Yeah, and then I would say next page without uploading something. Could I see the next page with the thing or no?  I think you probably had some vendors in this in the organization or something like that.

5:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, but so we try. Yeah, you can try, but I doubt it will work. Yeah, you can try, of course.  Okay, no, but then I thought I saw another user man.

5:45 - A L
  Okay, but yeah, and then you get into a list and then because we're like, and then we have like third-party questionnaires, right?  You can actually click on it and then we should be able to get to that like a list. It was like a list of show and then in that it was kind of like we had like a questionnaire where they can send out the questionnaire to the suppliers and then the questionnaire was in there and that they needed to respond and then there was like a section where each person had their own like file on like you know what it can look like.  I don't know how it's weird that we can't get to that here or. Yeah, because the intention was that you need to upload it first.

6:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  So let me let me I'm trying to dig out the file right now. So give me a couple of minutes.  I may be sure you can ask questions if you have them now before we move to showing you everything.  So my current.

6:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, go on. So my current understanding of this is the overall process has three steps we select which third parties we want to track and there's like some logic behind it.  With that we build a list we upload the document and Excel file. it builds a list and then then we'll have a list not of millions but just of a few that we are more interested in.  And then basically. on that list, we start to activate the list, to say. So we send them controls and policies and things that they need to react to and become compliant.  And follow up and you communicate with them.

7:11 - A L
  ideally, you could see AI eventually can replace all of this manual process. It could be like, upload your list, and then we'll help you filter out what are your top 30 risks, because AI helps you do that here, upload it to the system here, OK, deploy the questionnaire.  So a lot of this is like, so this is like what you see now is like extremely like, it's a digital manual process, because this is what people do now, right?  Like I did this in my previous company very manually, right? I didn't have directions. So for somebody who doesn't have experience, they don't even know how to do this.  So this is like, I would say like the, you know, people from zero to 10, 10 being innovated. This is V2, right?  Because you're digitalizing like a very manual process here. And then also right now, like once you go into, once you have your 20 or 30 suppliers in general, unless you  of a supplier management tool, everybody is using Excel, email, MS forms, and trying to put all of this together into a way.  think you like Anya has explained it, you know, in carbon capture. So this is like an attempt to simplify and digitalize the process that it's, that at least it's in the system.  But I eventually, I can easily like replace, replace this, this process or make it a lot faster, I would say.

8:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, cool. So we have, of course, AI is unavoidable. I think we should, before we start, I know we're not doing that now, but we need, we should have like a deeper understanding of how AI would work for our specific case because it all depends in my perspective on the quality of the data we collect.  And that depends not just on forms, but also like the interactions we have, and now we incentivize people to keep things updated.  make it easy for people to use it, and how we can work with the data, right?

9:07 - A L
  No, I'm just saying that even if you look at step one, two, and three on this list, like if we had set up AI correctly, it can like, you just, you know, you ask for the overall spend and then you throw it into AI and then like with a predefined amount, it can like organize the, you know, it can organize the template, right?  So you don't manually have to organize the template and then put that in. You can also ask them to refine by sector, being like, okay, take out all the digital companies and like, know, so AI could help make this just a lot easier.  Same with the risk assessment when we get there, but I agree. I think in the meantime, like we are where we are right now, we need to do a little bit of a manual process.  Our compliance people are happy with the manual process, but eventually to be more relevant and helpful, I think, you know, we have to think about integrating AI, but that could be the future.  The first we need to launch this first part to get going.

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, no, for sure. Okay, we are in agreement. So the first one. Okay, go ahead.

10:07 - A L
  I found it.

10:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I can send it to maybe and you can upload it and we can see further. Okay, yeah.

10:13 - A L
  So you can send it now so then we can get to the next part just so you can see that.

10:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  Well, do you have maybe Excel on your PC? Unfortunately, I do, yes. I'll send you the, so I'll send you a file, but it's a CSV file.  You just need to open it in Excel. Okay, I'll send it to you here. please.

10:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can, it's a bit possible.

10:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Will you send it to me via email via Slack?

10:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  However you prefer. Slack, if you can.

10:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, send it to you on Slack. Okay, this is a CSV. Please fill it in. It's empty, but you just, we can do

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now I need to read.

12:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we don't see your Excel. So if you want to, or if you fill it in, just go to the bottom and upload that file.  If you already filled it in, that's that's fine.

12:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And don't list. Okay. Okay. Okay, let's go. Yeah.

12:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. it working? I don't know what's happening. I don't know. Can you open network tab and see, let me try it.  So can you send, you filled in the file, you just send back the file you filled in. Yeah, yeah, I will send you via Slack.

12:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I think I know what happened.

13:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  My CSV got a little bit weird, so we don't have the best error control here, so we have to make sure for now it's the correct format here.  paste this okay and now i'll send it again um you can do it yourself try to try to upload yourself if it doesn't work then i can test upload list select the file go upload i clicked upload right yeah so so i'll it via yes okay i also got another file i will try first that one with the real examples live example so maybe a second there with me okay now third party upload could it be because of the

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Portuguese characters, yeah, we have some errors again sorry for that but yeah I'll have to check it offline and then we can go back so we can maybe quickly go through it together or maybe we could yeah or we can just go through the design like the design that like Joan I have and at least in our head we've seen it so we know we kind of know how yeah makes sense makes sense okay so opening this thing this shadow step okay so the flow we have but the thing is this this flow I'm about about to show you is different from what we have developed so okay okay before we get into that first we need to select the third part is there's a process that is being fixed for that we know  how it works there's a current like some bugs but this is not a big deal this can be fixed right upload yeah document and in order to help them upload the document uh there's also some rules right some um some recommendations like oh you ask for an overview for procurement and this kind of thing right yeah before we upload we need this thing okay um okay then we build build the list and this is the table right so and then we activate the third parties which means like policies in control pcts right ptc and controls so the difficult thing or  the most core thing about the third parties is selecting them and then accessing them, right? So I have a list which looks like a table and I have A, B, C, D, E and I have I access that third party.  Let's say it's ACME, right? And then I see policies and we see controls, right? Yep. Is this still making sense?

17:54 - A L
  Yeah, that's kind of how we have it. I think I don't know about the policy control part, but yes.  Yeah, no, but this is a core thing. We need to understand and re-agree on this.

18:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because this bit is just a continuation of what you guys already described to me. So yes, we are in agreement with that.  But the idea is that once I have the list, what can I do with the list, right?

18:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can open each vendor, click on the vendor, and see the vendor details. So it's open actually in your page where you can see the whole vendor stuff like name.  You can edit the vendor name. You can edit vendor details there. And there you can also see the vendor submissions.

18:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Vendor details, okay. And vendor, I like the way you describe it, vendor submissions, right? Yeah. So we can assume that vendor details are permanent information.  They don't keep changing their name. They don't keep changing their contacts, right? This is more fixed stuff. And the submissions,  changes all the time like oh they've sent like a form and we need to evaluate this form and the the bottom part is a little bit more dynamic.  It's like the text.

19:14 - Ivan Ćelić
  Come on, Pan.

19:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, perfect. So if this is what we're aiming at, uh what we have here I think is roughly that.

19:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can I can I also throw you or can I go to the flow of this fan in Figma? Can I show it there to you so that at least you can visually how it looks like?

19:42 - A L
  Because I think there's a core strategy I think we need to consider on how we do it because I'm not sure.  There's a point where like you don't go by individual vendor like I don't don't go like vendor A I want to do ABC and B it's more like I want all of our vendors.  do policy I want all of our vendors to do the training and then you see the result on the each individual vendor side so you're yes so that's the the only thing that I think we need to make sure that and then eventually like as a new vendor comes it could be like okay I want to designate the training that they haven't done this and this and this but it's really not by each vendor that you would do the decision it's like okay I want all the vendors to sign off on our policies you guys have to sign off on the policies you know like that but that but that thing is then via the policies and the controls right no I would say that it would be done let me let me show you yeah that's because most compliance people are like when they think about it they think about external stakeholders in a box of like I treat external stakeholders like this and then like controls is more internal stakeholders so even though they're both controls and they're very similar like the mindset of them would be a little bit different yeah so now this is the page you saw right this is the page it just correct yeah you click upload when there list here

21:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  what happens? Okay, this file gets uploaded. Okay. And then ideally, it works.

21:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ideally, this happens.

21:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  It shows up at the top refer page. And this is like vendor list company, PCB, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, with some different stages of some different stuff.  And then below with this, you get the guy below this, but that's not relevant. So it's a guy that's hidden and the table above that's visible immediately.  That's how it currently works. And at the top here, you have the questionnaire. So that's basically, you can think of it like a control, but this is separated out from the other controls.  It's a questionnaire, which when you click, you open a page, you see in this old design, basically it's just to review it and to approve it if I'm not mistaken.  So you can, you can just see it and approve it. And yeah, we are not, we didn't even implement approving for now, but basically you can see here the questionnaire that sent out to all your vendors.  And now, hold on. When, when you click on when you click in this table you go in here you click company a then you go to this page here this is all built this is all but maybe it's not one to one on this design but it's pretty close it's pretty close so so this is this the page we have and here you have all the vendor details that you imported so this and you have added here which you can edit this so when you click then these fields are editable and you click save they are saved so that's my feature yes and then we have to do lists on each vendor we have option to create tasks per vendor so here you can create a task for each of them we have these small pop-ups and models so this all works we did all this and those like right now the only control when we built it was the questionnaire but if you were to like actually do it correctly like and now with more time and thinking it would be also policies and trainings like so that would

23:00 - A L
  in addition to the questionnaire. Those would be kind of the controls for that. So that hasn't been added into kind of the new flow.  We focused on the questionnaire, which can at least be the starting point. But the idea is that they would eventually have like a supplier portal that they can go in.  that's also a sales process, right? Because a supplier wouldn't go into the portal on that they would know about us.  then hopefully that's a third thing.

23:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would say.

23:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  live assembly, like we haven't played portal, we'll probably have another portal. We haven't really built a supplier portal yet either.  there are, but this is what was as a really built.

23:33 - A L
  So there's a lot that's already been built that we can use, but it's not totally put together into the ideal space because it was done so fast, but there is something there.  It's kind of like controls, right?

23:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I understand.

23:45 - A L
  I think we're seeing the same thing from different angles, right?

23:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  just to show you, sorry, just want to complete this and then we can continue. basically here is the list of all the submissions from that vendor in the CFG tab.  Here you have this and some documents. that you can upload for each vendor, and that's it. And I'm done with it.  This is all we have right now for vendors. OK, I think this is great.

24:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this is the thing I was suggesting. I fully agree with this.

24:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK, good.

24:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My point about wish, so why is the questionnaire not type of a control? It is a control.

24:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's a type of control.

24:33 - A L
  We think about in our other internal controls, we have a questionnaire for conflict of interest. We have a questionnaire for what other questionnaire do we have?  We have a ethics survey. It is a questionnaire that we focus it on suppliers. So it is a control.  like a basic control for a supplier is usually a questionnaire that they need to answer where they can attach a lot of different things.  But ideally after that, then it's like, okay, well, based off of the risks from the questionnaire, low-risk people need to read a policy.  High-risk ones that come out of the questionnaire need to do a training. Very high-risk that come out of the questionnaire that they answered has to Yeah, yeah.

25:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry for interrupting, that is clear. I think we've touched on that before. So my point is, I don't understand why the questionnaire is presented in a different section than controls.  I understand that this questionnaire is related to third-party because I get it.

25:37 - A L
  Yeah, like whether or not we have a third-party control part where it's like training, I think it was just put separately up here because it was the only thing that we kind of set for third parties at the time.  I think ideally with the questionnaire, there would be another section. Yeah, I wouldn't mind us having another section or a toggle that says controls, and then that questionnaire, I'd  along with the training, along with the policy are in those three controls. And then those are ones that you can deploy to it, and then you see it within the list.  like, and then the vendor list is like the user management for employees or something like that. I, like, yeah.  So I think it should be on its own on its own external controls, but I don't think it should sit with our other controls because those are external controls.

26:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, which is also another thing we've discussed in the past, right? Separating internal and external controls. OK. By the way, are we unable to?  have vendor list now in the portal.

26:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  can see it now if we go to the same page and you can click on vendor. You can click on all the stuff I showed you right now.  yeah.

26:48 - A L
  Third target management.

26:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, you just uploaded, like, right now, right?

26:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, Borna, Borna, he managed to see it.

26:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is what I see.

26:58 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, you can, you have to enter vendor details. to click three dots and then go into it. It's not polished at all, but it's working.

27:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, perfect. Okay, my point here is basically we have the same model, the same mental model for this, which is a good thing, right?  The only, I think, king in the process is, I think we are not using the same language to describe the same thing, then it feels that we in this agreement, but I don't think we are.  I suppose, where is it? So, yeah, share this step. Okay, so once I have a list of third parties, I need to do things with those third parties, right?  And I need to be able to check the details, like the thing you just showed me, even. So, I fully agree on that.  My point about being able to access whatever policies and trainings and controls that specific supplier is subject to, is that we need to give the compliance officer two ways, two Zoom levels.  We need to give them the option to, I want to send this to a list of 50 suppliers. And we also need to give them the option of, I want to check what specific things are related to this one supplier, Or this one third party.  Do we agree on that? Okay, so we need the high Zoom and low Zoom, right? The high Zoom is the external controls, right?  When we are in the section called external controls, we can see all the controls that external participants are subject to.  when we can check. like 50% of the people the companies we interact with have not sent us the annual update form.  Can I ask a question?

29:14 - A L
  I think it's important.

29:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  Are all external controls third-party controls, Abby? all external controls third-party controls or not?

29:30 - A L
  Not necessarily. Okay.

29:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  What would be an example of a control?

29:38 - A L
  But this is, I think, we're getting into semantics and third-party will, like, 90% of people will think third-party controls are the main ones.  But let's say, like, you're in Transparency Act. I'm thinking off the top of my head right now, right? Okay.  Transparency Act says anybody as a member of community should be able to contact you as a company and within six weeks or something, you are obligated by law to respond to them.  So truly having a system like a whistleblowing system or whatever that a person from externally like from the integrity hub would be able to submit a request or a question that they have or like you know and some way to be gathered that like a whistleblowing mechanism but I would say that like almost like 90% of it is going to be third party and then that's what is considered the biggest risk and that's like if you forget about the community people like you're not going to get if you forget about third party you will get a trouble.

30:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay so now I think it's safe to say then that we can for now put all of third party controls inside of the third party stuff and they can be of type external but they need to also be categorized as third party they probably need to be part of the third party part of the section.

30:46 - A L
  Yeah I think if you call it third party controls that's good because that's where a lot of people go wrong in the industry it's like they have no controls around the third party so it's like we know who they are but we don't have any kind of control whatsoever so our controls are what  make them sign off on a read a policy, we make them do a training and we actually have some questionnaires we follow up with.  So I do feel that it could be redrawn to be more specific on controls and it could just be a pretty like a copy of our other controls in the other section into this current view but I'm not sure but I think that it's uh we should keep it there yeah.

31:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so yeah so we agree that for practical in practical terms for now we know that third party is almost always vendors or partners right yeah okay even if I think you want to bring up okay so so if we let me share the screen another tab okay let's share this tab okay let's play this I think in the past role playing has always been helpful we are in the third party management right and this guy the vendor one has been with us for a while  We trust them we like them, but we need to check like are they like up to date We need to check stuff and we come here and to see the vendor details We come on the ESG status and we see oh last time they sent us that Water consumption form was two years ago.  Oh, we are like on this We need to you know wake these guys up and then there don't be like three dots here and we say End them the form again, right?  This is like an automatic. They're ideally we'd have an automatic And then you get you get a follow-up, but yes, yeah, of course in the future everything is automatic But I mean to be able to automate it to have a good mental model of all it works.  Otherwise it breaks up with places so Everything can be automated in the future, but for now in the manual It's like how we have it.

32:49 - A L
  I think we have it right now when I say automated It's more like you have a task do right like an annual task do So that will be automated and automatically we should have that in our section even like when we do this you  Yeah, I agree.

33:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but yeah, that's a separate thing.

33:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there's this idea and I think this is a very useful concept for us, which like when you go to the shopping mall and there's like an elevator and there's an escalator like the stairs.  Yeah, yeah.

33:15 - A L
  If the power goes out, the elevator becomes useless.

33:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but the escalators do not become useful useless. They did just a little bit cumbersome because the steps are wrong but you can use them right this is called graceful degradation.  Yeah, this principle is what we can be useful in this context, which is in the future, we'll have automation.  Yeah, know that, but he needs to work even without automation. this is the process we are describing. Okay, so we're role playing this vendor one, we know these guys for a while.  And now we've realized, oh, we need to remind them of whatever thing. And the thing is listed here with the status like really old.  And we remind them, hey, send us the form again, please. Right. And this creates a. Ask and shows up on our dashboard, sends an email to them, like the whole thing happens.

34:04 - A L
  Yeah, but I would say that usually as a compliance officer, it would go the opposite. It wouldn't go by each vendor, unless the vendor was flagged for something really bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is just one scenario. mean, we're role-playing the same scenario. this is one scenario. This is more of the rare scenario, I would say, than usual.

34:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, but let's start with the edge cases and then move towards the score. OK. Now let's go to the other scenario, which is like, I need to send this thing out to 50 guys, 50 other people.  So compliance map, controls.

34:43 - A L
  Or I would still go to third party management and go to controls. Like I would still separate the control section for internal and external.

34:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm doing this here because we don't have that right now, but I think we've discussed this before. right now,  just that confirmation that it seems to make sense to separate internal controls and external controls.

35:05 - A L
  Yeah, I think in your role play, ideally, you would be going in the third party management and there would be external controls and then you would go in there and then you would kind of see a duplicate of that in there.

35:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I think we need to have, I'm not sure, I thought you were, you're going there, so maybe I'm missing this to you, but controls, external controls, third party controls have to be in the third party tab.  They can look the same as part-time controls or have the same feeling, but they probably should be in that part there.  Because I think that they're used to, from what I understand, the compliance officers are used to have that separate and make them more logical.

35:46 - A L
  don't look at controls as a whole thing, you look at what are the stakeholders you're managing at this time.  I'm managing internal stakeholders, so I need to do it this way. So we could do the content area and then rename it.  content areas and that like there but like it is a mental map it's like you don't go back and forth between then like controls you don't kind of look at controls as a whole you look at who you're working with as a whole and then you do the controls based on that so I think it's important that like when they go into the third-party management box everything they need around third parties is in that box and they stay in that box until they're done with that So what is the box for the internal?  So the internal is more like the internal controls so we can call it like internal controls and then like we can rename it like call that box instead of controls call it internal controls and then for stakeholder management we can do external controls third-party right like we can also rename it to make it make more sense but it's like you spend most of your time on your employee like ideally like you spend a lot of time on your employee base which is where you have more of this right but then like but then there is like a big third party  management that you want to do. So, yeah.

37:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, this is not a difficult thing to do to put the internal controls, the external controls inside of third-party management.  So, my being need to pick about this is just because it's very easy for us to make like a quick architecture decision here and then being much harder to untangle that if it doesn't work in the future.  So, we need to stress this sooner. So, my thinking is the reason behind, why do we have a compliance map as an analogy is to guide people through the process and the compliance map in my understanding.  There's attention in it, which is it relates to both a linear process like getting started with these things and also a cyclical process, which is things we keep doing all the time, right?  This is why it starts with risk assessments. needs to start with risk assessment, but at some point it stops being linear and becomes a spiral, right?  You keep repeating the same things over and over again. So in that respect, if we create a section for supplies third party, are there risks in the risk assessment that relate to supplies in third parties?  For instance, this is just an example.

38:25 - A L
  Yeah, because, yeah, because so should they be inside of third party?

38:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, well, we are doing risk assessment.

38:36 - A L
  So if you think about like that narrowing down to the 30 to 50, that is technically a risk assessment what we just did was different.  So yeah, so it's like if we want this almost like we add like internal like on the top for risk assessment policies, trainings and communication and then we go external and then within there there's like risk assessment for third parties because that's kind of what we just did there to name it there.  And the name policies, procedures, training, communication. don't really need communication. Well, you could have policies, training, communication with third parties.  You want to send them quarterly communication. So this content area, we could also rename it internal content area and have a similar one external content area within third party.  So it can be kind of duplicated within it, but third party is a smaller version of it. Yeah. You need 21 points, you can have a lot more policies internally with the supplier.  have one policy, which is supplier code of conduct. You could have a lot of different trainings internally, but you'd really only have one supplier code of conduct training.  And then questionnaires, you could have so many different questionnaires like controls and different things. Suppliers, you really only have one, which is that questionnaire.  So it's like a smaller version of the employee base one, but it's very similar to how you would manage it.

40:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the fact that we agree to put external controls inside of third-party management, is that it?

40:15 - A L
  Yeah, or like supplier controls within the third-party management, right? If you want to be more specific, because these are supplier-specific controls that we're doing.

40:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but this is really dangerous, because the point is, in a few months, we'll have controls from people that send us forms, requests for information, stuff like that, and they're not suppliers.  Yes. Where will that thing go? We shouldn't create another section called...

40:40 - A L
  We'll have another box if you look at the compliance map. It's like suppliers, and then the next one on the back is external stakeholders, other external stakeholders on the compliance map.

40:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so compliance map, this one? Yeah.

40:59 - A L
  Okay.

41:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, in the future, if we need to, we'll place these controls inside of this thing, right? Like let's say controls regarding people requests for information.

41:18 - A L
  Exactly.

41:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah.

41:23 - A L
  And then we used to have a box that said like customers, like our own customers, if we wanted to have controls over that, we deleted that box just because I just felt like it was a little too much.  like according to the Norwegian transparency act, you would also do, you know, sanctions checks on your customers, you know, and you could do that and add it.  It is like, okay, well, then that could be added into other external instead of having other external and then customers, but we didn't have a box for customers that we deleted.

41:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay, so what have we gotten from this? This, yeah, so basically the big decision, and this was important, but the big decision was the way to, as a compliance officer, to access the controls.

42:19 - A L
  I think we need to rename it internal.

42:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I think that's, I think that's maybe confusing. You may be wrong, but these controls is not like all controls.  This is just internal control. So this box is basically just a small subsection of control. maybe that's what you're trying to get that.

42:34 - A L
  Yeah, internal controls. Yeah, yeah, of course.

42:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  Do we need to rename both of these?

42:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm having trouble to follow because we keep speaking over each other. So what should I rename? can rename it right now.

42:55 - A L
  So where it says controls right now where the cursor is. Right there. That should actually be called internal internal controls.  Because then it's like that's only for employees there. Whereas and then and then external controls would sit in the supplier one.  So I think what needs to be redesigned probably from is how do we move the internal control? Like how do we do external controls within the supplier one that makes sense?  You know like maybe a risk assessment maybe you know when we go into the supplier box you know maybe we should name you know if you if we want to like just lift the controls right the first one is risk assessment step one and then they go to that thing and break down the risk assessment so yeah smaller one and then step two is like policy training communication questionnaire right and then and then you have another section where you toggle and then you see everyone's responses right maybe that needs to be the way that it's redrawn to to match.

43:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  From what I understood now I think you're trying to get at this. I don't think I may be correct if I'm wrong I don't think that  compliance officer will ever need to see all the controls in one place and they will never be interested in both internal external and whatever in the same place so in that way I don't think we need to like have all the controls in control box so we need to separate it out by cat we can call the categories of controls or types of controls one being internal control that you just renamed second one will be supplied control that we are part of third party and then the third one will be probably this other external like for people outside of company visible that's I would say that that division should be the key here and I think that's their most interesting idea got it agree with that perfect okay good my okay okay now that now this is I think if we there's a there's an history to this project right one of the things that I think

45:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we've been doing often is every time we, not every time, a lot of times that we face a wall of abstraction, we create a very specific solution for that thing.  And then later on, we realize that we have like three kind of the same ways of doing the same thing, but they're not the same thing.  it generates complexity, not only for development and design, but also for the user's way of thinking about this. So my perspective is if we, I know this is cumbersome, right?  I understand that. if we have a big list and I'll need to finish this thought, I'll need like five minutes to finish this thought.  If we have a big list of controls and they are flagged internal or external, we make sure that our way of addressing controls is always the same, is always the same flow.  And then later, it's very easy to slice this and say controls that have the flag internal show up at this section, controls that have the flag is external show up at this section.  And they, we now have two separate, not overwhelming lists controls right this is a scenario the other scenario is we decide right now to separate them like internal and external controls or and later create perhaps you know society controls I don't know and as we do this these things start to develop their own in their own way we create their own buttons their own styles their own phones this is what's been happening like this is the project has happened which is normal like we create specific solutions for specific problems and then a month on the line realize oh this design is completely different in we need to go back and redesign the thing because it evolved again the live of its own right so from a user perspective I understand that we should not have a list of 200,000 controls for the same thing I agree with that okay but I also think that's very easy to kind of fix on an MVP scale which is just put a filter internal non-internal internal external and just a list  compresses immediately right? Is this making sense so far?

47:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes.

47:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, because do you guys understand my resistance to the idea of creating another section that will evolve in its own way and then eventually I don't understand how this affects the decision.

47:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'm not sure how this sounds to me like a technical decision behind the scenes and I would say that we are now talking about how we represent these controls.  So if we, for example, behind the scenes do, like you said, have the controls that can easily be filtered, what stops us from throwing the external in one page called external controls and then showing the internals once in the another page?  Why is it that because we don't necessarily have to have it like you said, we can do that. We can have a filter table that can either be clickable external internal, but we can also have it filtered by page.  you click on this page, you come in and you see external ones, you click here, you come to see, you click on external ones, maybe you're missing something, but I don't see the complexity.  I agree with that, I agree with that.

48:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think my point is we've often solved architecture, visual design things.

48:20 - A L
  I hear you and I think that, I think but we're not so far along that we're not able to like, for example, I think if we do external controls within third party suppliers, we can still create the same format that we had in the other ones, right?  Like in the same policy procedures trainings and just kind of copy the look and then just like, you know, put the different ones, you know, based on that.  So I don't think we're like, we're so new in this that it hasn't, but I agree, like we have been looking at it.  I think it's a good reminder to like, to keep this in the back of our head as we do it.  But I think we're not too far away because we can use some of the things of policies, trainings, communications, you know, risk is, I actually now think about  We should what what what what what we did before about like you know that those questions step one step two step three That is a risk assessment So we actually just like if you think about all the controls that are listed you could have risk assessment And then that's where you start right and then it goes step one step two step three and then you know check the policies training So then you can use the control what we've already created for internal controls.  You can also use that as the starting point for For suppliers right they go into most likely control page to begin with you know what I mean Okay, you mean external controls the one we start right now you when you click on suppliers it goes to the step I'm two or less right and that doesn't like that doesn't look like our current internal control That's like it's a totally like a different world, right?  Yes, but if you wanted to step into our kind of similar to our current role if you would go into a controls page And then in that You would have risk assessment as your first control  And then when you click on risk assessment, it would have step one, step two, step three upload, because that is a risk assessment that you're taking all of your different suppliers.  Yeah, but we said that we will not mix the internal consoles, we'll keep risk assessment as a separate part.

50:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  when you click on risk assessment, it will open up.

50:15 - A L
  No, assessment. I think we still need risk assessment. That box you see right here is a much bigger process that will also include third party.  But like within third party itself, you have risk assessment, like its own internal risk assessment. There's overall global company risk, and then there's process risk.  Do you know what I mean? So you can still have a risk assessment within third party, because it's still a process that you need to go through.  And this is what we did already, because technically what we did that is step one, step two, step three, that is a risk assessment.  We just didn't name it as that. We named it as a way to reduce the numbers that you actually have to work with.  Okay, but that's external. risk assessment.

51:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  That is a risk assessment, like literally what we are external, right?

51:06 - A L
  Yeah, so then if you go into the controls box, then maybe you would have, like if you look at, I don't know, if you go to our controls, can you go to our controls page or, yeah, the view our internal controls?  If you like governance or something like that, they can go into this page and it could be, and most likely it's going to be like ongoing, it'd be like annual, like risk assessment or ongoing, it'd be like risk assessment.  And then you click on risk assessment, it goes to step one, two, three. And then annual is, you know, training, you know, annual is like a policy review or something like that, you know, and that I know.  And then so it kind of looks like this, but then it goes through and you go up, as a job that has it or even like, then you have like the submission request or something like that.  like, then you end to see all of the, all of the wouldn't be part of controls?

52:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  Or would it be part of internal controls?

52:04 - A L
  This is part of external controls, right?

52:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Okay. Okay. I just want to, before we move on to that, risk is my whole thing. I just wanted to ask you, what would you do, what would you suggest?  Just want to go one step back on this control stuff that you had your whole, you wanted to say that we need to...

52:25 - A L
  My whole speech.

52:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. So I'm interested in what would you propose as a solution to that. Okay.

52:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I would just have controls, internal controls and external controls side by side. Okay.

52:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Not inside of stakeholder management.

52:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm going to give you a silly example. Okay. Really basic example. Let's say we have risk assessment internal.  Okay. And we also have risk assessments external, right? It could be here, side by side, right? it's mentally screwed.

53:13 - A L
  I know what you mean, Jao, but this is like, as a compliance officer, it just like throws me so off, like, we don't work this way.  Like, it's like, like kind of scared as you, I know what you mean. And I, I, you know, like on a, on piece of paper, it makes sense.  as a compliance officer working in an industry, go by people and like, you know, what are we doing around these groups of people and these activities?

53:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in that case, shouldn't we, like, instead of having the toggle ESG, have the toggle internal external at the top?

53:47 - A L
  You can, or you can have the toggle even on the top, like, like this, this whole section that you see here is internal.  And then on the bottom half is external or something like that, you know, like, if we want to do, but I don't, I don't I feel like

54:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll defer to some expertise for sure.

54:04 - A L
  Yeah, but no, but no, you mean, but I just like, but the way that we work is like so by subject and by the stakeholder group, it's like, to suddenly go like external controls and you're like, what are the external controls and then and then you have third party.  It's a mental map for a compliance officer. doesn't. By control. They're not being like, I'm doing with this kind of assessment across all of them at once.  It's more like, okay, I'm dealing with these takers. I'm going to do all of these controls. So it's a, I hear what you're saying, but it's like mentally as a person working in this, it doesn't.

54:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Joe, but we can still have the same just in different books. you propose the external book, we write an extra internal one, which I agree with you, makes sense, but also makes sense for what habits are.  It's important what they see as a compliance officer, but that books that external control. can just be somewhere hidden inside of third-party page.  And that's it. We can show all the third external controls or third-party controls inside of it. So basically, we get the same.  It just wouldn't be mapped the same on the compliance map page. And I think we are more or less all on the same page there.  But we just wouldn't have it on this page here as an internal external controls or filter at the top.  We would just have it inside of third-party because they as officers expected to be there. We have a next door to it or something.

55:33 - A L
  So it's the third section.

55:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  then it's in the third-party section.

55:36 - A L
  then it's like right next to third-party controls. So it could be like third-party overview. And then the next to it is third-party controls.  But at least it's in the same thing so that they know where to find it. You just suddenly have external controls on the control line.  And then it's a little bit confusing there.

55:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we agree that there's controls that happen. inside of stakeholder management, right? Yes.

56:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, I would say it like this, controls happen inside of stakeholder management and they happen inside of internal controls.  The name says it itself, but internal controls would be called internal management, then we would say controls are internal management and internal.  What if we, sorry, as I was cutting you off, instead of stakeholder management, we call it external controls.

56:26 - A L
  So, we have internal controls, internal, and then instead of stakeholder management, we have external controls. We call it supplier third party, because that's an external control.  Is that what works better, like, would that make more sense?

56:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Still processing, so you're saying this, right? External controls?

56:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  and then it would, we would remain the one of both internal controls. You don't have to do it, but just...

56:52 - A L
  Yeah, the one on top would be called internal controls instead of controls.

56:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  on both, yeah, on both these places. Yeah. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

57:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so like internal external. Yeah, can work.

57:18 - A L
  And then you go to third party and then you go to the controls on third party on how you manage it.  Yeah. That actually probably makes more sense to like if you're like you're doing the work and you're doing the control work.  Could that be? Does that make more sense, your head or? Yeah, I think so. But the external control on the right, that box would still go back to the original one, like other stakeholders.  And that's the third party. yeah.

57:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one?

57:53 - A L
  Yeah, that would go to other stakeholders that go to the original name like this. Yeah, I actually like that better because I think that you're very clear that you have controls for the supplier third party, which is why you're dealing with them.  But, but okay, so we enter when we enter this place, right, we go into controls kind of.

58:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's Go ahead, go ahead.

58:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, I just wanted to skip and say it doesn't have to look like controls. cannot have its own look and feel like vendor list or something, but controls are somewhere in there.  So it doesn't necessarily have to be like I said, but yeah, please just continue. So let's say I open this, I'll open this.

58:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I refer to the names.

58:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Click the link in the meat, that's the easiest one. You can manually enter it, but you have it in chat.

58:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not this part, I click, I click. I click on this thing and then I'm taking to. This thing, and now I have a vendor list, right?  And I can check an individual vendor, but I can also send a reminder to all vendors. And this is the reminder for the questionnaire, the intake questionnaire, so to say, okay.

59:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

59:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And then I send a reminder. You can call it a control, right?

59:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  But this is actually, this questionnaire is a control.

59:27 - A L
  Yeah. Let's call it a control.

59:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

59:29 - A L
  In the risk assessment part it's a control. Okay. In a way. In a way it is.

59:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  yeah. Okay. I understand. You mean uploading vendors is a control itself, right? Yeah.

59:41 - A L
  yeah. You went, yeah, it's a risk assessment. it's kind of a, it's uh, it's kind of a context whether or But let's, let's.  It's an official process. You have done a risk assessment as part of what we've done. And we should actually call it out just so we can show that we've done it.  Because that's actually the right way. Okay, good job for your demo. this question

1:00:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  is also a control just so you are on the same page. Yeah, it is a question.

1:00:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay. so, do you see it, right? There's different types of controls and one of them is new render questionnaire, correct?

1:00:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I'm not necessarily new. can just say render questionnaire.

1:00:38 - A L
  And then another control can be like a meeting where you take meetings and you have a meeting with them and you take the notes on it and then another control can be policy sign off and then another control can be training sign off.

1:00:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so give me a second because I think this relates to a mental model if we've before where is that thing just a second 45 okay so many 45s not this mapping session okay okay just a second this will make sense okay share this step okay so we have four motions for verbs in the whole 45 platform right we collect you collect data  which can be forms and the acknowledgments on the policies and stuff like that. We manage the audience, which is the internal employees and the externals, like we get their contact details, we add people, we take people out, we update information.  We track stuff, we track like tasks and status are all this policy has been signed up for a long time and stuff like that.  And we create reports on that, right? Is this making sense?

1:02:30 - A L
  Yep. Okay.

1:02:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the controls are a mix between, a mix between that collection, because I collect the OK or the form or the document from that person.  And I track that when that was done, right? So to me, it makes sense that, yes, the new new or the vendor questionnaire is is a control is a type of control actually the fact that you've sent a policy is also a part of control isn't it so okay I think that's it perfect uh share this okay so I think to me I don't know about you to me what could help is to have like a list of all the controls to understand what they relate to yeah but there's only like for a third party you mean so it's like I can name it now like one is uh policy you sign off on a supplier code of conduct that the company has like I'm telling or you need to abide by my supplier principles here's a policy confirm that you've read it so that's one the other one is um training you have to and this is usually for more me

1:04:00 - A L
  and risk ones. You need to actually take my training which is a more detailed policy that I have but a longer thing that you need to confirm that you've read it and like done the training.  Then the third one is like a meeting. Oftentimes it's like you have a meeting first to discuss what you need to do but you have to have a meeting every six months or one year just to like talk through some of the changes and maybe you had to like you know you like maybe as part of the meeting this like hey you need to make some internal policies I want to see in the next meeting.  So there's follow-up and then the other one is the supplier questionnaire but the supplier questionnaire is often kind of like a risk assessment too because the risk it's like the supplier questionnaires you send it out to everybody they need to confirm it and through that there's going to be risks that come up and then like you know some will pass totally fine other ones will be like they have no policy they haven't looked at human rights they haven't done this then it'll trigger either you have to have a meeting where you're gonna have to have a policy or you're gonna have to do a training but there might be some like you know Jiao Inc has like has everything already they already have a policy they already have an internal training  They really meet all of these different requirements. have ISO whatever then I might be like well Xiao ink doesn't need to do anything They just need to like confirm a policy or maybe we put them so much at low risk They don't even need to do anything because they've been so well right like That those are the main good things you have to do with the Supply and then you just need to follow up And that was one of the things that Anya was saying that it's very difficult to follow up because like you might have a meeting I might have a meeting with Xiao ink and we had like a nice email about it a year later passes like We forgot what that meeting was about.  There's no way to track it I don't know what he agreed in that meeting to find out You know like whereas if you had a portal you could put your notes in you could agree on it You get a reminder, you know if Xiao in that meeting said who's gonna do a policy internal training Like is there any kind of follow-up in that you would see it in the training there?  So that's that's kind of the main process okay, so Let me just lock this thing up.

1:05:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if I am a new if roleplay this, Evan's favorite words. Ivan, you are a compliance officer, and I'm a new vendor, okay?  And there's four things that we need to do for me to be like fully vetted, right? The first thing is that I need to abide by the suburb code of code.

1:06:24 - A L
  The first thing most likely, like, if you were like a compliance officer, you would like, you would, okay, let me see, like a high level.  Ideally, the base thing was like, like, if you just want to write this down, one, and I'm skipping this right now, but we're just discussing partnerships, one, you would actually run your whole supplier base through a sanctions or pep screening, politically exposed screening.  And this is like very fast, you would run everybody through it, and any flags where you would take out for the list, but most likely it wouldn't.  So that's, so like you take out the flags and you get those. That's one list. And then you would do the risk.  assessment, which is that process that we did is like, okay, now you have 60, you know, 1000, you take out the 100 that like popped up with pep because you're gonna have or like 20 that popped up with pep, you need to do something.  And then the second one is then you risk tier them based off of their size and amount of spend and everything that we had in our steps right there.  And then you would send them a questionnaire.

1:07:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That would be the next step.

1:07:23 - A L
  would send them a questionnaire or you'd either do research on your own and like, you know, or you would just send them a questionnaire if you don't have time to do research on your own.  And then depending on the questionnaire results that you would risk tier them more again. And then they would say some of the results are like, okay, you should do a training.  could, you know, you can do a policy sign off. Like, I would like, I would probably like, if I had the right tools, I would just all of them do a policy sign off because that's like a really easy thing.  I would say the ones who came back with like medium tier have to do training. The ones who came back really bad who have like nothing.  I would say we have to have a meeting every. six months where you tell me and show progress on what you're working on.  So that's kind of how it would work and that would be the process and the following up on it.

1:08:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if we think about the whole work of a compliance operation body that will manage this, there's parts of that work that happen inside of the platform and parts that do not, right?  Over time it makes sense to assume that this range increases and we occupy a larger bit of what they do, right?  Yeah, okay, yeah, this one.

1:08:39 - A L
  We're kind of at the supplier questionnaire, but that whole process, like we just had a meeting with a KYC company to have a partnership that we can be like, hey, work with them and we get a cut, whatever, but that can be outside of our process room now.  I think for our initial one, it's more about like that risk assessment, the digitalization of that follow-up process is what the biggest pain point is for compliance officers.

1:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so that's the realm we are discussing for now within like our platform. So we begin by sending, like it doesn't matter what happened outside.  Like this bit doesn't happen, doesn't matter, and this bit doesn't matter. So when they touch 45, when the new supplier touches 45, what is the first thing we send?  A questionnaire, I would think.

1:09:26 - A L
  Oh, I think we need to validate this, but I would say the first thing we do is that like, maybe your control 0.5 is the risk assessment, because then you're narrowing it down, right?  And then the control would be the send the supplier a questionnaire. Some first controls like, oh gosh, the caveat and more and more is some people like to do that in the checks themselves before the questionnaires.  Like in my previous company, I had interns go in and scour the company name plus corruption plus whatever on Google to try to find out as much as they could before we send out the questionnaire, just to have background checks and to risk to hear them.  I think we could skip it. We want to let us see if we can get away with skipping it by talking with our pilots, but and then just go straight to the supplier questionnaire.

1:10:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I agree with your idea of skipping it because I think for this, for the stage of the company right now, for the stage of 45 right now, we need to be opinionated.  We need to say we care about this, we don't care about that because we don't have enough scale.

1:10:21 - A L
  Yeah, I think if we do this knowing that there are other ones and seeing if it can pass with some of our pilots, then I think it's fine.  But I think they will agree with this. This is kind of, I do need to jump off in three minutes to meet with Talonore, but like supplier questionnaire, you send it out depending on the results.  Maybe there's a risk, a new one in between is like a risk tiering. Like it's like they, they do the supplier questionnaire.  Ideally in the supplier questionnaires, like do you have a policy about human rights? Do you care about child labor?  What are you doing? Right? There will be like some kind of scoring that will say like, if you got, you know, five plus answers, you have to do a policy.  If you've gotten I don't know if we want to go that far because you're getting to Rolls Royce and risk tiering and whatever, but like through the answer, there should be like a severity quote-text, right?  Like not everybody needs to go through the same or we can just say like we've made it the tool so easy now.  These are our risk ones. Everyone's just going to go through the same controls. Everyone's going to do the training.  Everybody's going to do the policy because we made it so easy for people to do it. But in the past you would have been like, okay now at this 30, these top five are our biggest ones.  So we're going to have a meeting. These five are going to have a training because you would do it because of like just the manual nature of it.  It was so difficult. But now maybe through our tool it's like effort. Everybody does it. doesn't matter what you respond on the questionnaire.  have been designed that you have been designated as a risk tiered company. yes, yes.

1:11:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry for Kachip because you have the two minutes now. What would be the best way for us to end this with no, not a lot of open loops?  I think I've agreed on putting external controls inside of its own section, and we've also have clarity now that there's at least these controls here and we also understand that the vendor questionnaire is a type of control that could potentially show up in a control list.  Do we agree on that?

1:12:20 - A L
  Yeah and the risk management process that we have step one, step two, step three already in our tool that can be called a risk management control.  So if you think about before the supplier questionnaire, there could be another yellow box that says risk assessment for suppliers and that's already built into our tool.  We just rename that section called risk assessment because that's what you do first is you do a risk assessment and then you send them the supplier questionnaire and that's also a control itself that you're looking at what is the biggest risk that you have.  So I think like in terms of I need to jump off but like to be able to draw this up in a way and we can have another call tomorrow.  And that helps on that to back tomorrow. But maybe we can have a call like 2 30 to 3 30 to discuss it.  But if Romeo can start to draw something up, I think it's.

1:13:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, I think there's stuff on the, on the bligiera that Romeo can start to draw. But I don't think you should start to draw this stuff up before we get like the architecture of it.  Right. Although otherwise, we will be spending hours that you could use for.

1:13:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can we say that the vendor details page will be in all our possible versions of the system? Maybe he can start with that, for example.  I like that. Yeah, I like that.

1:13:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe that one could be.

1:13:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  He just need to redesign to be honest, just so that it fits the new look and feel it. You saw it looks ugly currently in our live app.  we just need to maybe he can start with those things that we have for sure. And then we can iron out this whole page for the third party and stuff.  I like that. I think that's a good starting point.

1:14:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK.

1:14:05 - A L
  All right. OK, OK.

1:14:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, then I sent you a job.

1:14:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  have like an hour tomorrow.

1:14:11 - A L
  I sent you the meeting to try to solve. At that time, really can't.

1:14:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a time I cannot make. If we can do it like one hour later or one hour sooner, I'm fine.  But at that time, I cannot.

1:14:25 - A L
  So it's going to be difficult because I'm in meetings. I might be able to move it one hour or like, could you do 1 PM our time?

1:14:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can. OK, let me try to move some meetings so that it's at 1.

1:14:43 - A L
  And then we can try to close this off so that it could be designed soon. OK, all right. Got it.  OK, thank you.

1:14:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, you.
