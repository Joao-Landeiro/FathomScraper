0:05 - Mau
  I didn't eat lunch.

0:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm, uh, what is my camera working? I see me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's weird. Okay. I can't see myself, but that's okay.  At least we're off here, right? Because I don't know if I you on coming. No, he wants not on the list.  right. So where are we? Yeah, how do you want to do this?

0:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me show my screens.

0:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  okay.

0:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just as a recap, Marisa and I were also spoke briefly, but just So we've been having the sessions and we've used these sessions mostly to plan out the controls part, at least in the last few ones, and after the last conversation we had, which was on Tuesday, I think, Wednesday, we noticed that we would have to start talking about perhaps broader themes of what happens after the testing, right?  And so let's explore that right here. I don't have a specific agenda for that, but you can start by, there's a list of people, the list of companies that we're testing  Now, in the pilot phase, when is the next phase? Or do we know, what is the next phase after the pilot phase?

2:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They convert and they're paying, they turn into paying customers. Okay. Okay.

2:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And. Okay. So there's two aspects on the pilot, right? One of them is collecting information and the other one is letting them like try out the thing.  It's like a trial in a way, right? Okay. Did I freeze?

2:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No.

3:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I have a question right now, I just came back from the gym and didn't have time to change it, sorry.

3:13 - Mau
  And it's very, very, very hot here in it's painfully hot, but my first question about turning those pilot customers into paying customers.  Are you thinking about, you know, just fraction, you know, the payment types of the platform is just like, it's just paying by modules or paying by the whole or like small users, medium users, large users, I don't know, just questioning what comes to mind.  Well, we have no idea, like, so we have to remember, like...

4:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  got a lot of these pilot customers before we had a product, right, and even knew what we knew the product was going to be.

4:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think my challenge is, I kind of agreed once. So there wasn't like a point of like, once you've done this risk assessment part, then you convert or once you've done the E part that you convert.  Like the pilot agreements are so vague, it's like once we're on MVP, then you convert. an MVP is might differ in what people's opinions are, right?  But all of them are pretty good relationship that we have.

4:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can be like, okay, we're at the point where you need to, you know, do that.

4:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think that, yeah, so we don't have, but in their agreement, like, you know, if you think about pricing, the pricing is like between like 3,500 euro for the cheapest one and probably 6,500 euro ARR for the most expensive one.  for, and these are like how we kind of price it and saying like, You get the introductory price at these prices in exchange for case studies and my referrals, kind of like that.

5:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right. Okay.

5:10 - Mau
  So, so can you repeat?

5:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sorry, Marius, can you repeat the numbers?

5:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't quite get them. Like 3500 for the cheapest and then like 6500 euro. Okay, keep going.

5:39 - Mau
  I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself to Brighton. Hi, Brighton.

5:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice to meet you.

5:44 - Mau
  you.

5:48 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan (fortifai.co)
  It doesn't have the chance to talk before.

5:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But Brighton is also looking into the overall pricing and I think we need to work with some like consultants.  They have with like what pricing and are they really actually willing to pay on it and how did yeah, um, so we're going to be doing a market research soon with some finance interns from Norway to call up CFOs and try to get some more insight on how much they're really, so that's coming up soon.

6:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if you have any questions you want us to add around that, like we can also do that.

6:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So, yeah.

6:28 - Mau
  Yeah, it's just I'm just thinking ahead in terms of marketing steps and also sales steps. So how to convert them, you know, or at least you've had a couple of months, three or four clients, for example, that would be nice.  Not in terms only to test the platform and make it bigger, but at the same time to market that we have this, then this company, not only as a pilot testers, but also as a customers.  We have to. So it's non-negotiable by June, some of these pilots need to cover like otherwise we won't get to seed rounding seed funding like so the more we can get converting like the more of these 12 that convert the more likelihood we'll get seed funding if none of these 12 convert then we will not we can't even go for seed funding because it shows that our product isn't worthwhile because nobody want to pay for it so it's quite clear that you know we have to get them on board yeah I think that that could be one of the questions for the pilot testing phase is like what will make you convert as a customer you know what's missing what's next or how is the budget for this or do you have budget for this or not for this or

8:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  agreement is like we set a price beforehand that they agree that they'll pay if they convert. So they already know that, but the question is like are they willing to convert after you know third party management and we don't fill out risk assessment because that's all they need and they don't need risk assessment so they're happy to just take it or are they going to be like we need to have this full thing in essence before we're willing to pay for it but at the same time it's like so that's kind of what we need to figure out but I have a feeling like what I put in there is kind of like the basic requirements you know you should have an audit trail you should have a reporting mechanism you should have a dashboard like so what I'm putting out there is like my idea of the MVP and I don't feel like I'm too off from the market but we might have some friendly pilots that be like okay this is good enough for now I know you need to get some you know thing in okay we'll convert to just because we know that is building in the right thing or it could be like I really like this first one of policies procedures and trainings like that's enough to convert right

9:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so one of the things that it seems to stand out from this is that we have a couple of variables.  need to start to fix a little bit, even though we have flexibility but just to experiment more consistently on.  So one of the exercises that I always work for this kind of situation is we can take a little bit of time on that.  think it would be useful. Is that we make a list of the things we know about each of these things, the things we think we know and the things we realize.  don't know, right? So I'll give you an example. So what's this, this, this, medium, okay. Okay, so the things we know are in green, the things we suppose are in yellow, the things we do not know are in red, okay?  And now we're talking about the pilot stage, right? So one thing that we know about the pilot stage for sure is we need to convert pilots, correct?  Okay. What else do we know for sure about this?

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We need the pilots to use the tool, we need the pilots to use the tool to be able to decide whether or to convert.

11:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we have a specific line about juice. I feel the earlier, but yeah, yeah, the latest. Okay, what else?

11:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well, we know that we need more content in order to get them to convert, but how much more is not uncertain.

11:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. And it's also something that you have just complimented something that you said is like, I'm not a specialist, that's my, that's why my question comes up.  Is. Let's say that we have a scenario where all the platform, all the app is already done. I know that you have an idea of implementation that would be 45, 60 days to implement the whole platform in the future when everything is done.

12:25 - Mau
  But of course, we have to consider the differences between companies in terms of the cultural aspects about understanding the SG and also all the processes that are already there, or training people and everything, not only for the compliance, training them for the platform.  So my point is, in terms of marketing the sales, I think something that I know is we have to make sure  sure that we know that the implementation phase, onboarding phase, could be very easy for them to apply.

13:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then I think that would be a converting point as well, you know, because I didn't mean to cut you off, but we're literally talking about this with one of the users, the pilot users, who also are investors.

13:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then she was like, I'm not a subject matter expert, I'm not sure I understand where I'm supposed to go or what I'm supposed to do.  And I told her, like, yes, we made a decision on this one to get it out, to not have all of that stuff in, but we do like because we're in between like people who know it and people who not know it.  we made a conscious decision to go for people who know it because it's the fastest, right? But then eventually we would need to make it so it's on you like as a user can be onboarded.  So that is like on the list of many things to do that we need to do, right? Okay, just just adding to

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's good. Okay, sometimes the easiest things to fill in are the green column and the red column, because we think we know.  But sometimes we think we know or we think we don't know and we're actually in the yellow column. And the riskiest thing is that when we think we know but we actually we kind of know, okay.  So an assumption here is, I think this is perhaps an assumption, this maybe this is yellow and not green.  Okay, let's think.

15:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  with a pencil instead of a pen, right?

15:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's just entertain this idea for a second. Our assumption is that we can only convert when they use it, right?  That's what we're saying here. Is it possible that there's a way that we convert them without them using it, like new clients?  Because we have these pilots, but we can also know for other clients, right? Because that would shorten the sales.  Are you talking about current pilots or like new ones?

15:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think maybe if you had like, if we had a very much of a demo of a full product, then they might not need to be able to test it and use it.  Yes, but I think in this current pilot, to convert the existing pilots, they would want to test it out and use it.  Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

15:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the thing is, let's imagine we arrive at June, and we've sold this to other companies that were not  initial pilots, right? Would that be a problem? No, I think that's fine.

16:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think that would be a good thing, right?

16:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're finding ways of selling this for other The green point is like we need the pilots to use the tool to decide.

16:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think like if you go by that sentence, yes, that you need the pilots to decide these current pilots, they will require the use of the tools.  But in the future, yes, could we become a product-led growth company and that maybe, yeah, or like have a seven-day window where they can like, I think like that and all of them have because like, you know, seven-day window where you can try it and then you have to decide within seven days or something like that.  Yes, I think that could be a possibility.

16:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that be the ideal possibility if I may.

16:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

16:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Okay. One of the things that we, I think this is an assumption, sorry, I think that the, need more content is an assumption.  Maybe it isn't more content, maybe like if we nail the onboarding for a specific part, let's say like, so it's just entertaining a thought.  If we do policies, proceed, proceed trainings and communications like we have now, and then we put it on a amazing onboarding, there's a possibility that that would be enough for them to convert, maybe not these ones, but other ones, right?  So the assumption that we need more content, the only way to deal with that is a lot of work and maybe that maybe we have other leverage points that we are not considering that now I don't know what they are, but it's just worth to consider.  Because maybe the trick, the final objective is to close market more clients, right? That's that's more important than developing a tool.  we can, we are developing a tool to close more clients.

18:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think I think that's kind of a both right, like we like, we have 12 pilots right now, correct, none of them convert.  And then we go, Oh, but we can have this thing that a product like growth, we can sell that that won't work, right?  They'll be like, your product sucks, because you already had 12 in your pipeline, and you were able to convert them.  So these 12 that we have in the pipeline are key to like, we have to close them. And then, yes, and then and in order to close them, I think they will ask for maybe more than to say if we decide to make it a content management company, like like that, right?  But I think that like, so I think that we still need to close them and we still need to create content to satisfy these 12 and to move over and I feel that these 12, we have 12, they're not, it's not like one or two, it's like 12 different companies.  If we can see what they're willing to convert with, I think we'll have an understanding of what the market also wants from there.  But yeah, I guess that's my point. don't think we can necessarily narrow it down so much in what we have there.  Okay.

19:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what are the things that we need to do to make these guys convert?

19:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but I think controls is one and then the third party management is one and I think those two.  I'm not sure about risk assessment, but it's getting so much more play in the market like that's a question mark but I feel like we'll lose a lot if we don't do that because that's the one thing the regulation requires.  So develop controls, third party management and risk assessment.

20:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All of these are certain things.

20:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah I'm fairly certain I'm having worked in this sector like you can't otherwise we end up not addressing what we're saying we're addressing.

20:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So most of these things are related to how much risk assessment to be yellow like I think what we need to talk to people about risk assessment that could be yellow but I have a feeling that that's what they're gonna want to expect something on that line because a lot of them have talked about it.  And there's always different ways of asking things that will bring people to considering the specific rate, right? If we asked them, hey, would you like to have integrated risk assessment?  They'll say, yes. How much would you pay for integrated risk assessment?

21:08 - Mau
  Oh, yeah, I wouldn't pay.

21:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That means no, right? So it's really important that we collect feedback that we do it in a way that, you know, they give us answers, they'll stand by later on with their credit cards.  Yeah, and I think that's all, you know, I just set up a lot of meetings for next.

21:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I set up a lot of meetings for in two weeks. and I've been inviting you guys to that meeting.  And the purpose of that is also to be like, is this good enough, right? Like, are you willing to convert?  Like, you know, is this enough for you to convert? What else would you want to see to be able to convert?  Like a lot of those questions, like a lot of opportunity also for you to join and like kind of poke at them to see what else.  Cause I do think some like would stop at like content policies and procedures, right? And it's like, are those the ICP that we want or like, but I do think other ones will there.  But if we suddenly go to our investors and we're like, oh, we decide. to drop 10 of them because two of them only want this, like it's not, it's not going to look interesting.

22:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure, for sure. I understand that. I understand that mechanic of not surprising investors by saying, oh, we just changed the plan midway.  Of course, that's not what we're suggesting here. I think the underlying idea here is, okay, let's focus on converting these guys.  But also, try to find things that we can do that require the least development time. Because not just for the costs, but also for the complexity of the product.  I'm going to give an example. Let's say that what they really, really want for converting is that they need, they want like a two hour course at the start, right?  Live course. And you say, you know what, this is a lot of work. doing things that don't scale. But if I do this, I don't need to introduce more complexity in the platform at this stage.  And it could be a thing that converts them, even though it doesn't mean that the platform becomes more complex, you know, for the first, for the beginning stage.  And I think the more we think in those terms of what can we do to convert people that does not mean increasing the complexity of the platform, I think it helps us because the platform will get complex no matter what is how software works.  There's a sentence I really like which is software development is managing entropy is all about that. And I think it makes a lot of sense.  Because it's relatively easy to get people to code things. It's much harder and subtle to avoid them coding more things that we need to manage and maintain afterwards.  I get it. I get it.

23:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I guess I guess I want you guys to realize that like, I've already dumbed down my profession into like a really minor  minor.

24:00 - Mau
  There's so much in here that we haven't even covered.

24:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like, I get a little bit empty when you're like, oh, do we need to do this?

24:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we need to do this?

24:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I've already cut down 20 years of like something like into like these, like, I'm not even talking about sanctions.  I'm not talking about all these other things that we could be doing in this realm, right? I'm like kind of trying to bring it down to what I think is actually the minimum that we need to be able to convert for these customers.  so, yes, we can like, so I think that's, I just want you to recognize that like what we're doing already is already a lot of simplification.  I just hesitate of like simplifying it even more and be like, okay, now let's only be a content management thing.  Like, so, but yes, of course, we can simplify things.

24:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And that's how we're doing like the third party management process that we've been discussing.

24:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like, there are tools that I paid 80,000 euro just for 30 part third party management, right? so the process that we're doing on third party management, is a super light process that's already outside of the thing.  So it's like or to be like, oh, do we really need third-party management? I'm like, yes, we do, but we just do the live version.  that's where I'm kind of like, I do think these are like the basic things that we need, like in a compliance program or an ESG program there, you know?  So that's what I'm trying to get at. But I do agree that we can simplify and, yeah. Do that.

25:22 - Mau
  Yeah, it's good to have a vision about that because sometimes, you know, as non-specialists, you get that, we need to improve quite a lot all the time, but it's already there.  So yeah, thank you for that. Thank you for reminding us that, you know, the process is already done in a simple way.

25:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and I think this is a challenge and I was trying to explain it to like a person who's like, our investor who's like, I'm like, I think some people will be overwhelmed by, you know, the 24 policies that we have suddenly in there, right?

25:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In our school.

25:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And this is where I was like, I think we can probably onboard a little bit better and not scare them.  But like, We are already saving a lot of time by having those 24 policies already provided because it wasn't for us already providing that it would be each person googling each policy trying to create one person got it by and check in 24 times, which will take at least six months to do right.  So it might seem overwhelming that we're doing a lot and can we cut out some of these words like we are already stringlining and we can optimize obviously more and everything too.  But like we already a lot of this is meant to streamline it. So I feel like we are already like cutting out a lot like what is the minimum and what is the minimum control we can get away with that we can sell this product right with a minimum third party management we can get away with to sell our product.  It's not like whether or not we need third party management. It's like which of the sections can we get in like at the cheapest like the smallest possible way to get away with it.  That's kind of that. Yeah, that's great.

26:59 - Mau
  That's a really useful. And what's the minimum we can get away with?

27:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's exactly in the direction we could go, because we deliver the value. yeah, and that's what like, know, and I think that's what we're trying to do, right?

27:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And everything that, yeah. Yes, yes. And I think that's also an interesting question for the pilots, right?

27:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's the minimum thing you need for controls? What's the minimum thing you need for third-party management? Like what's your, the bronze option for controls, the silver option for controls, and the gold option for controls, right?  This is something we could collect from the pilots, right?

27:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You can and you cannot, because controls, not every, like controls I think is our secret sauce, because not everybody is doing it.  So it's like, they have to look at it to see and they're like, oh yeah. This is good and this is easy and I can implement it right away.  If you were to come up with somebody being like controls, you know, what is it like they're not going to be able to tell you what good control is.  Right? Like maybe for third party management, like you could talk to awkward, you know, you could talk like Anya had a conversation, like she could tell you what her basic third party is.

28:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But if you were to ask Zanetta, who has no idea of this process, they're not going to know what is the minimum third party process that they can live with.

28:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Right?

28:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like Anya and Linda from Hydro Rain could probably tell you what minimum third party that they need with it.

28:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think they have said it as part of their design of it, but for controls, it will be more difficult.

28:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And risk management, we're probably going to have to do the same thing, right?

28:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So, yeah.

28:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that's a useful data point, right? Like what you just said, models are a secret sauce. I think that's a really powerful thing that it shapes the way we talk about the project.  Because like, let's give a silly example, right? controls, having all controls in one place, being easy to manage controls, that's really useful, right?  And let's imagine that for companies that have really mature and senior and experienced compliance officers and so on, that they get what the word controls means, right?  They look for it and they find it and oh yes, they have the thing I need, right? But Xenota and companies like Xenota, they don't know that they don't know of the concept of controls, right?  They don't know they need it. If you ask them people, they ask you for faster horse is the whole thing, right?  So they don't know they need it and it's kind of a magical moment, a wild moment. my god, 45 just made this so easy to track, right?  So if controls are this essential to the platform, and I can see what you're saying, it's interesting to think like, oh, can we make the value of controls of the control?

30:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  section really easy to grasp for people that don't even thinking in terms of the word controls like can we can we give like center stage to this feature without changing the structure just the way we sell it you know like I think there's there's interesting stuff that we could do there uh that might like the around the controls yes yeah that's like the whole point about the integrity hub right and integrity hub brags about not only the policies of what they're doing but the controls that they're actually doing that not everybody is actually doing like right like it's so easy to make a policy procedure and training out there you can do that with chapter bt right but where a lot of people go wrong is that they don't have any way of actually executing on it right so it's like I care about the environment we have a really great environmental policy but we're not even checking our digital carbon output right like you just say whatever you want in the environment  You know, if you have no action, which is the controls, the controls of the action of what you're doing to actually manage it, then you're kind of greenwashing, right?  So that's where I think, and there's so many companies that are doing that right now. So we're able to help them actually not greenwashing, actually do something, actually, you know, check their carbon thing, check their scope one and two, then they're actually doing something.  They're not greenwashing. They can brag about it externally.

31:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's why I think it's our secret sauce. Okay.

31:32 - Mau
  Yeah, that's, you know, I have, I just grabbed a here. We have thousands of very good selling agreements. So when you say that, I feel like we are really on the right path, you know, as you said before, we have 26 policies to check that would take six months to.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to go there so you can avoid also implementing a culture about not getting to greenwashing and everything.

32:10 - Mau
  So I'm just in my head as a business designer, I'm always, you know, reminding that we have a lot to brag about.  it's good.

32:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good setting points.

32:22 - Mau
  Yeah.

32:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And that's part of the feedback form that we've asked from the pilots is, you know, like how much time do you think you've saved if you were to do this on your own?  And that's also like, hopefully they'll all come back and then we can go out like, Hey, we've launched our product and our customers on an average, they've saved 10 hours just on this section of the thing.  Yeah. Like there's a lot of bragging things that can come from that process. Great.

32:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I'm thinking of, does this reflect kind of the model of business?

33:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, that's a very good synthesizer. Sorry, this thing broke.

33:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I need to pause this.

33:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, but I think that's like a great way of, this is like, I feel like you have such a super power ish out in terms of like, yeah, just like That is what we've been trying to do.  It's like teach you what to do. So then then do it for you and then you can brag about it with integrity hub and get a certification.  So that is like, yeah, you just set it in a much simpler and eloquent way. Thank you.

33:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think if we communicate so there's there's the way I see it that we have a couple of different levers to get people's credit cards right.  And one of them is purely on the product side, which is like just make the product they want to make.  And there's also this kind of the short theory of 45, this is our attempt at that, right? And if we get both of them, people get even more flexible and they are willing to deal with a platform that is still growing and being developed.  So I think we need like these two parts of the creation. So now what to do, the regulation. Okay, so this is just, I think this is kind of a slide somewhere.  I don't know where it is, but... I feel like I should add that on a pitch deck.

34:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, that's a thing.

34:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it relates to... the jobs to be done, right? It relates to what the people that will use the software they need to get done in daily lives.  I think that's the more we can make it look like this solves a problem I already have. I think the easier it is for people to decide to do it, right?  So, yeah, anyway, I believe we get it. So, let's get back to this. So, controls are our secret source because they allow for that thing.  What else? touch on the pilots. now, how do we have a strategy for staying in touch with pilots and managing the feedback and the learnings we get from them?

35:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Brian and I just created this survey. We could probably put the link in so you can see where we're just kind of giving feedback.  But I did invite you to all of those calls on the week of 24th. And that's also an opportunity to get the feedback.  could we gather? information more consistently, probably. But maybe Brighton, can throw in the chat, like in the survey that we sent out along with the access code to it.  And it goes through each of the sections of policies, procedures, trainings, like what did you like, what was easy, but nothing like overall around the product in the direction.

36:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's been hard to do that before because we haven't made it to show them any things.

36:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's quite exciting that they click around and understand what it means. yeah.

36:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. I'm thinking, like, so we have several sources of information, right? Some are pilots, some are... And all of these things, they should go somewhere.  And from then we make decisions. So I don't know what this is. Maybe this is... The name escapes me, I'll just call it a folder is not a folder, but let's think of it as a folder.  And we have a folder and then we make decisions. We'll make product decisions. Sorry, this is not product decisions, right?  And so we have a survey, right? We have the calls. We have your social media expertise. And do we have other sources?

37:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, we have, like, we will eventually, as we get farther at auditing partner because we need to bring our auditing partners in to review our platform to make sure that it would pass the audit.

38:09 - Mau
  Okay.

38:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And okay, so can I share my screen with you for a second? I mean, I am sharing my screen.  sorry. I want to share something on my computer. That is a little bit different. So just a second. Okay.  Okay. Okay. So I'll share a different part of my screen. what I'll show, the thing about what I'll show is not the tool I'm using.  It's just the thinking of it that I think it's useful. So share. I want to share the entire screen.  Yeah, share the entire screen. Now we're seeing like the infinite mirror thing. Okay. So what you see now is some notes I've made.  These are in Portuguese of interview that I run with this person, right? And I was interviewing this person not to sell or anything, but just to learn more about the situation, which is very much like what's happening with the pilots, right?  So I had the script and then I wrote things about any time she mentioned like something that was difficult, I put a hashtag, a marker, say customer page, right?  So I would put all these tags along the document, right? And then whenever I interview several people, I use the same tags, right?  So if I click on this tag, I see every time that I use this tag here on the left side, right?  And then I did a collected the customer page and I put them here. This was manual, okay? And just the idea that as I'm talking to people, I should put everything that I learned from them in the same place, it's really good, right?  So if we have the survey, if we have the interviews, if we have the audit experts, if we have all these different sources of information, it's useful that we find some way, you know I love tables, we find some way that we just put them in the same place, right?  Just at least make them accessible in the same place. Because then making those product decisions becomes much easier, right?  This is a complex system, but the basic idea is I find a way of connecting the insights out to a core spot where I concentrate all of the insights, right?  And it could be Miro, it could be Figma, it could be other things. Does this make sense?

40:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think it is. Yeah, it is. We have like information, eggs did some customer interviews in the beginning, they put it into that Miro that I think you had access to.  We just had you know recordings of the conversations that we've had and then recorded on teams somewhere. We haven't had like a central organization of where like this is where everything...  should be so I definitely agree like now we have the survey thing that probably to put in the chat that we're like collecting information that we can always move to somewhere else once we have the export information so I think it's a yeah we should do so I think at least like the closest probably that what we have is from eggs design they did the first customer like inquiry like in the beginning when we first started the process I don't know where that is it's on a mural somewhere but I do think we have an opportunity also because we are going through this so we have five nhh interns which is top finance school in Norway and they have they're going to be working with us part-time doing kind of I would say prospecting to CFOs most who have graduated from their finance school to try and find out a little bit more like you know do like a market survey like so that we can use for marketing later on saying like we interviewed 100 you know CFOs in the Nordics and this is what they say about ESG but as part of that process we're kind of purposely using it as a way to narrow down you know are they actually ready you know like  idea like yeah and then and then try to sell them or try to bring them into the pilot but then we could also use that thing to be like what are your biggest pain points you know and start collecting some information that you guys might actually find helpful in your design too we could have them ask a few additional questions and then and then but a lot of it is meant to like try to see like you know if they go like we have this money budget and we want to implement it in next you know three months they'd be like oh do you want to you know fortify and then like and do it that way that's like about to start like they're just in the research but they're probably within a week or two they're gonna start calling and that so it could be good that we use this to answer any questions and like add in a few questions from you guys to make sure that he they get the pain points that you would like um so yeah this is more if you have any ideas of they should have to make the thing the most the most useful and that would be good too

43:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Perfect. I think you've touched on a very good thing, which is we have several motions going on to learn more about our customers, and we now will have a team that can help us put these things in a place.  the same place, it could be the Miro, could be all in the same spot, and everybody can access it and check it, right?  Because then we can trace product decisions to specific insights, right? I think that would be really useful. I don't know, a quick question.

43:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Right, and if you're looking at Apollo to be able to track the people that we reach out, is there a way in Apollo to gather the notes and tag the notes so that we're  you wouldn't pull information like within their CRM or something like that. Well, you can check it's not, you don't have answer that right now, but that's something that we can check to in terms of collecting the information.

44:11 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan (fortifai.co)
  By gathering notes, you mean putting in information that we get from the customers into Apollo?

44:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  One is like we have an Apollo, it's like a CRM system with lists all the names like Bright, Zhao, Mal.

44:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So once you and then you have the contact information and then you know, like we've interviewed them, we've tried calling them once we've reached them.

44:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then once you get to the point where they're at the interview, is there a place for notes where you can be like, I interviewed Mal and he's with these 10 questions and here's the answer.

44:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we put it into his file, right?

44:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So that, you know, within Mal, you know, so then later on, if we like have another conversation with Mal, we'll know what he said in that and we can figure out what his pain points are.  And there's any way to like export that so that we see everybody's pain points. I don't know, I feel like there should be some system that does that.  I'll try to get that point if you can look at that.

44:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, thank you. Okay, if you believe that this is worth to do, we can set up a customer insights board that everyone can use, and we can just put things there, all sorts of things, like it's very flexible.  And then we could just trade it, we could do this, like imagine we have a mirror, and the mirror has a little space for the link, right, for the source.  The person that processes the source, let's say, is some intern called, I don't know, Thor, maybe I'm being, and he makes notes from this, from the source, right.  And then Brighton also has her own notes, on another source, maybe the survey, right, and we have a bunch of insights.  right and then we bring these insights into clusters and then these clusters they give us sorry possible possible directions right so for instance oh we want super AI policy I don't know okay this is an hypothesis or they want third party light okay this is another hypothesis based on the things that we've learned from all these different sources right and then and you've seen this because this is what x did then we realized effort impact and we bring these things oh this is here but this is here so we'll do this third party light and then we get go for this  decisions, or product decisions, product decision, and we say, let's come on pen. Yeah, my bet is let's make third party light.  Okay. And then we develop. I know this feels like a lot of work, but it could be fast because you can now do it running the parallel because you have several interns.

47:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, think like, I'm only hesitating as kids, CFOs aren't going to know anything about their party immigration or like AI policy or like, like, they're not going to know.  They would just know that they have a job that like from CFOs, we need to understand like what like, I think it's for this thing is like more like selling point, you know, like what part of our tool can we emphasize and sell more to the CFOs?  what was based on what we find, right? What are the pain points that they keep talking about? they're not gonna, like third, CFOs aren't gonna understand third party management or mismanagement or like controls.  Like they're not gonna, there's like, I need to get this ESG done and I have a budget for it and I want to get it done.  So like asking them like more, like should we build this or is this what you need? And the tool is not necessarily, I don't think you'll get that at the CFOs.  They're not subject matter experts there. So it's more like, I think it's more like, you know, does speed matter or are you happy?  if it's like, you know, fast, is it like, you know, do you want like, you know, doesn't matter if it's nine to 12 weeks or would you be happy?  know, is six weeks gonna help you? don't know. Or is it like six months or maybe speed doesn't make a difference.  Like, you know, like, I don't like, do you need another resource or would you rather not hire a resource to use this?  I don't know. There's other, I think there's other question but I worry about like, if we're trying to get at what question is needed, then it's more, it's probably better to go through our pilots.  Like there are more, like half of them are subject matter experts and then half of them are not. go go see it.  Those are not, like with that, how many CFOs do we have?

49:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Abby, I think we're discussing the different things here. I use the example of the interns because I know they can run all the interns on the CFOs and that's at a source of insight.  But we have several sources of insight, right? We have CFOs, we have the calls with pilots, we have the audit partner, we have the surveys and all of these things will come into a box like this.

49:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I agree.

49:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Some sources, they tell us more about product decisions. Some other sources, maybe the CFOs, they tell us more about messaging decisions.  Like, how do we talk about 45 in a way that CFOs are interested in it? And those are even better because those don't need development time, right?  Those are just about the way we explain our product. And so the basic idea here is I didn't want to leave these two abstracts.  So I used, like, a concrete example. But the example would never fit every situation. But the basic idea is that we have a centralized...  a source of truth, a single source of truth, and we have a disciplined way to make decisions. Discipline is perhaps too strong a word, but maybe structured.  And then we have decisions that answer customer concerns, right? Because these decisions could be on many different things, right?  But the basic idea here is that if we are making all these efforts to collect information, these efforts are also stressful, right?  Because every time we talk to a client, and I think you've mentioned this before, a client or a potential client, and they tell us what the

51:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  what they want but if we don't really if we if we miss things or if the conversion rate from like they give us 50 pieces of insight and we implement one and then you show it to them and say I told you guys so much things and you just put this button here right so the less leaks we have in this process from insight to decision the more I agree it like so I like don't disagree I think the the reason why we haven't done that is just because we're running around with our heads cut chickens with our heads cut off so there's somebody who has to organize that or maybe Brighton can help like make sure we have a place in that center because we do have all those kind of like our designs you know they're all over the place just because we've like been running so fast that like I do think I agree like I think that we should look back more at the that the interviews that that eggs has done you know and kind of review like we actually achieved some of the things that they said right  I don't think we look at those enough, too. So maybe we should bring those back into the forefront and say how we, because one of them did ask these questions.  Maybe we should maybe take that exercise now and just look at it. Because I also feel bad, we constantly ask new questions, that we ask the same questions to people that we've already asked it.  But maybe it was really asking once. And then might be Yvonne asking the second time. And then it might be you asking it the third time.  And it's all the same type of questions that you guys are asking, but you weren't available in the different calls when that was first sent.

52:34 - Mau
  So we are kind of missing this information.

52:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think it's worthwhile to look back where it is. And I don't even know. Do you know where really stuff is, if I chance to show you?

52:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I have access to that mirror. And there's stuff there, but I don't think I have all the things.  But I mean, I'm not. I understand why we didn't have time to do this yet, and I think that that's fine.  I totally agree with you, and I think it's good that you bring it in, that let's just execute on it then, and let's say, how do we do this then?

53:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  is, do we give all the interns access to a Miro board? Do we have one note? you've probably done this more at larger scale, what is the best way to do this, right?

53:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

53:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we can prototype it.

53:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's prototype it right now. So we have, so this is an ugly thing, right? Source of info, and we have place here the link to source.  This thing is yellow, this thing is locked, right? And we have a bunch of things, like this, sorry, and what have we learned from this?  Okay, and we have this, and we have this many times. Just copy this many times. Okay, so this one is for survey.  This is just an example, right? I'll put a fake one here. Survey from Zenitha, okay? And then we have the survey from whatever.  We just export the results from the survey, And then we have learned that, they want speed and they want  But then we have a third guy that says they want speed, and then we know, okay, so speed is more important.  So this is a silly example, right? So as we do, as we fill this in, and this will be a lot of different things, a lot of you know, a lot of sources for this.  And then we see these patterns. And then I think is that for the analysis bit, we can do it together.  But we can analysis, I wrote everything wrong, but you get my point. And we realize that, yeah, people want speed.  This is a example, I understand that. It's just, okay, how can we, how can we decision, how can we decide on people want speed, and people want rigor, less so, okay?  Let's imagine that here on the analysis, there's like 50 things people want, right? Everything depends on the source of information.  And then on the decision, we have the classic 2 by 2. It's not the only way of prioritizing things, but this is a good enough way.  And then we realize, oh, not a lot of impact and a lot of effort in this thing. So now, we make a prioritization.  This is what we know people want, and then we ask ourselves, how do we make it faster? And we realize, oh, maybe the way to make it faster is just to add.

57:00 - Mau
  AI, I don't know, just still an example, right?

57:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you say, OK, let's add AI. Because what's very, very, very common, not just on Fortify, like everywhere, is that we tend to be anxious, we have our own ideas on how things could work, and we tend to jump into this bit.  Almost everyone does this. Everyone, I mean, even people that are aware of the process do this, it's very, very common.  And what happens is that this is based on a model of reality that could be wrong. Maybe we think that these people think in a certain way that they think in a different way.  And this is especially true if we are serving a market that is not exactly us, right? So in the terms of the compliance, correct me, please, if I'm wrong.  I think you're super familiar with the way large companies do it. but perhaps more companies, have a feeling, a good feeling, an informed feeling.  But there's some nuance that is less familiar to you. That would be normal. So basically, this feels like a waste of time if we are thinking, oh, I want to develop things.  I want to develop things. I want to develop things. But the problem is that, and I know you've seen this in other places, when we jump into developing things, and if you're developing the wrong thing or if you're developing the thing wrong, we are wasting the time regardless.  And we'll need to go back here to figure out what people actually want.

58:26 - Mau
  So this is not an abstraction.

58:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is actually how I would make the mirror. I would make it prettier and more organized. But I would create a mirror like this, a big one, give access to everyone at 45.  And we just have a routine of every time we collect information, we drop it here, we analyze it, we extract the insights, we bring it into the analysis, and then we make decisions.  And I can make this prettier and just give access to everyone. And we can start doing that.

59:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is this something that would be useful for you?

59:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think so.

59:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  think so.

59:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can also work on this.

59:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think maybe we can also find the original mural, maybe Brighton. can help also grab the stuff from the original mural and stick it in here.  And that's also a good way for you to be updated Brighton on what was done before, too. Because we have a previous UX UI designer group that did ask some questions.

59:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And yeah, maybe tell you can send the mural to in this chat and maybe Brighton can have access to it.

59:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  then we can see, yeah, where it is.

59:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't know. I think you're still seeing my screen, right?

59:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

59:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is one.

59:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I go to the right. That may be it. Can you go to the left maybe, oh wait, the right, there it is, to the left, no, go to the left, yeah, go in there and then go down to that area where you are right now.  Yeah, go down there. There, yeah, no, to the right, sorry, scorecard, yeah, go to the right scorecard, that's where I think.  Yes, that's it.

1:00:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Brighton, is like every column is a person that was interviewed and here are the questions and some of their answers and positive, neutral, big fail, right?  So for Anya, she likes the categories on the right. I don't remember the date when this was done. But this is talking about the compliance map.

1:01:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So she was asking, yeah, like, I like, what do you think about the compliance map? Was it helpful and helpful?  And then, yeah. And then the overview section and then question. Yeah.

1:01:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we so long story short, we already have some content to bring in that into that format. Right. And just to like, what obstacles are you from adopting it?

1:01:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You know, which possibly not all of these were answered. think we ran out of time is my guess on some of this.

1:01:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, yeah.

1:01:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then, yeah, like Ania said, I wish I had the system. that's what we're positive. Yeah.

1:01:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if I ever sent you this, but there's also customer interview. Yeah. So I've made some notes for myself on how to run customer discovery interviews.  And they can send you this.

1:02:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's really great, also for the interns who are trying to do that. Yeah. So let me bring this.

1:02:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where are we? OK, so a couple of things we've learned so far. We need to focus on converting the pilots that we knew.  And the way to convert the pilots is to give them what they want that we knew. We have some assumptions on what they want.  We have kind of a narrative to explain a little bit. it's how Fortify works. also have an understanding of how to collect different sources of insights to later make decisions on it.  There's still some things I think we didn't touch on, which is the pricing, but I understand that pricing you guys will run research on it.  And I think there's also a podcast episode really good on this. Okay. Maybe you'll know this guy.

1:03:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. In terms of like immediate help, we are about, I think probably not, we have two weeks and then we're going to send five interns to contact the 100 CFOs around the Nordics, like with certain types of questions.  I would love to get some, and it's a 20 minute interview. think that's probably the only time they can be able to get it.  So what are the top 10 questions that's going to help move forward? buy forward, you know, both in terms of like either sales, which is very important because we need to like sales or like any part of our business design or, know, like something like, you know, like, I don't want to just ask chat to PT and like ask some questions.  Like, can we be a little bit thoughtful about like what is going to make the most of these 20 minutes that's going to help us make design the best product, know, sell the best product, do the different things.  think that's, you know, what I would need to know.

1:04:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you like per-classy more than chat to PT? Yes.

1:04:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes. I also got it.

1:04:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I got the pro version because I had some benefit from my phone line that I got a year a year free, but it runs on check on the same model of chat to PT.

1:04:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  it doesn't make a lot of difference.

1:04:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is my model for making the most out of interviews. Information that we can get elsewhere. don't ask on the interview we use that information to prove the guys on the interview that we mean business and we make really smart questions right because then they they they stay open to participate in other questions and other interviews later on if they don't feel that we are you know movies or amateurs so what I would do and and I've done this for my business as well is like I described the situation and we interviewing chief financial officers and not sustainability or compliance officers come again sorry Bryton why are we interviewing CFOs and not like chief sustainability officers or chief compliance officers because CFOs at the end of the day for smaller companies smaller medium-sized companies don't tend to have sustainability or compliance officers so the CFO would be the the person that owns that topic in there in the

1:06:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  world if you don't have a sustainability compliance officer and the CFO is most likely the person that's the budget owner and there's a one who's going to approve whether or not this goes on.

1:06:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right so I'm not asking what questions I should ask I'm asking to find find me reports right and maybe ESG software versus compliance because compliance could be yeah yeah accounting accounting compliance for sure for sure but just to see is thinking and while it's thinking we can do something else but so basically my model for this is make the most out of them which means uh do do research on the main areas of concern okay what we don't know then no we add  OK, and we don't have time to ask for everything. So we need to prioritize. How do we, what's the most, what's the one thing we want to learn from the CFOs?  They're not a prior tool.

1:07:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  What would make them buy the tool, right? Something like that?

1:07:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think so.

1:07:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, what would make them buy the tool? Or what, yeah, what are they like? What are, it's almost like, it's like a pre-sales thing.  Like, what are their pain points that if you like, you say it, that, you know, then when you have the actual call with them, you'd be like, let me, you know, what are the, what do they keep saying that their point points are, that then you can have them ready when you are actually selling it to them.  Being like, yeah, I understand CFOs have these main pain points and this is how we address them, you know, like, so we understand that, like talking in there.

1:08:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  their way, guess. And then like how much budget are they even thinking about ESG, right?

1:08:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  given Trump and him coming in and like kind of destroying like anything good, like have they put it lower on their point point?  this is like, you know, not an urgent thing anymore. Are they looking to implement ESG in the next three to six months?  And then how and then if so, how much are they waiting to pay for it?

1:08:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is a good, this is a really good direction because surely the way they think about this has changed.  It's impossible that it hasn't. So in which way it hasn't changed, right? Do they feel they need to be sneaky about it?  Do they feel they need to, they can just drop it? Do they feel that they need to focus on other things?  they're, they're thinking has changed. So the rules are different now. We should try to figure out what are the new rules, right?  Yes, yes, yes.

1:08:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think that would be really interesting marketing piece later on in the interview. After Trump came and destroyed the

1:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Morality, what do they think about it now or something like that? So let's see if we got some answers.  So these are still kind of vanilla things. I don't know if JetGPT does this, but perplexity shows the sources for each thing.

1:09:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, that is not, yeah.

1:09:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I really like that. Even the normal one, not the pro one, does this. So the heavily total cost of ownership, risk mitigation.  Okay, this is kind of normal things. And so we're not getting the actual answer for this question here. I'm just kind of showing you things that we can do to make it quicker and better.  What are the most basic So, like, for instance, one of the things that you've mentioned a few times, I think it was reporting, right?  And I've read other, because my wife works at compliance, I've read other reports that people are starting to demand more granularity on data, like, did you train how many people, what was the impact of that, did that change any KPIs?  So, first thing, data quality and availability. So we can connect Fortify's proposition with this, right? By having a single software, we have the data all in one place.  What kind of data would you like to see? could be interesting. Navigating, navigating the complexity. Oh, there's so many things to do.  We can help you, you know, have everything in one place. Integration with financial reporting, this would be technically a little bit more complex, but still.  Anyway. So, I think running this sort of research before the interviews allow us to arrive at the interviews with like a draft, a mental model of how that person thinks.  And then we can have a more informed discussion. And then we can have like, sometimes one, you just need like one good question and people talk so much about it and that you get really valuable insight.  So, anyway, would making this a little bit more structured help you? Yeah, absolutely.

1:11:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  feel like especially, you know, we have these interns that are coming to Oslo next Friday. I think most next Friday, like we're probably talking about, yeah, the strategy on how to, they've never called CFOs, right?

1:11:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, like the more structured that we have it, like very clear on what they ask and how they ask and how they collect the information, put it, how do you gather that, like the better result we'll get for what we need to do, right?

1:12:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So if we can get a good system around that, that would be really helpful.

1:12:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah, and then like what like, you know, what, yeah, why are we doing this and how are we doing this?

1:12:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think like we haven't, like, yeah, I haven't been strategic enough to think about this kind of and running around doing all these different things.  And I just set it in motion, right? So it's like either it's gonna, it's gonna go no matter what, but it could be optimized to be even better, or it could be like a half  survey, or but if we really think strategically about this and get the right questions in, whatever it could be an awesome survey, right?

1:12:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and really help us towards our business. so that's where I'm like, I think you have a lot more experience doing these kind of things, because I haven't really done that many.

1:12:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And to understand like, yeah, if they have 20 minutes with a CFO from their alumni, who's more likely to answer the phone and give them a time, because it's students asking these questions, what would be helpful?  this is yeah, like, what could be good around on around this?

1:12:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I don't know if there's anything like

1:13:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like now on your design time side, you know, what questions are you asking that you're curious that the CF also know that would help, you know, in the design of the tool, we can try to ask a few questions around that.  But I think for me, and the reason for doing this is more that we have to sell us. We have to have a certain pipeline and certain revenue coming in before we can go to sea.  So this, the whole point was kind of to, to try to customers through this process in kind of a Trojan horse style of like, here's a marketing survey.  can get some sales and we're asking a general survey question, but at the same time to qualify leads.

1:13:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that would eventually qualify them and then be able to target them later on. Yes. So, for instance, it's very easy to go fractal on this and go like 30 levels of depth.  But one of the things like, ideally, and it's very difficult to do. It's very easy to think about this, but it's difficult to do it like in our daily lives.  But we could imagine. scenario where if we collect information from these CFOs, if we collect it well, we can set up timers and scheduling things for ourselves and like in three months, we send an email to this guy and say, hey, we spoke about this thing and at the time you showed an interest in this aspect.  We just very happy to show you that we developed a new feature. You want to see it?

1:14:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Something like this, you know?

1:14:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And keep doing this. Yeah, exactly.

1:14:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And that's why I feel like some of these processes, sometimes we're not optimizing it because either I don't have the experience or I don't have the time to think about it.

1:14:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I I don't know about it, but that's totally a good point.

1:14:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How do we collect the information from the interns so that at the end of the conversation, say, hey, can we keep you on the email list so that we can keep you updated or something like that.

1:14:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then they have their email and then three months, you reach out to them again, so now we've launched or now we have this and something like that.

1:14:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  yeah, this is all like would be great to Okay, let's do it.

1:15:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll put something together and this is the way to discuss it too. For sure, we can for sure. My suggestion would be I would put something together with like a couple of materials and set up this framework for collecting the insight and based on that, then we can have like I can record a call where I explained it.  And you can show it to the interns because this might be difficult to set up the right times. Just keep it recorded.  And then we set them loose and we should probably also have some conversations after the interviews. For We should have conversations after the interviews for analyzing them together.  Because for us, we could just ask you know chat gpt to go as the insight but that's that's a waste of it's not the best way of doing it I think so one of the ways people run interviews is that you have the you have the recruitment phase and you have the interface phase and then you keep making sure the things are happening so I'm very happy to say that there will be a spreadsheet for this and okay sure I we can do that but I don't know if there's a time like one we should set up we I realize we don't have any time set up for next week so we could discuss that to put something in the calendar maybe like yeah Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon I don't know Thursday afternoon is the best for me  Well, what's your time? CET, above Lisbon, I don't know, I don't know, okay, so now we have CET here in Brazil Thursday afternoon is the widest for me, Tuesday morning is also So Friday is difficult because the interns are actually in town on Friday but they might be in town Thursday afternoon, I don't know if they will be in town by then So, okay, let's discuss the purpose of that conversation is to get the interns up to speed But I was just thinking if I think it loud because it's so it's the first time Brighton and I will be

1:18:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  in terms that are coming to also, they live in Bergen, the city where the finance school is. But in the meantime, right now, what we've been talking to them is they've been doing like the scouring of the companies, you know, how many companies have revenue over this, who is the right contact point, like they're doing like a lot of that background stuff over the last two weeks.  So then the question is like, it would be good to, you know, once they have that, which is like the next last two weeks, you're using that information to check how things are going.  And then we have a meeting on Friday where they're in town for a whole day. So part of that, was I going to probably bring in a sales consultant to talk about, okay, if we were to say, what is our goal by June?  know, what do we need to bring in? Like, how many interviews do we need to learn? we have to try to do some kind of analysis of what our pipeline needs to be.  And like, and this is how this would fit into the pipeline. I do think like, but I think we could also be, we don't have to do it on Friday, if you can't do it, it's just that they're all in town, you know, but then my one is like,  And we had this more done is like what are we asking you know how do you ask and like all of these different things and how do you how do we make sure that they put their notes in the same place and all of these different things because they're starting to create their own notion thing to be able to create like capture all of their information so it's like we should just be aligned on that.  So that was just more what I'm thinking. Another option might be really Thursday afternoon because we have this drinks thing on Thursday.  I don't know how many of us will be in town but maybe we could do a drinks thing at 3pm or something like that.  Yeah, or we can also like I think we can also do it after like next the week after two it's fine you know like I think we do it before they start calling but we didn't want them to start calling sooner rather than later.

1:19:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so they will have if I'm so right now they are prepping right. They're prepping and then prep research and then they'll have training and then they'll run interviews and then we analyze, right?  So this is happening ongoing, right? This is ongoing right now, right? This is to do, this is do, do and this is to do.  So on the prepping they have a notion where they're putting research, right?

1:20:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know, they had just started setting it up and this is what we agree with Brighton is that we'd look whether or not Apollo would be a better  But because it's like, there's one is just for research, right? But one is as my CRM system, these are all the people that we contacted.  This is what they said at the time, you know, so that later on, if we want to go back and contact them, we've already had some feedback on it, right?  So it's like a CRM system that we're looking at.

1:21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so Bryton was looking at Apollo as a possibility.

1:21:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So but it could be like you put Apollo for your notes on here, and then you use this Miro to capture your notes.

1:21:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know, like, but we should have a process.

1:21:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then there's another thing of like, these are the questions that you should be asking to get the most out of it.  So that we're aligned that if our outcome, you know, would be to have a survey that answers these great questions in life, you know, then we should ask these questions so that we can do this.  And if our goal is to, you know, get sales, what do we think is the most important questions we need to ask for that?  Okay.

1:21:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I think we it's usual and okay to have like different objectives at the same time, but I think it's also  useful if we can give them very explicit rules for the main goal is this and this is and the secondary goal is this.  So if you just say try to do everything, people have different interpretations of that. If you say put 80% of your energy into selling, which to be honest, I don't think it's a good move because they're not good at selling their newbies and the CFOs.  There's like a huge symmetry in skill.

1:22:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The CFOs will see right through it.

1:22:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so I would say let's put 80% of it into collecting information because successful people like to help to be successful people, right?  They see themselves in the past and they like to give information, but they see right through them. So there's no point in getting these guys to try to sell stuff, I think.  And then we could put like 80% of the energy into building reports that we can use for later to sell, right?  But selling, I think it's impossible to happen by a bunch of

1:23:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If they can qualify them and then maybe throw out a pitch if they like a certain qualifications are met they can throw out something I don't know like otherwise they can just gather information and say we want to keep in touch with you and share the report in like three months with more information.  Yeah, that's a good point maybe that's a way but these are the things like yeah like I want like to put a thing strategically with an experienced person about these because I don't think about all of this and then I'm like okay yeah you guys go to sell and you're like hold on that's not gonna work so that's like getting this feedback is helpful.

1:23:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay yeah I think how are we for time?

1:23:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think I like find a way to go to the design sink so then I think we're good so we can stop here and take a break and then go to there but um but do we want to are you thinking like three o'clock on Thursday?  8 or like 2 o'clock on Thursday for just you and maybe Brighton catching up on like I was thinking is anything in controls or like third party that we need to we need to eat like yeah we need to get it ready or maybe even next like I think I think we'll have a little bit of a let's let's see how this next one goes I'm open to that you can see my I have time for that but let's see how this one goes so we schedule a call that there's a very specific agenda because otherwise we'll just open whoops and I think yeah but we still need to figure out we still need to figure out third like a controls or office and that right or is Romeo ready for that to start drawing it like I just some of the controls we don't have we need to get that that done asap because we need that like done like because the develop we have two weeks right so this is supposed to be like the first week like or half of the first week so technically they would  But we can discuss it tomorrow.

1:25:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm in the next meeting if you want to do because we have designed it here. I spoke to Romeo and there's stuff that was already done.  And so maybe this will be easier than than what it seems. So it's good. Let's talk about controls here in sync on sync.  Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you.

1:25:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Bye. Thank you.
