# Export Test Results (v3)

**Date:** 2024-03-20  
**Test File:** `test_export_v3.py`

## Overview

This document outlines the test results and format comparisons for the new participant structure in `export_v3.py`. The new structure removes the `participant_id` field while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

## Sample Outputs

### 1. Valid Participants (Multiple)
```yaml
---
title: Test Meeting
date: 2024-03-20T10:00:00Z
duration: 60m
participants:
  - name: John Doe
    is_host: true
  - name: Jane Smith
    is_host: false
source: Fathom
encoding: utf-8
scrapingdate: 2024-03-20T10:00:00+00:00
---
```

### 2. Single Host
```yaml
---
title: Solo Meeting
date: 2024-03-20T10:00:00Z
duration: 30m
participants:
  - name: John Doe
    is_host: true
source: Fathom
encoding: utf-8
scrapingdate: 2024-03-20T10:00:00+00:00
---
```

## Format Comparisons

### Old vs New Structure

**Old Structure (v2):**
```yaml
participants:
  - name: John Doe
    is_host: true
    participant_id: "12345"
```

**New Structure (v3):**
```yaml
participants:
  - name: John Doe
    is_host: true
```

### Key Changes
1. Removed `participant_id` field
2. Maintained `name` and `is_host` fields
3. Preserved YAML formatting and structure
4. Kept all other frontmatter fields unchanged

## Test Results

### 1. Valid Participant Structure
- ✅ Correctly formats multiple participants
- ✅ Properly identifies host/guest status
- ✅ Maintains YAML structure
- ✅ No `participant_id` field present

### 2. Single Host Case
- ✅ Correctly formats single participant
- ✅ Properly identifies host status
- ✅ Maintains YAML structure

### 3. Invalid Data Handling
- ✅ Empty names are rejected
- ✅ Missing required fields are rejected
- ✅ Invalid types (e.g., string for boolean) are rejected
- ✅ Invalid data results in empty participant list

### 4. Unexpected Fields
- ✅ Extra fields are removed from output
- ✅ Warning is logged for unexpected fields
- ✅ Core structure remains intact

## Compatibility Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - The new structure is compatible with systems that only use `name` and `is_host`
   - Systems requiring `participant_id` will need to be updated

2. **Forward Compatibility:**
   - The new structure is simpler and more maintainable
   - Future systems should use this structure as the base

3. **Migration Path:**
   - Systems can gradually migrate to the new structure
   - No immediate breaking changes required
   - `participant_id` can be generated elsewhere if needed

## Recommendations

1. Use `export_v3.py` for all new exports
2. Update documentation to reflect new structure
3. Plan migration for systems requiring `participant_id`
4. Monitor for any compatibility issues during transition

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production usage for any issues
2. Gather feedback from systems using the export
3. Plan any necessary updates to dependent systems
4. Consider adding more validation if needed
