0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  but this is not a competition so I'm just glad you are amazing. I'm good, I'm good, I'm amazing but I'm pretty good.

0:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How was the weekend? Amazing and I'm getting ready for Costa Rica. Do you get nervous before you travel? Always, know, and I was thinking, you know, is it normal to have fear and I always think about people that, you know, you're always going to have this sense of relationship with the unknown, with certain respect and intimidation, you know, and that doesn't mean that it's fear, it's something that you're opening yourself to out of your comfort zone, you know, but I'm doing a lot of trips, know, it's a geographical trip to Costa Rica and then the inner trip guiding people through the liminal space and then waiting for everything that be okay and then the post-integration so I have lots of responsibility.  during the retreat and as well that everything goes according to plan and knowing how to pivot or how to change something right away you know and I need to be on point so there's a lot of things going on my mind but I trust myself I always do my best and people love the experience but you know I cannot get away from the feeling of not knowing you know not knowing even though I can predict what might happen I can have like an intention and I believe that everything is going to be okay you're entering there unknown you know territories yeah I asked because every time I travel and I mean I just go home with my parents and not even like for such a high stakes thing helping others go through that I get a little bit anxious and just making sure I have everything lined up so my wife can tell right away she's like oh you're thinking about the trip next week I'm like yeah  And my father is the same, so that's why I asked.

2:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, but good, good. Everything will be fine as you well know, and let's make the most of it right now.  I'll send you the link for the video, okay? It's a different one. And there you go, there's this password.

2:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's a different one or a beautiful one? It's a, I think it's both.

2:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a different one, and I think it's beautiful. I like that. I don't know, I like this sort of aesthetic, so maybe it's not beautiful to you, but I like it.  Let's, how do you say, let's rate, and let's...

2:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm waiting to open. Password, 40, 40? Yes. Or just one 40? Two 40s.

2:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  40s.

2:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's not letting me, I have a chance. Okay. 40, 40.

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I see you, I see you, you've joined me, you show up, yes, yes, yes, so I'm bringing you to me and so just a very quick introduction so for today we'll go through this stuff and there's also we'll be using the Miro project management Gantt chart sort of thing that will be for the for the next session but you can see that this Miro I'm sending you will be like the home or for everything else and it could just use the same the same link for everything okay so yeah I see that you're following me so let's let's go for we have these two sessions planned right and the first one is about business goals and project boundaries so what do you want to do and what's within the realm of possibilities and what's outside right and for the second session we will use that information to break down the project in smaller parts  make some difficult choices on do we do this now do we do this later and so on right so for today can you share your screen so it can be recorded oh yeah you are absolutely right i thought i was that was not i thought it was going so well and then i forgot to share the screen anyway there you go there you go i don't even know you're explaining my mind it's looking at the cover conversations no problem no problem so so yeah so for today success will be these three things okay we'll have a business goal definition and maybe this is quite likely that's already in your head we'll just pull it out and make it very explicit we'll figure out the project boundaries what's possible what will not be possible for now and we'll also choose and develop some criteria that will help us develop and make two choices afterwards because we know ourselves we know that we will always feel like the  pool of the shiny thing. So this will help us. And since I'm talking about the shiny thing, everywhere you'll see these white parking lots.  That's where we'll leave like, oh, this is a great idea, but not for right now. We won't throw it away.  We'll just put it here. And later, you can export them in the best possible way. Is that good? That's good.

5:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK, perfect.

5:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we'll start with a simple exercise, OK? And in terms of the business goal for the six-week program, the way I look at it is that you have a product perspective in terms of what kind of thing you want to have on your product portfolio, how you want it to look like, and so on.  You have a branding perspective, which I don't think it's super relevant for everybody, but it seems that it's quite relevant to you and the way you act in the world.  I think this coherence is not just in terms of style but like message is really evident in our conversations and also I left for the end because maybe you want to look at it in a different way like the financial perspective I've included this here because I think it will help us figure out if we are designing something that can achieve this perspective or this business goal or not okay and so the exercise now is a format that we're quite familiar with which would be like I said a timer and together we think about what are the goals you have from a product perspective for this six-week program is that good okay let me bring up a timer I told you I'd be annoying with the timers this time right so I'll put a little song yes put some music so I can yeah  We'll do one by one, but some idea comes up, you just go to the next one and do it, okay?  So what are you trying to achieve with this project in terms of the product perspective? Let me make a big provocation here.  Can you add some ideas about how this thing fits with the rest of your offerings, the rest of the things you do?  I can create extra ones. Thanks Let's Thank you. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music

11:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's see cool so I

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Analyze this yet. We'll just move into the next one. Okay, perfect.

12:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'll just set another timer and a different song The branding perspective, what is it actually about? How I want them to perceive the brand?

12:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, this is, so I'll give an example of what I think it's one of your branding goals, right? From my point of view, it seems to me that one of your objectives with this six program for the brand of Jorge Elizondo is to have a flag  cheap product like something that people say that is the epitome like the perfect example of the way Jorge works.  That's what I think it is from here but I'm not sure if I understand you fully and I want to make sure that it's your perspective.  Stigning to your methodology. Got it. I'll turn of brand values from you they should experience. you You I you

15:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  of you I I You

17:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know I know it's fun I agree I know I know it's fun I agree you Got it. So, I'll set the last timer.  Because the last one is a little bit more specific, I guess. If you feel that you don't need the five minutes, it's okay, we'll just move to the next one.  But you can use it as much time as you want. Perfect, let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go!

18:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's Let's go!

19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's you

20:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I I think that's it. I don't have any more ideas. Got it.

20:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. I'll stop now. Okay, so now we have these three points of view on what you want to achieve.  So from a product, kind of product you want to deliver, the kind of vibe you want it to have and communicate and how we want it to communicate.  contribute to your personal life and you know our income and so on. And now I invite you to come down with me and try to connect with what this would be for your target market, okay.  And so basically we have less hostage here it's a little bit on purpose and at the end I mean there's space for three but ideally we'll have like only one or two for each row so we first do this part and then we do this part, okay.  So I'll set up a timer and I'll be with you I will not put a song now because otherwise when I talk to you it be weird.  Yeah but so the timer is going. So when you think about the audience the market for this who is this this person?  Okay I'm just going to turn off a little bit my camera because someone is going to be in the room.

22:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  for a bit and he's going to go away, just give me like 10 minutes and I turn my camera again, but I'm not interested in everything, okay?  No problem. With this I need to be answering with you or is it me just writing?

22:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You can write and I mean I'm here, you can write. I think the exercise of writing is useful for you as well.

22:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So you asked me, this six-week program is best for? What kind of person?

22:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do they do? Who are they?

22:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know if that's specific, do I need like an external profile or like inner profile? Because you know in this kind of process I have different kinds of like outside profiles, know like it could be an entrepreneur or it could be a coach for inner profiles, someone may be facing change or wanting new tools or maybe facing a crisis, but I have  I trying to define that, and it's been taking me like quite a while, but I've been moving to lots of leaders or executives, I think it's hard to get them.  And I also don't want to leave out, left out my heritage, people that want to heal. So that's why I'm just putting like user space in change, because I don't want to put myself just in the healing side, but you know, they need to work through trauma, but not through that kind of vocabulary.  So I'm thinking about, I have them here. Let me go to my notes. Yes, I have them here. So, we could say that I have coaches or therapies that once want to have my insights, my tools, my mindset, everything that I know, you know, that's what I was asking myself.  Why do people follow me? Not because my content is attractive or, oh, it's very entertaining, no, it's because I have knowledge and they want that knowledge.  could be coaches or that they want to be more effective in a way. coaches that want to have more effective methods in the psychedelic space, you know, and we are not close just with coaches that are psychedelic coaches, maybe executive coaching, life coaching, but they want better tools and I don't solve how to give a psychedelic.  It's because I have methodologies and I have frameworks and they like that, you know. So, coaches, the next one could be entrepreneurs.  And it's about how they can discover how their insights can drive significant projects. Because a lot of entrepreneurs like Silicon Valley, they dive into these experiences, but maybe they don't know how to bring them down to earth.  it's about also the program. It's about teaching, you know, to bring complexity and the abstract of the experience into actual impact, you know, so it's not just a tool for a coach or a tool for an entrepreneur that he's already, like he doesn't need like kind of support.  Like he wants to do it by himself, but I'm just a guy for him to do it. The coach is someone that wants my tools to provide the service to others.  And I have another one that we could say that it's the third one. Lots of people that follow me because they know what psychedelics are.  They have tried with psychedelics. They've been actually to my retreat so to they've done psychedelics lots of times and they call psychonauts Psychonauts are the explorers of the mind or square of the psyche.  I was thinking about explorers of consciousness But I cannot is something that That can go hand in hand or also I have a lot of seekers, you know people find me because they're seeking Oh, I found you because I was looking for our consciousness or Psychedelics and you pop up, you know, so these people that are ready.  It's been seeking so I don't know if that fits what you're looking for But I think this is the one I'd like to challenge you on on something.

26:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I Can definitely see I mean I see I see your point of all of these people and Given that we are designing a Product and this product will have some aspects of it are customizable, of course, but also  Part of them will be kind of standard for most people, right? Because it is standardization that allows you, Jorge, to have a little bit more free time and just people go through a process that is similar for many of them, right?  If this is the case, if we're developing a product where a lot of parts or a good amount of parts are standard, it's really valuable to have a super specific person in mind that is somebody that, in your experience, is the easiest person to convince, right?  So you've probably heard the expression, the early adopters? Yes, the early adopters, of course, the innovators.

27:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes. the people that, there's that book, right?

27:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Crossing the cousin.

27:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, crossing the cousin.

27:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so the idea behind the early adopters, and we use the expression so often that we kind of forget about this.  But the idea around the early adopters is that some people are really ready. They are waiting for you, right?  And they want to experiment with new things and so on. And some other people are like, they could be your market, maybe not for the first iteration of this product, maybe online.  And my challenge to you is, can we find someone like a specific, if you can think in your mind of somebody that you've worked with, like maybe it's a person you know, that's Maria, I know this is Maria, I'm creating this for Maria because there's more Maria's in the world.  This would be really helpful for the first iteration of the product. In the future, the product can expand. But for the first one, this would be really helpful.

28:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's do this. Let's get in my mood. So, of course, the best people for the retreats that it's different for what I'm selling now, the retreats, it's people that they want to heal trauma and heal their past and heal their inner child.  Someone that it doesn't matter the outside profile, it could be an entrepreneur, a CEO, it could be a housewife, it could be a doctor, it could be, you know, it's been, it's like this, it's so...  So, there's not like some external profile that it's like the most often, maybe it's a professional, it's someone who earns money, you know, through their professional, through their ability.  That's one of the inside, okay? They're professional that have money. And the thing that I found and the reason that I'm creating this is because people, when they leave their retreat, they're asking like, what's next?  They have the mindset for it. That's why I'm teaching the mindset, the tools, the... and skills, because people don't have that, you know, and yes, after the experience you're like, wow, I understand so much now, but then they go back to reality, it's okay.  The reality doesn't seem to fit to what I experienced in the psychedelic experience.

30:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was a special time and place, right?

30:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It was perfect, and I understood everything, and now my dad keeps telling me, I'm creating this for all of these profiles that they don't know how to integrate, you know?  And lots of people, I was looking at, there's lots of frameworks to go through this experience, but people are trying to work with the therapeutic framework because it's the only one they have.  Doing it alone and they don't want to go to therapy, so it doesn't work, so they need to have a new framework.  frameworks that are available there, plus how can you create your own framework so you can achieve what you want.  So in that, I'm going to land the idea. I think the best people that I can serve, it's been hard for me, maybe that's why I haven't defined it, because lots of people, they tell me, I'm here because I felt it.  It was my time, and you know, you don't know me, no, but I trust the universe. So that doesn't give me insight.  it's a lot of people come because of testimonials or recommendations. So you know, but most of the people that I have worked with that I like, it's the tech guys, technological guys, people that are in the tech industry, but they come because they're recommended by me, and they love my process, and they love my language, but they don't discover me through Instagram, they discover me because of recommendation, and then they are blown, you know, but that doesn't  That's why it's been hard for me to find the people because once you know me, you understand my process.  But if you don't know me, you won't trust in me, you know, you need to come with a recommendation.  So it's been hard to get those, but those are the ones that have the most amazing experience because they have the mindset, they have the tools, they have the project management, you know, they can move on.  And the ones that I think I can serve the most is the Psychonauts because they've done lots of psychedelic experience, they don't know the terrain, but they don't know how to land, they don't know how to progress with that.  if I need to eliminate one, I think I will eliminate the coaches because I have lots of coaching followers, but they are there because they want to copy my meta and I can send them through the become a psychedelic coach instead of this one.  This one we could, I was thinking, use your spacing change by talking to Maybe also like it's not entrepreneur because he doesn't have time but as well I'm in the six week to have it like Feeding their timing the two hours per week, you know, like it's really hot impact really It's it I'm not selling the psychedelic experience.  You do it on your own you do whatever you want here is to integrate You know, so I think those three are the The most But I don't know if I'm answering your question.

33:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm trying to land my ideas, you know, I think you know I understand this and you are you are I understand that is a difficult thing to do also because For me is also difficult to do this so I completely empathize with that you don't want you don't want to not Serve somebody that would be benefited from this But my suggestion is that we can look at this in the following way Surely right now as we speak there are people  well that would be perfect for you but they don't know you exist right so if you if you communicate to them you can get more of them and you as a client to me you are a perfect example of this you are like the perfect client for me like you understand what I do you value it you you participate between sessions you read stuff you are like the you are my icp right you only found me because I was trying to talk to a kind of a specific kind of person not exactly you but like a person that understands these things and I try to communicate that in some obvious ways and some non-obvious ways like the language I use and stuff like that so this this means that I'm not you know pointing at a lot of people but I'm pointing at enough people that make it really worth it so for you if you have this like personal experience like this is not an hypothesis you know this this technology guys they get you they value  If they like it, they tell each other because they're always talking on Twitter and in conferences and stuff This is a great To me it feels that this is a great First uh market, let's say because these guys make quick decisions.  They have money to spend and you know stuff like that So I love it. I think we will arrive at a good uh at a good Answer I think I think this will help help us When you think about these guys specifically maybe in your mind, you have like one guy, I don't know I need to have one guy, you know, so it can be more convincing Come again I need to have one guy like honestly to be more convincing, you know to really talk to it Because I have different people and you know, I need to focus first on one.  I think that's going to be Yeah, I mean and i'm sure like I'm sure you have this guy in your mind And sometimes you think oh if this program was about Integration maybe a seven would be the best  If this program was about exploration, I think it would be better. don't know.

36:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think this is the, for me, think now it's, this is the course that I would love to have.  To choose the guy. No, no, this is the course that the old Jorge would love to join. yeah, which is, which is fantastic.

36:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, this is a good direction.

36:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I never find, you know, about like the mixing of how I want to, to give it away because maybe for a lot of education and certification, no one, it's like what I want to give, you know.  So it's not being done before. that's why I'm creating something to my old me. And my old me is someone that he is proactive.  wants, he's looking for the knowledge. He knows what the psilocybin is. He knows the impact of then he wants to do something but he doesn't have the guidance you know yeah but at the end I think that's already subjective do you do you think we need to have like a like actual profile like that like technology leader or psychonaut or it's I think it helps yeah I think it helps a lot so it's a for me I think it's a psychonaut it's someone that he he wants it's someone like wants to explore the cycle but I don't know how can we name that guy okay okay but can we mix both because I'll tell you what I like about the technology leader the technology like what you said is an external aspect that you can see from the outside right you can you can know this guy's technology leader I see his profile on LinkedIn I know he right and this makes him an addressable market you can organize your content you can organize your advertisements you can organize like which podcasts you go to and stuff you can do this focus on also external

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  aspects. The Psyconaut is also possible, it's much more difficult to know exactly who is the Psyconaut. Maybe the guy that works in the  accounting department, sorry for the, it's a Psyconaut and you wouldn't tell just by looking at him, right?  So I think it's interesting to mix these two sides, the internal aspect, the Psyconaut I really like it, and also the external aspect, because the external aspect in a very practical sense will help you decide, oh, I need to make Google AdWords for these guys, know, this is helpful.  So I love that you've mixed both.

38:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, I think that's mixing, you know, Inner, it's a Psyconaut, he knows, he loves to grow and things, but in the outer it's a tech leader, you know, so we can be precise instead of just an entrepreneur or executive, it's a tech leader, and at the end it's someone facing change, every tech leader is facing change, you know, so.

38:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so based on this I have two questions for you. Okay. So the first question is, do you mind if I somebody something just arrived and I need to open the door for them?  Would you mind try to spend like this? I mean, it's thinking about the outcomes that this solves for this person.  Of course. Yeah. Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can. Okay. Thank you so much. No worries.

39:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank Thank

43:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm back, thank you so much Khorkhye. You want to move into the third line, you are on mute. Yeah, what's up?  So, you see that we are going through this process like we see the person we are trying to serve, we see like what we offer them in terms of a promise or addressing pain points and now the last line is kind of the how, right, how we get there.  What do we provide these technology leaders facing change and you know, psychonauts?

44:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How? I can give you an example if it's helpful.

44:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, imagine you're doing like a cooking class. Okay. And there's many things you could provide them in the cooking class.  For instance, you could provide them with just the rest. It could provide them with a recipe and the ingredients.  It could provide them with a checklist for going to the market and they buy the ingredients. It could provide them with a video, if you're cooking.  There's many things you could do for helping them on that specific goal, right? So what things do you provide them that will help them with this?  No, but I mean in the platform. So let me give an example. Is this video lessons? this a community space?  Is this instructions? Stuff like that. OK, perfect.

46:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ok, we're good.

46:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going skip So, given this stuff, and I think I was a little bit optimistic on time, is it clear to you how we could convert some of these things into project requirements?  For instance, you will need with a circle community, you will need a coaching, a group coaching script or a workshop platform, these kind of things.  Is it clear how you could convert that?

47:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Given this, what can we minor it? But is this question about what they're expecting to have? Yes, yes.

47:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I know this is a bit of an hypothesis, we're not entirely sure, right? But yes. And you can also go into the experience you have with working with these people firsthand and try to remember when they work with you what things made them really like your work, things that you already do, right?  Because sometimes people appreciate really simple aspects that for us they are very obvious, but for them, oh my God, this is transformative, right?  When you work with these guys, what's their reaction to, like you say they like your process, right? How do they know about your process?  Do you tell them about your process? It's a couple of slides. How do they find it?

49:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's about the user experience, know, they don't know about it until they're in and, you know, I like the methodology, like, how do you, how do you, you have a step-by-step, you have a structure method, you know, like, And how do you show them this?  mean, how do they, because I, they don't know, like, when I started, you know, I was just telling them, you're going to have a preparation evaluation, but they don't know what's evaluation, they don't know what's preparation, they don't know anything about it.  They, they trust, you know, and, and when they experience that, it's like, I like the structure of the process, how you send information and everything, maybe I need to communicate that, you know, for future, like prospects, you know, like, how it's my process, how my process actually looks, you know, they don't see it before, like, it's when they enter and they finish, you know, I like all the process, the explanations, know, everything, know, how I teach the...  program, how I interact with them, the professional language.

50:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay.

50:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's good.

50:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's good, because it seems to me that one of the requirements that they have, they didn't know they have it, but now that we are focused on them is that this kind of audience usually wants to know that there is a logic behind things, right?  Yes, that's structure. So one of the requirements is like, I want to be able to see or understand the structure, like, I would even go so far as to put another word next to structure, maybe visible, tangible, legible.  So some aspect like, okay, this is, this is a structure I can see, I can understand, right? A lot of these guys work in a project time of kind of work, they are used to deadlines, they're used to alignment between people, they're used to project management too.

51:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, they want to see the timeline of the process, what do we do in each workshop, the key activities, the results, they want to see that as well.  Okay, okay.

51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do they have like, does it make a difference for them when you explain why something is the way it is?

51:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, they trust more, you know, like, you know, when I tell them this is because of this, know, there's a reason behind it, it's like, oh, okay, you know, because, and they also come because of the knowledge, you know, like, they can go with anyone to do a psychedelic experience because there's two parts in their house, you know, like, US dollars, five bucks, just to buy some mushroom, where would I pay a thousand to go with you?  Yeah, so they come for the knowledge in a way, so they come for the knowledge. because they feel it right, they trust.  There are some unquantifiable things that also play a big factor, know, like lots of people, the most interesting technology leaders that I work with from Chile, they're like, it's my wife found you and she told me that I have to go with you, you know.  The other one is because, actually I'm here because he told me that I needed to take the experience with you.

52:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll say two things now. One of them I think it's just some research I've done and I think it's really interesting is that there are many kinds of knowledge, right?  And for instance, there's kind of knowledge that you could call it the technical knowledge, which is like the book knowledge, right?  And you also have, which is like the book smart and street smart, right? You have the technical knowledge, which is like book knowledge and you have the process knowledge which is the knowledge that comes up because you've done this thing many times and you realize things that do not come up in the books right and one of the things that research shows that tells people that you are an expert is when besides the book knowledge you also have this process knowledge like oh whenever people I'll just give a little bit of a theater right now so when you're talking to tech leader and you say look I know that the theory of psychedelic guided experiences says that you need 14 hours to recover from whatever in my experience I've noticed like it's it's like okay you need 14 to get back to zero but maybe in seven you can already drive I don't know I'm just inventing things right now but this sort of conversation when you compare what's in the books and what you've learned in firsthand is a sort of thing that really communicates that  done this that you know this stuff. So when you talk about the knowledge in the method, you can even go deeper and say, oh, I want to have opportunities in the six week programs to show people knowledge that I've learned firsthand, not just book knowledge, you know.

54:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, yeah, because they know I have the book knowledge. I'm always paraphrasing this author or this guy and I have the certifications, but I also have the process wisdom, you know.  He's done it, you know. He's been through it. He came back, you know. So they feel it. I think I got that.  Cool.

54:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is nice. I suspect we'll have this conversation a little bit later, but I suspect that for this audience, these things might mean more than the quality of the video.  you know sometimes I don't know I'm not this is just a little bit of a parenthesis this is just to give you an idea of ah so whenever we discuss what matters to people maybe we realize that some things that really matter are easier to do and some things that are very complex don't have as much impact as we expect them to have right this kind of stuff this kind of decision is only possible when we have a really good idea of who we're trying to serve otherwise we try to play it safe and just say I want it to be the best quality possible and which is difficult it's expensive to make quality things right it's like when people like buy a plug-in or like a new app in the technology technology leader is because it's going to make the process simpler yes yes it'll be more optimized so how are you optimizing you know how this how this product is going to optimize

56:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  my workflow. So they're looking for optimization in a way.

56:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's also a very interesting aspect of having a specific audience, which is you can use the language of your audience, right?  When you're addressing coaches, they have a certain kind of language that is different from the technology guys. And it's very different, right?  So when you make analogies like, oh, this is like an API or whatever, they're like, oh my God, this guy understands me, right?  And if you say API to a coach, I mean, most of them will not understand what it means. So let's move into the next one.  And this one is more for you, okay? So it might be easier because we've already done a little bit of it.  Let me bring you to me. So we are creating these things so that you can something, something, and this will be valuable for you for some reason.  while avoiding something that you do not want right so I'll give you the five minutes because it's more personal I will not talk so much I'll just put a song on and let you feel the okay I love these classes it feels like a class it's you  You you

1:00:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  you You you You You You I can hear you.

1:02:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  His buttons on the microphone, I forget.

1:02:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, no.

1:02:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm dealing with the professional. mean, I need to up my game. I'll ask you about that later because I've been intrigued about it.  I'm not like a big tech guy.

1:02:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes.

1:02:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes so much sense, your target market, right? So, let's do the same thing we did before. was for you.  Yeah, so what's the requirements for you? Yeah, you got it. I'll give you another timer and I'll change the song.  You

1:04:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  you You you you I You I think I'm ready. You ready? Look, I draw John. Come again?

1:07:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I draw John.

1:07:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  John is our tech guy.

1:07:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, nice. Nice. You put it on your, you put it, put him on your wall and look at him every day.

1:07:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm going to do that because he's like me, you know. And I just saw, I don't know if you know that golden coach just to close this idea but the golden coach just said something interesting that you need to go to a profitable market and there are three keys.  One is a big pool of people. So I think the technology guys are quite big. The pool, it's quite enough.  They need to have a big problem. all the tech guys. they're facing change you know and they're facing you know stress they're facing burnout and they're facing something so they have a big problem that maybe this solution can give them clarity and they have big pockets so I see that the tech guys are good you know I have a few friends from Mexico that they work for American companies because they pay better you know and all the programmers and all of these guys they are what you know it's more like they go beyond the the average people you know the average profession you know they're like they're needed in this space it's the same thing here in Brazil if you work for I mean I have several friends because I used to work in a tech company right I worked in tech companies before and I have some friends that yeah they do that they they work for US companies they get paid in dollars they're much cheaper than the American guys but they're quite good the time zone is basically the same so it's  This is only going to increase for sure.

1:09:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So nice, nice The exciting but I don't want to get carried away. I need to find data.

1:09:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe you can help me to you know about the tech guys, you know, I have found you know, like About you know, the employees, know, they're satisfied and things like that But it's like overall the employees.  I haven't checked on the tech guys But there's something that I need to research on but what let's continue so we can get the best out of This Cool, I do have some stuff.

1:09:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you I'll just made a note so quickly Like I'll zoom out. Let me bring you to me.  So I'll zoom out we've discussed The business goes for you the gold definition for them the gold definition for you and now we're going into the Project boundaries, right?  So I left time here because it's really easy to fill to fill, right? when I think about the project boundaries in terms of time, I'll just write it here, meet-gen, and this is about the launch, right?  But I also want to have a second set of things down below, and these things are about the time limitations in terms of not building it, but running it in the future, okay?  So, yes, so let's say that you say, you know what, I want to build this thing and I can do like a really intense sprint to build this thing, but after that I want to spend like one hour each week on this.  That will change the kind of things we can make, right? And if you say after this I want to spend eight hours a week on this, that's different kind of product, right?  So having that understanding is useful. What do mean one, two, two, I mean, is two other people? in the circle maybe having someone that just the technical support you know like okay so I don't I can't work less hours if I have an admin you know assistant maybe assistant assistant maybe okay perfect and in terms of resources and this resources aspect it's tricky because a lot of things are resources right but for us I'd like us to think about resources in terms of tools hardware software stuff like that that we know we will need okay for this I'll put it I'll put a timer but no no music so we can just talk about it you said you want the circle community do y'all do you already have like the sign there okay so circle it's good

1:12:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Also, we're going to mean, can I use Notion?

1:12:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you already have Notion, right?

1:12:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe we use Loom for that.

1:12:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You mean the paid Loom or the free Loom?

1:12:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Right now I have the free Loom, but I'm changing Loom for Peach. Peach I have to take Peach. I have T-Suit and iCloud.  The f-step for like automation, email automation? You know, this is something that I need to decide, but I would love to have, I don't know, be high for...  I don't know which one is better. Sorry about that.

1:12:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just write something about automation and then we'll figure it out. I've also been looking at that stuff, and there's so many options, and they seem the same, but they're not the same.

1:13:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I mean, I haven't decided what I'm between floaters, kit, sub-stack, or v-hike, but Chirco also have like a marketing thing, so I don't know if I have just one centralized, you know, so.

1:13:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would say not to use sub-stack, because sub-stack is not so good for automations. Okay, and if you want to like the onboarding email, and oh, I see that you are stuck at the lesson, something, something, you know, stuff like this.  I think sub-stack is good for that. Sub-stack is more for newsletters. And I've learned this the hard way. So I would call it maybe not email marketing, because I think it's very broad.  I'll call it like email automation, because then you get a little bit more specific. What else? There's something else here.

1:13:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let me just make sure. But when I want to do the lounge, you know, I want to maybe do a pre-lounge in meet like meet John and the actual lounge.  And February, well, lounge doesn't mean the start of the program. The start of the program, I think it's the, it could be the last, I think 27 or 28 of February.  Got it.

1:14:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. That's good. That's good question. Do you have like one resource is an email list of people that could be interested in this?  Yes.

1:15:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, okay That's very good But also I'm trying to get lots of emails when I like do the pre-lounge, you know, you know, so I have Well, yeah, I have like a 500 email list guys that have done to my retreat You know, I have more than 500 people that have gone through my retreat So I have people that are very interested in this one Good and do you have because I understand that you'll have content like video content Will you make the edits of that or you will hire somebody?  I have a marketing They're doing my marketing that they do but they produce my videos. They do all my Instagram marketing so I have these guys On board so that it good good Mmm, so you have the hardware really record it

1:16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At home, we'll go to a studio to record the stuff.

1:16:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We're going to record it here at home and the workshops, you know, they're recorded, I have my camera. It's a Fujifilm H2.  It's one of the best. I just film myself. I get good quality. I can do all of those things by myself.  I just send the videos to the team and they can do the things that they need to do. And for the workshops, it's just me.  Not good.

1:16:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. it. So let's go over this stuff and whatever you don't have, you mark it in bold. Just click command B and just make it bold.  Okay. On the resources, please.

1:16:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Whatever I don't have, I what? I put it in black? Yeah, in bold. Or I can change color to yellow.  Okay, perfect.

1:16:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect.

1:17:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, let's see if have some things here. There's so much specific that maybe I don't need it for this time, like I want to have lower, like someone doing me the lower thirds when I do the videos or some, oh, in resources can we put the landing page or it doesn't do any resources?

1:17:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it goes on and even makes me think of

1:18:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  it's kind of a funnel right yes kind of a funnel yeah so right funnel and I understand that you don't have a funnel yet uh okay so still talking about boundaries do you have like boundaries related to costs or the investment you need to make on this for this first version right just maybe week my investment I have invested already lots of money you know in my knowledge that doesn't that doesn't count right so let's see right now for for this now and go right in my costs it's up to not counting what I have invested you know just from now from now on okay 3k no more okay 2k USD right 3k USD yeah this is good because this will help us

1:19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  make decisions further down. Perfect.

1:19:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Got it.

1:19:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I want to show you something else. I'll bring you to me. Something beautiful or something nice? Maybe, maybe both.

1:19:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  don't know. So this is technique I really like.

1:19:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It helps us prioritize stuff. Can I ask you something really fast?

1:19:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes.

1:19:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Who taught you all of this?

1:19:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or how to do this? Have you worked in a corporate before? Or do you work in a corporate before?  Yes.

1:19:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I came to Brazil to work in a impression consulting company. On that company, I've worked on like really boring clients, like big clients.  And so how to make decisions in big groups, I think. And then I was really interested in this sort of thing we're doing now.  I didn't know the name of it. And I realized that this was called product management. I did some courses on it because  I was not sure I would be good at it. I had this idea that the people that did it was like they knew how to do everything.  They could program computers, and they could do it. I had this misconception. So I did some courses on it, and I realized, oh, OK, I think I can do this.  And then I got a job doing that. And I did that job for like three years. But I mean, I was doing this thing before.  Didn't have that name in my mind, right? And then I got really tired of the corporate world. Boring as .  it hit boring, right? It's boring. It's boring, and it doesn't care. It's not even cruel. It doesn't care. It doesn't have a soul.

1:20:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It doesn't have a soul. And then I got fired in a layoff.

1:20:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And that thing really, I mean, I don't want to take too much from this session.

1:20:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm open to talk about this.

1:20:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm really open about it. But basically, when I got fired, that thing ridiculized me. I was like, I will never work for these guys again.  I need to work on my own. And I think I can do it. And then I started talking about this stuff.

1:21:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But you earned good money, at least?

1:21:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right now, I don't earn as much as I was earning before.

1:21:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, in corporate, did you earn good money? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so.

1:21:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think so. You're good to earn lots of money.

1:21:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you have a really good product? you use it to also productize it then? Yes.

1:21:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're an early adopter.

1:21:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You need to get to the most market. True.

1:21:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much for saying that. Yeah, I feel I'm in the zone of what I know how to do when I win.  do these things, so it confirms my feelings when you say that. Thank you. So basically, so getting back to it.  So this prioritizing framework. There are many prioritizing frameworks. What I like about this one is called Moscow. What I like about this one is that it works really well when you don't have much data.  It's a new product. When you start to have more data, maybe you choose other prioritizing frameworks, but for the moment we are at now this one is a good one and You can read faster than what I can you already know what this means, right?  Basically, we are thinking about this in iteration, right? So the first iteration is the one you will you will launch February 27 right Maybe I mean not maybe but surely there will be another others and for those you do other things but for this one We'll focus on this for Questions we need to answer.  Okay, and the good thing is that we already have the answers for this We just need to bring them from up there and I'll bring them down.  Sorry. I'll bring them down and you'll just organize them across What is necessary what could have been what could be what what is not I'm just pasting them here and You feel free to  to place them in their own spots. Okay. I know I'll change these orange ones. I'll change them into green ones.  So we don't get the costs later. These green ones. Okay. So we will just drag this and figure out, based on the conversations we've been having today, we know that we need the keynotes and the classes done.  Okay. That's probably. But we can decide that there's something that we will not have right now, not for this version and that thing, whatever, we drag it here.  Okay. And that's it. So I'll put a timer to it. I'll put three, I'll put a five minute timer.  With no music, so we can talk you and I and I'll invite you to select The things that going to must have should have could have will not have and as you know You can put 25 things in the first one and five in the other ones If something it's on the way like the branding it's in the must have or because it's on the way Like they're doing it, but I don't know where to put this one But maybe not at the full deployment, you know, so I think I won't have the full deployment of the brand Make sense to me You

1:25:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I must have this, I must have this. These are not ready and won't be ready until I tell the project.  It's like when you sell a construction site, know, I have a lot of from the, from the development construction and they have lots of projects, but they don't have the actual price, you know, they need to sell it and then they do the construction and then they deliver, you know, and they always take ages, even though people know that when they say they're going to deliver, they're never going to deliver that, so I don't know how they handle this.  You know what they're doing now in Brazil?

1:25:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They just, they just give a ridiculous date, like, oh, this will take like four years. It doesn't take four years, it takes like two.  And then they say, oh, we deliver the head of schedule. That's what they do now. should have, could have.  On the blue ones, let me make a quick suggestion. I will try to frame this like a time structure, a time line of modules, activities, and results.  Okay, so this one, I think, could just incorporate many of the other ones.

1:26:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's kind of the same as the program outline, each module information, and time line. Which is great, because one of them is something you need, and the other one is something they need.

1:26:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So by doing that, you make sure that it makes sense to them.

1:26:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So modules is...

1:27:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Some of these aspects that you're trying to rephrase now, if they don't make sense because they are too abstract, it's okay, you don't need to place them.

1:27:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  They're going to have this board, they're going to have this, I don't know your work class, but they're going to have their workshops because it's part of the program.

1:27:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's interesting, this thing you just did now, it's very easy to say, oh, it's a requirement to have a world-class workshop, right?  That's an easy thing to say. When we're having a discussion like, oh, is this like I really must have this?  And then it's very natural for us to say, you know what, they must have something. But it doesn't have to be the best in the world.  It becomes an easy conversation to have, otherwise.

1:28:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Now I understand that it doesn't have to be perfect. But at least I need to have everything online. Yes, yes, yes.

1:28:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what I found for myself, maybe it's the same for you, maybe it isn't, is that if I understand what are the trade-offs that I'm making, if that's visible, I'm not scared of missing stuff that I thought, oh my god, this is great idea.  I don't want to forget it. And because I'm afraid of forgetting the idea, I think, I need to do it right now.  If I make it visually like this, I'm like, I will not forget the idea. This will always be here.  I can come back to it and figure it out again. So it allows us to empty the RAM memory, another analogy for the technology dudes.  OK. So let's check these out just for a while. for a smell test so it must have a community circle perfect program program is a big word so i'm curious about yeah the circle it's already it's it's an application you know i can show you what i already have like i know i know what it is i know what it is i mean some circles um what i mean with program it's have the spaces outline having like the ground rules like like introduce like introduce yourself here and having everything like like all these instructions instructions ready and you know i have like a loop you know just go inside and you'd be like overview of all of those things yeah yeah perfect perfect workshops uh clearing res a resistible offer book knowledge process wisdom the knowledge and the method support library okay perfect  should have, we are open to the idea of not having, but it should have a website of landing page for details, focus on paid ads, classes done, workshop with your own framework and canvases.

1:30:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  With that I mean that like I can first start with the people that I have and I would love to have the landing page, but maybe it's something I don't need to fight with my mind, maybe I can build it up and the same with the ads, it's the same thing because the ads are going to send them to the website where everything needs to line up and things, but maybe that's for the second cohort, but I can keep just having it in mind so we can develop it, so as soon as we finish the first cohort it's already launched, you know like.

1:30:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly, exactly and you already have your own website so sometimes we think that we need a full new thing and sometimes we don't.  People already know your stuff. So email automations could have we are quite open to the idea that you might not have at this point onboarding automation affiliate marketing branding it won't have for now not the full one and Mastering visual thinking and visualization consulting.  It's something that's it's ongoing, right? mean, it's it's an horizon Cool So with this in mind, let's me scroll back for a second with this in mind we've we've Defined the project goal and both for the target market and for you and we've also come up came up come up with some Requirements and we will get back to these requirements later on like in the tomorrow session at some point Oh, this would be nice.  It's like we look at this like no. Yeah, it would be nice that won't be for now, right? That that's going to be annoying.  I think So let me just make a quick recap You So far, are you satisfied with this, with the way this looks?

1:32:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes, yes.

1:32:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's make a quick recap. We had three success goals, right, for this. Arriving at the business goal definition, figuring out the project boundaries, and developing criteria to help us prioritize later.  And the way this helps us is we now have a North Star for the project. Whenever the winds start to pull us away, we have a North Star for the project.  And we also have requirements that they're not just from our imagination. They make sense for the thing we're aiming at.  We also are more aware of, oh, apologies, I did not bring you to me. We also are more aware of what's possible and what's not possible for now.  And we are more prepared to make hard decisions. We have clarity on what matters the most.

1:32:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And we are also prepared to make decisions. not just hard, but consistent decisions, right?

1:33:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the deal is, if the way we make decisions changes all the time, the decisions we make throughout the project, they don't have coherence.  Like this one is about making something for everybody. This one is about making something that's super premium. And at the end, the project is not coherent.  But now that we have these things, it's easier to keep it coherent. And I've left this lighter green ones in case you want to write something that this helps you that was not written here.  OK. You don't have to. It's optional. Good. And yeah. So in the next session, we will break down the project into smaller parts.  This is a common step of project. Breakdown system, work breakdown structure, and this is table stakes for this sort of thing, we'll put everything up here.  I've already put the main timelines here, and this thing is an example.

  I can't see it, but it's okay, let me go to your How you don't see it? No. What do you see?  It says request access.

1:34:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, can you request that access? Let's see.

1:34:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm clicking request access. No access to word, request access, request send.

1:34:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let me open my email. You

1:35:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  First, Elizondo, OpenShare Settings.

1:35:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, OK, OK. I understand what's wrong. My mistake, apologies. I will correct this. Because I usually place this stuff in a different mirror board.  OK. And when I place this stuff, so Timeline, beta. Oh, I suppose you can see it. Yes. But I'll need to organize it better.  It was asking for access to the boards that I used to assemble things. I'll fix this one, for sure.  Anyway, so I'll keep this one for correcting it later. And that's it. How do you feel? How do you feel right now?

1:35:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool. Good. I like the method. I have another question. How long did it take you to do this by the template?  to put the template together. And to define which one to use.

1:36:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it took me like two hours to define the structure, maybe two and a half hours to think about the exercises and what it made the most sense.  I did a little bit of studying into project management for these kind of things. And I think that it was two hours, 1,500 maybe.  And putting together what you see now, I think it was also an hour and a half because I was doing it kind of from scratch in this new system that I'm creating for myself.  Because my idea, I can show you, mean, look, I'll share this stuff. This is the other mirror I use where I assemble things now.  This is a new process for me, right? I put it together here and then I copy a paste there.  But I make sure that everything is kind of the same style. I have some elements like the time elements or stuff like this and that's what I'm doing now Like so you have it ready.

1:37:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So you don't lose time, right?

1:37:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is the first time I have it ready because I mean I Put like between last week in this week I think I put together like three or four workshops for different things and I'm like always doing the same sort of Exercises they change a little bit like but it's usually like collect ideas filter ideas collect ideas Bring up to the surface all the person is thinking about this You know help I hope the people build a sentence that conveys what they mean And that's a couple of like I call them primitives like the basic elements and these basic elements I reuse But yours the session we just have now was the first time I used like this design this particular design for To make it you know quicker and more consistent as well because I think

1:38:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think it goes well with the style, right?

1:38:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, simple and intuitive.

1:38:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's what we want.

1:38:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Thank you for saying that. That's nice. Jorge, this will be the link we'll be using for everything. You'll always have this link no matter how much stuff we do afterwards or not is your link.  I will correct this thing to be editable by us. And tomorrow we'll have a session that will be a breakdown session.  So we'll think about this objective. So to do that, I need this thing and it's going to be less exercises but more time on the same exercise.  It's probably one or two exercises at the most. Perfect. Yeah.

1:38:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:38:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Head of last. Thank you. Thank you for being always such a willing participants and optimistic and sharing so much with us.  Of course, thank you.
