0:00 - A L
  Hello. Hello.

0:04 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Long time no see.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, I don't think we have anything much new from yesterday to today.

0:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  I just created a storage there, but I remember you actually showed something to us, but I don't remember if I created a story for you just to go over it on the daily.  It's in this design board and I think I assigned it to you. No, I didn't. Maybe it's not in the sprint.  I know it's not in the spring. Go to backlog, please. I forgot to add it to design sprint. So, there you will find click on your last one in the backlog.  Yeah.

0:46 - A L
  This is just a reminder. We can delete it.

0:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  We decided it's done or whatever, basically we need a delete button on that policy, training and communication page. Just put some delete button.  Do we not create that? I'm not sure that's why I just want to check so yeah if we have them or good then we can delete it and if if not then then just edit when you have time.  Got it so this is important because it's related to policies.

1:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Okay. So we can send you some stuff on control in a little while on Slack, sending it right now  Controls. It would be...

2:06 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Let's share the screen so I leave them more calm. Share it so I have to follow it. Okay.

2:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll show you what we have so far. And with the caveat that... It's changing as we speak. Okay.  Share this down. Okay. Follow you. Perfect. Perfect. So, okay. This is useful. This was the template. Just an example of how we could look like.  And this is our implementation of it in the design is not finished, so let's just focus on the main directions.  This is the name of the control. This is a description of the control. And in this case, we're talking about external controls, right?  So we're talking about organizations that we have this control applied to. Of course, these status could be different. I mean, we just the names are different.

3:28 - Romeu Rodrigues
  We'll change the colors, you know, the usual stuff.

3:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then by clicking here, we would have access to this menu, the rest of data or other options. where is this again?

3:40 - A L
  It is like when you click on the first control, then you go into one of that for that control, like you get a conflict of interest.  And then the next page would be that or conflict of interest.

3:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct. And then and then the users would be the user name to see.

3:56 - A L
  Yes, so it's the same mechanic between.

4:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  internal and external controls. It just changes when it's external. talk about an organization. When it's internal, we say a person, employee, and release employee.  are my forms on the right then? This name needs to be changed, but we're just reusing the component for tasks.  Because the idea is like we said here. We call it like tasks or to-dos and not that.

4:29 - A L
  Yeah, yeah.

4:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly. There's a change.

4:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Go ahead. Just a quick comment.

4:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Please maybe better that we start with not.

4:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean, I know it's just a semantics right now, but it's best we start with user names, not companies because of your companies will come as part of third party later.  So let's try to immediately think about users here. It will be a bit easier also for the designer to know.  I know it is just text right now, but. Yeah, and then I would say not answer. do you not have an anti-racism day?

5:02 - A L
  call it conflict of interest because it's a little bit confusing on top. So we know it's one of the controls and then maybe my forms would be tasks.  And then in the in progress would actually be in progress. Yeah, then we need to take it because all of them are conflict of interest.  So there'd be like many conflict of interest ones that come in. It's like conflict of interest more or no?

5:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's not let's not get too much into this.

5:31 - A L
  The idea is there's just a quick way and it's very easy to just take this out.

5:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just a very quick way for a compliance officer to look at the specific control and see if there are tasks related to that control that need to be done like oh somebody will need to get approval soon because it's expiring, right?  But so what you suggested here was to change it too?

5:54 - A L
  Like conflict of interest or just pick one of the controls maybe like conflict of interest declaration. Title of the control, think that's what she means.

6:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  it should be title of control if it's not already, I'm not sure. But okay, I'd say that's less relevant right now, but yeah.  Yeah, my point was more to not focus on the company, but focus on the users because users will be here.  That will probably drive a little bit the design because depending on if it's a company, you have some different fields and some different things than if it's internal employee in here.

6:29 - A L
  So I think we should think in that direction.

6:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  For now, later we can extend what we do, we can extend it for companies that are external.

6:39 - A L
  Yeah, company name just right, Abby Lynn, just write some fake names, Romeo, where company name is, so I would like so then people know.

6:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, just another question, Romeo, algum motivo para ser paginado? They are more likely to not have it for people like that, right?  No, probably there be many people, but if I had imagined it, the filter would have broken, right?

7:10 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Even the best is not to be imagined, it be cut.

7:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let's translate this. Our question here was do we keep tabbing or pagination, I don't know how call it, and filters?  And our suggestion is to take away this, remove this, because then it gets confusing. If you're using filters and the thing that you're using.

7:35 - A L
  In the usability of this as a compliance officer, having five names doesn't help me unless they're filtered. Ideally it's a longer list, because it's always going to be a longer group of employees that you need to see.  So I'd rather see it all rather than tab it so they can see. And then I guess we would have to have some kind of statistics on this.  I don't know, even on top of how many complete, how many are done, or maybe it has to be on this page.  that we had but then it would be useful because then I get an overview like if I it was just just the names I'd have to count like are there's that seven you know out of 12 like it doesn't help me in in like the results of the questionnaire I would like you know the questionnaire complicated vectors 85 have filled it in 45 have not responded you know like some kind of that would be helpful on this page rather than each individual name or if I don't know maybe that goes like the reporting aspect of it like you know that I'm just like what do we hope that the use of this page that's an excellent question so the and I ask your point so the way we drew this and you can be changed of course but the way we drew this was this is a simple place for you to check everything about control right and if and the way you check if there's something missing from that control would be on the to-do thing but I understand your point that maybe having some numbers at the top would be be good and of course since we have a table we can also filter it right you can just see

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  people that are not, yeah, then we need like probably more than five, but like maybe like 20 at a time or something.

9:06 - A L
  That's how I've seen other compliance tools. You just see a lot of names on it. But then I guess it's like, again, I guess even like that, I guess we can always duplicate it, right?  Because eventually you don't want to go into each individual control. Maybe when you're working on the control, like, because I'm trying to clean out conflict of interest and get it all done, this is helpful.  But at one point, like, if I'm not ready, I would like to have that dashboard, like, you know, in the first page, you know, before the compliance map, you just have an overview of everything.  And I guess that's just a mirroring of whatever is down here, right? we need both. Yeah, I agree.

9:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  And I think both is fine. So this is like detail view, which you will need occasionally. And then, but you always start from the top, you always start from some kind of broad overview.  And then you dive deeper where you need to. So this is fine. And we can have it connected to the pages before.  Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay.

9:54 - A L
  So so then, because I guess where does this come in? Because you have like the first The first flow is that like even before you start chasing on the deployment pages is kind of how we see it's like the deployment what you're doing is kind of the deployment in between there's like a step of like the first time is actually reviewing the conflict of interest register and is it good enough right before you even deploy it.

10:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe I can try to explain so currently. I understand so what we need here is a different on the top of being like have you reviewed the conflict.  So what we need here is there's the status of the policy applied to the person like this person has signed the thing the policy of the control, but there's also the status of the thing itself like as this thing being approved.  You know, correct.

10:50 - A L
  So it was at the top.

10:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I understand. Yeah, but not that.

10:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  So before you do that, where would you go and see the content of control and if you. to where would the control builder be?  So I think the page we are seeing is interesting after you deploy the control. But before you deploy control, this page would probably be useless because two out of three widgets here won't be populated.  So I would say we need basically not two pages, but two statuses of the same page. Same like we have with policies.  You remember policies? You have policy page where you see the policy, and then you have a deployment over you where you see deployment.  Can be similar to that something. this is good. We are just missing the part before the deployment.

11:38 - A L
  Yeah, because we have a deployment one. What I think is like, yeah, if you go from like, I click conflict of interest, and then you go straight to the conflict of interest questionnaire.  It's a little odd. So it's like, almost you need a page in between being like, hey, you want to deploy the thing here and then look at you go there or close it.  And then once you wait it or like something like that.

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's it, right? Explanation before setting up a form. Yeah.

12:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, so there may be... you're sending the approval. No, no, I understand.

12:08 - A L
  We are mixing two things.

12:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I totally get the need to include the approval and the overview for the deployments. So we need to talk about that.  And that's the thing. And the separate thing is, how do we not drop people into complex things that they don't understand yet?  And for that, we would be using this component and this template, this pattern, of explaining it with a carousel before you jump into sending a form to someone.  then like... Okay.

12:48 - A L
  Now I'm just thinking of like, if you go to the front page, it's like conflict of interest declaration. And then, yeah, maybe it's in the top part of the form that...  What a conflict of interest declaration is and why do you want to do it and why is it important like that would go in Maybe the top of the actual questionnaire, which we don't have right now.

13:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe even is that like I Understand like right now it's abrupt in how it is It's like you click on this and then you suddenly go into a question And you're like what am I doing like here like so maybe on the top of the questionnaire like we have that like you know That little guy You need to approve this conflict of interesting and then it that I approve that I don't know It's just like it's a the thing is the dialogue that the job also has the same purposes that so we can maybe use that So I think joey's to the right of this here the pop-up also because I mean It's basically the purpose is to help user understand what's going on So we can show this when you first come through control We can show we can have a header we can have both it's up to us to decide  What's too little and what's too much information for you?

14:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we have like a set of tools we can explain things to people like the simplest tool It's just to write it in a descriptive way and we have eye buttons and then we have like pop-ups and then we have like Confirmations and emails so there's we have many ways of doing that and we are applying those templates in this pattern so the platform so I Think it's it's on a good track So but just to make sure we understand this let's let's begin because this is an example where a control has been deployed to someone, right?  and I understand what what we need to discuss is what happens before the control So I click there on the control and this control is Empty okay, and I need to do okay now.  I'm using the mouse. I need to first Edit Or create and then I need to deploy it, right? Yeah, but that's also be done.  Yeah, exactly like it's like the policy management, right?

15:09 - A L
  So if it looks like that's Let's just let's just copy that thing We don't right now we don't have like on our our control form We haven't built that like confirmation and then deploy.  Yeah, we have we have we have approved I would have a tool I think we don't have deploy but I think we have a pro I have to check Yeah, it should be you can be the same flow as we have our policies for example Yeah, so I think like maybe Romeo can just kind of take the policy like dark blue background And then like stick a form in there that makes it look like that and then we can follow the other form the other No, what we need I believe is just status of an empty state, right?

15:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because what happens an empty state is when you open something that there's nothing there and we We haven't designed that so we need this this version when the control is not ready  and then there's a button that takes us to that kind of look that you describe the deployment of review.  okay, we are at the stage of the process that we can reuse a lot of things, which is great.

16:14 - A L
  Yeah, so I've made a note here and we'll discuss this thing for sure.

16:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so yeah, that's what we have for now and share this tab. We've put carbon reporting for offices on hold yesterday, because other things were more relevant.  Romeo, any questions, any questions, any questions?

16:43 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, I'm to improvise on this one right here, so that we can talk about some progress. Where is this one?

16:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I haven't finished it yet, I'm asking.

16:51 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay, I'm to pull it here, okay?

16:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is it called?

16:58 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's such a meh-meh.

17:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of priorities, are these still the priorities? We need to add the delete button for trainings policies and comes, and we also need this this approval thing, got it, let's type history and asks, okay, update the send for read only view of firm submissions, okay, yes.  I think this will take a while, because there's so many forms. Yeah, is this, is this like compared to other tasks, because this is not a functionality aspect, right, it's just an appearance aspect.  I'm not saying it doesn't matter. But I'm thinking that maybe other things matter most more.

18:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  so I will probably in like five or 10 minutes have a control that I can show you to follow how it's currently implemented.  So maybe we can jump on a call in five minutes, nothing more than that. And then I can show you how we currently have it so that we can maybe do some smaller changes to it so that we save some time, if you wish.  Let's do that.

18:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so for now, I think this is it.

18:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

18:31 - A L
  Okay, but there's enough for Romeo to work on, I guess, until the next meeting then. Yeah. I think so.

18:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

18:41 - A L
  Yeah, and then we, I think, yeah. And then I guess you'll discuss with him about the carbon reporting that you've been discussing with Brighton today on that because we need to get that designed.  Like, Yvonne, I guess your team is ready. Like, we're deploying today. We have to deploy. We have to send it out today, no matter what, like, or at least send it to them tomorrow.

19:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  then what are we talking about now release or something like we need to release my thing after that release like that's going out tomorrow when do you need like controls when you start working on controls or like is there still enough on your yeah we have enough of things for this week I would pay for this release stuff not release but we today discusses we have the deletion function on the back and front and make million back and work and there are some other times that we did so we have work at least for a day or two for sure even more probably we do then like like let's hope I don't know if it's possible to have the discussion with carbon reporting so that we can have some drawings for Monday when they start working on that so then we have that or the other the control is still we don't have to have carbon reporting to the thing to draw so today if we can have that that would be even better if we can have that not tomorrow of course but maybe Monday or something early next week then that would be great to start working on that part also  Yeah. It depends on how quickly can we get something, but we have work to do. We won't be waiting for work, at least not this week.  Okay.

20:11 - A L
  Yeah. we could just see what we can get done. ideally, I don't like, are we still on track to be able to get controls done in two weeks then?  We keep saying that a release, but this release is a little bit late and then what do we need to program?  guess is it?

20:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the most time we can spend, I think we, okay, so, yes, I think we have on the design side, we have clarity enough to transform those sketches into designs that then the development team can code.  And I'm assuming that because there are forms that are relatively easy, this should not be a massive task, but I don't want to make predictions on somebody else's work.  So I don't think this would be difficult. Managing the forms for controls. I believe that the most important thing for us right now is to get a lot of clarity on like, do we have the right forms?  Are these the right questions? Because otherwise we'll get to the edge of sending that to development and then stop it.  And then we will stay.

21:18 - A L
  Yeah, why the last few minutes like when do we have time to like tomorrow I'm back to back on meetings all day but Brighton is free also if you need any more help or about the carbon aspect of it.  Otherwise I have some time on Friday and more hours break on Friday to like talk through any of the forms or any of the things that we need to ask because I we still have to go through third party after this right I control this one thing but the third party is like going to be another big thing that's coming after and the quicker we can get to that though we've talked about it.  So I don't know Xiaowen are you free tomorrow or or like what do you need?

21:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tomorrow is a little bit tight but Friday I do

22:00 - A L
  time same time today uh same yeah same time today okay um is there anything um I'll just like uh just like I have to answer this call okay um I can I can put in one for um yeah for Brighton and me on Friday at the same time that we had from two to three thirty Do you think Mustafa can join perhaps?  probably not maybe even can join I think Mustafa is still sick so so in that case yeah I wouldn't bother even uh I think our discussion will be like two weeks ahead of I mean I'm open to it but no I think it would be great if we could keep Yvonne on to development because we're kind of down a resource with you with Mustafa six so like if you can yeah we can bring him in I think it's more that we need to unlock some of the things in my brain and then also maybe document some of the things that Brighton has been looking at so that we can start visualizing it and not  of seeing what is, you know, what needs to be fixed on that, but we have that time in. is there anything that we have a meeting tomorrow?  Tomorrow I probably won't be able to make it, but Brighton I think can just join that. But yeah, is there anything that we can prepare since we can't meet tomorrow to make things easier for Friday?

23:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so for Friday we'll use Friday to talk about controls, correct?

23:29 - A L
  I guess if it's the next one in like so it'd be great to be able to see some designs for Friday so that we can maybe discuss and see if we're missing anything or any content or I don't know or like you feel like I don't know what you mean.  I don't think we'll have a lot of design for Friday.

23:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can have maybe a little bit more detailed wireframes, yeah, I don't and I gotta say Romeo works fast, okay?  So this is a fast written work for design, so... I don't think we should only be able to discuss this based on design.  So I can make some wireframes, some low fidelity boxes, and we can discuss that. Maybe we can use Friday to really stress test that, and when we send it for Romeo and then later for development, there's no rework because we thought really the edge cases, we thought them through.  If we do that, I think it's great. Okay, great.

24:28 - A L
  Brighton, maybe we can look to some of the forms to see whether or not we can make it more user-friendly, I think, and then that might be easier to design too, but I think also Romeo is designing some of those forms already.  but I don't know what else if we can do anything. Yvonne, is there anything else that you need that we can help on the content side to make it?

24:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, so let me just quickly, before we move off, know you probably tired from all the meetings, but let me just quickly show you this.  This is on our test environment and you all have access to this. Let me share it quickly. Just I'll take five minutes.  I won't take any more than that. Just for control stuff. I just want to show what we have and what's already working or should be working probably.  It's a buggy because we didn't test it. here, this is under controls. You cannot access it. have to access it through LinkedIn, you cannot click here, but it's here.  And then here you can open a control. And this is now the part that we are missing currently. So it's like preview of how does control look and then you have to approve it.  Oh, yes, I'm sure. And then you deploy it. Yes, I'm sure. Then you pick and use it. And now the control is deployed.  Why is this missing?

25:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't get it.

25:38 - A L
  We killed the link because when we test it, we don't want people to go into We don't want people to go into these parts of the app because it's not ready.

25:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, no, but that's why it's available.

25:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you open the form, you said this is missing. Yeah, there's like an intro missing.

25:54 - A L
  right now, I think like that intro top part. I think maybe Romeo can kind of read. No, no, no.  No, no, no.

26:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  This is missing, Rao, from your sketch that we showed us. You have the state after deployed. But you didn't have any way where we can see the control, the form.  That's what I didn't understand. So that's what I'm trying to show you. And in the current system, so we implemented the controls.  This looks like this. So it's the old way, blah, blah. And you can see the form. You saw that me approve and deployed.  And then I deployed similar to policy. And now that I deployed it, I can see here all my requests in this table.  It's not pretty, but this is it. These two pages are basically what you are trying to build there in single page and that's better just so you know that you already have it in this one.

26:41 - A L
  I'm just wondering if it can be even like because this is the governance one, right? So a lot of the governance ones.  So almost like this just needs to be updated, which I think it like to the current design, you know, with the colors and the bars on top, like the policy management, guess.  And then if you click on the next one, bio, then and then so the description should be updated. Then I did  That little guy on top, I guess would be like, you know, be like, this is a conflict of, know, that little pink thing that we have on top of the policies one, like, you know, you have that little guy.  So ideally on the right, you have that approval thing like you do on policies of when this form was actually approved and stuff.  So I don't know maybe it might be just faster either for Romeo to to kind of work off of this existing template that we have.  So it's just like optimizing it so that it looks like the policy one. Do you know what I mean?  So the design for this page for controls is already done.

27:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, basically. So there's just nothing to save there.

27:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  The aspect of introducing an explanation.

27:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure, we can create like a header, but this is mostly a content thing, not a design thing. Because the header is like a component, I suppose the development team just changes the text of the header, which means that we need the text content.  I think as a subject matter expert we need your help on this, like explaining why this is matter. Yeah, it's fine.

28:05 - A L
  Yeah, I can put in the text, it's more that I don't know even if you can just take what has been done.

28:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  So my point, I didn't want to go into any complexities with this. My point was that this page here, throughout that you're building, sorry, this one here, basically this is the page that we are trying to replace this page here, right?

28:26 - A L
  So when you click on it, yes, I know.

28:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Now, it's just an obstruction. Go ahead. Yeah, but the idea is to try to replace our right boating because this is where I see the details.  don't have much here. It's just it was like done quickly and just to have it. But if you want to see the requests, you have to go here and you have to see all the requests.  what I'm trying to just to show you is this is what we have. And if it will help you maybe understand what what needs to be done.  maybe this can help you, you can access it here and you can also call me. But basically, just trying to say that this here is good.  As far as I'm concerned, it looks good. It's just a question of how that part is missing. If you already went through, I won't go over it.  I don't want to go over that again. It's fine. I just want to tell you that we have this implemented so that you know that this is done and how it looks like.  It's not pretty and it needs some work.

29:25 - A L
  Maybe we don't even need to have that middle page for now because we have the deployment. We want to really simplify this to get the MVP out.  Couldn't we just update this page to match Romeo's when you click on it? this one is done. Yeah, this one is done.  is this year.

29:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, exactly.

29:44 - A L
  Okay, then you have Welcome to and then take that little pink guy that was there in that in that figma that you had or something.  Yeah, this guy and throw him on top of that questionnaire with directions on this is how you deploy. Oh, Something like this, shall made, maybe.

30:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  Or if you're something like this, probably, yeah, or this, yeah, yeah, it looks like that. Like, but then with the forms in it, like it looks exactly like that.

30:16 - A L
  So maybe the Romeo or maybe he doesn't too, because you could just copy copy this. then I would I would prefer to have it.

30:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  would not the part, but I would prefer to have the layout part, you know, just so that we have it, it's much better to work that way.

30:30 - A L
  Because could like a Romeo, just like create something like this, but for the controls, like these questionnaires.

30:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then then you can approve and deploy or whatever.

30:40 - A L
  And then the next one missing is kind of like, yeah, the follow up to do and whether or not in the MVP version, we just create that like, yeah, that most recent.  This is it here. Yeah, this is it here and then you see that you filter it like that from them.  I don't know, but I'm just trying to think. Then we would go faster, right? Because we have a lot of the components already in here and it's kind of following the policy flow.  Just in terms of like, yeah. Yeah, we don't hear on this page.

31:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it's it's it's a bit different I like the suggestion honestly, so I'm not sure which direction should we go, but it's probably quicker a bit.  Well, maybe maybe you and I can sync in and talk about how we can solve this if you want you can call me and then we can just sync and see if this is faster or not in the end.  I feel like if we had this, it's not perfect.

31:30 - A L
  At least it would start working and people can see it and the design is already a lot nicer how Romeo did it and how the policy pages.  But of course, I was more sense, but it's like if that's going to take a week or something to develop that and this is only going to take, you know, probably more than a week.

31:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  Probably other changes because we have that some things we are creating it from existing part. So it's not like we are building and in new, but there are some changes that we will have to do.  And this one is already implemented. We will just need to bug fix it and change the design. it is easier on the development side right now to get it out that's I think how much faster would one be like it would this be like a couple of days I don't know I don't have no no no this is probably also a week or two or of the redesign depending on what changes we need to do here if they're simple then it's a week or for us to do it but I need to see the changes for example this page here to redesign it's probably a day or even a less maybe I have to check with the guys but I want to see this page how it looks how it needs to look like that that'd be a priority for Romeo then just so we could also like for Romeo maybe before like Thursday or for Thursday or Friday just to redesign that paper shouldn't take too long because maybe we can start with that yeah and just continue this what you're doing we can continue maybe that after after the initial release and then work on the improvement and get this out as soon as possible as I said maybe we can sync it out and try to compare and see if it makes sense because to be honest I would I don't like that every page looks the same in our app but for them repeat might be just  the better way or quicker way to get out and start onboarding customers. Yeah, but is it possible for Romeo?

33:09 - A L
  can you just make, can we add that as a task? a fast one is just like take the existing one that we have here or just like existing form and copy it into the policy management style.  Xiao, is that okay too? right. I think so.

33:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure, yeah. I'll write the card on it. Because I think that could be one that could go quickly also.

33:37 - A L
  And then we can see how quickly it would be to just update all, like yeah, cause we have all the forms ready from my understanding, right?  Yvonne, you have the new forms with the new content. think we gave that to you. Okay, so. I'm not sure.

33:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  don't think actually, I don't know to be honest. It's somewhere, it's not in here.

33:56 - A L
  So like we already have all the forms ready. And then if we have, if we have... the new design from Romeo already, then it's like just updating those basic ones, then we would have control G side ready, not the E side, which is what we're working with Val on now.  that could help just speed things up too in that.

34:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  if you need help with this, maybe we can go to the current controls from how it's supposed to work currently, and how it should work in the app because it's built.  Or maybe they can help for the MVP part. We will have to do some additional things. it's not like this will make us faster for the current thing, but we don't have carbon reporting in.  We'll have to build custom stuff for that, and probably for that other controls I forgot the name of, but there are, I think, two or three custom controls that are different from the others.  So the thing I showed is just for the standard control, which gets formed and is deployed and that's done.  But other than that, we don't have anything else. So we'll have to build it for, for example, carbon reporting.

35:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so yes, we can add that header on top of the form for controls, and me and Ivan will discuss a little bit other details.  Okay.

35:22 - A L
  Yeah. Sounds good. Okay.

35:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  good. Okay.

35:26 - A L
  Then we'll be in touch then.

35:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Abby, can we have our next call in 4.30? I need to launch, I need to release some things, then we'll see you, Ra.

35:37 - A L
  Yeah, thank you. Okay, see you.

35:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thanks.

35:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  Bye.
