  Hello, Chewie.

0:01 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Where are you?

0:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  me find the point.

0:03 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Have you got my, yeah. You see me?

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I see you. I see you.

0:09 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Do you see me?

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I can.

0:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  can. It's just sometimes the settings set myself to, I'm just going to pin you so I can only see you and I can't see me.  There we go. Good.

0:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I need to use more of those functions. I'm just opening my notes and putting them next to our window.  Nice. So I was checking. It's been a while since the last time we spoke. Time really does fly. know it's a bit of a cliche, but it's true.

0:38 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, it does. So over in Europe at the moment, Chewie?

0:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. I'm in Portugal now. I am from Portugal. Ah, OK. So I am in Portugal now. I'll be for the holidays and a little bit more.  And then I'll go back to Brazil. So right now we are probably in the same time zone. Yes, we are.

1:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  tree here.

1:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, where in Portugal are you? So near Porto, Matuzinho is on the beach, the beach of Porto.

1:09 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, excellent, good, nice spot on the Porto. So yeah, nice.

1:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and it's good, we've been trying out this longer stays here, because we were doing the visit for the holidays kind of thing, which it's good that we can do it.  But now we've been trying to spend, you know, bigger chunks of time here. And in a way, it's also why we've, me and my wife organize our life in the way we have.  So it's good to be able to, you know, put that flexibility to use, right? So it's, that's where we are right now.

1:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I guess you must be, you don't have kids yet, do you?

1:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't, I don't. And we know that the moment we have kids, this flexibility rule. Yeah.

2:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  yeah I just think it depends on where you want to be ultimately but when you start having kids then you decide where you i don't know is it a choice that you would come to portugal or you always be in brazil we've been thinking about uh raising them in portugal right having them in brazil yeah but raising them in portugal well okay okay nice minor all grown up i'm now a grandfather i think maybe i've become a grandfather since i spoke to you oh yeah yeah was it what when did we chat i've said my granddaughter was born in may so uh say it says here it was on october i'm not entirely sure maybe i wrote the dates wrong but i don't know it was in i'll tell you when we spoke uh uh it was october it was uh  Wow.

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

3:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I don't know what that means.

3:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, of the same mind, I thought like it had been longer.

3:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so maybe we took, we both took such a lot away from it that it feels like we've known each other for a long time.  Yeah, maybe, maybe.

3:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe that's it. I've made so many notes. mean, I'm struggling not to just keep looking at them. I've made a lot of notes.  We went into so many, many places. Oh, from our last conversation.

3:32 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes. How is it all going?

3:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  On my side, so good things and bad, not bad things, but less good things. So good things is, I think the more conversations I have, the more I notice that, you know, people understand what I'm talking about.  They resonate with it. Another thing that it's, I think it's good, it was not planned is so many conversations,  And I don't look for conversations in that way. They just seem to happen in that way. But oftentimes, at some point, people comment on the tension between being very curious and really knowledgeable.  And how difficult it is to put that into products, because they just keep chasing the next thing.

4:25 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And you've mentioned this. You've mentioned this.

4:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was checking this. And it's so interesting, because I also suffer with that. it's kind of a pattern. For some reason, I think it makes sense.  But for some reason, very curious people, love having these conversations, are always up for a chat. I mean, I have a great time.  And I'm thinking, is this a characteristic of my ACP? I don't know. Maybe it is, because yeah. Yeah.

4:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So yeah, maybe you're right. actually is a characteristic. So from my Briggs, I'm an ENTP, which apparently is a characteristic, but also I've been digging into sort of new business models.  the problem I'm having is that the art of the possible keeps on changing because of the rate of change in technology particularly, or the rate at which you discover new things.  You get to the brow of a hill and you discover a whole new thing. So there's an element of curiosity, but if you started building before you had that view, you'd be building a whole new thing.  But at some point you need to start building and testing. So I think in terms of innovation and new ideas, that's why it's so important to focus on the problem and the solution.  focus on the problem, you become richer in your knowledge about what the customer problem is, and as you learn more things, you're in new ways to solve that problem.  that's hence that focus. think you're connected to Nick Kimovich.

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  are are you friendly with him yeah um yeah i've i've spoken to him a few times on calls and recently i know he's making like a big youtube push so he's had no calls until i drew my youtube thing and i go i just send him a message like um i'll keep on keep on keep it on because it's it's a lot of work the videos he makes yeah but i like him i like him yeah he's very good he's good funnily enough the last person i was talking to today is on a big youtube push as well so maybe we should be doing a youtube push because so yeah so so okay so i asked so where did we get to in terms of how things are going so some things give some what's what's what's gone well and what what what what have you struggled with i think the the gone well is the clarity and uh signals from from the market that there's something in here right and uh not so  Well, I guess it's my speed at converting that into paid products. mean, that process of having interesting conversations, figuring out how we can collaborate and eventually turning that into a paid thing, it happens.  It's not, of course, there's like a conversion rate to it. Yeah. But also, I think there's two aspects of it.  One of them is it can be a of a long time. And there's also another aspect that for me, very personally, it's difficult because I I'll be exposing my neck here, but I think it's, I might just do it.  The thing is that when I have these conversations, such as the one we had and when we're having, oftentimes I really get into like a personal appreciation of the person and I feel bad about charging and then I like undercharge and stuff like that.  Yes. I think I feel so seen in some of these conversations because one of my formative experiences is like people don't get what I'm saying.  is a very common and from your reaction it seems maybe for you as well. And sometimes you find like people that you know get you, they don't need to explain the whole thing, they get the references and in my mind I'm like okay so this is a friend now right and then I have like this whole psychology of money thing around Parisian friends and I think it's just you know holding your back.

8:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  But it's a thing, it's a real thing. I know exactly where you are with this because I have the same problem in the sense that I talk to people and depending on what first it's about definition of what is your product, what are you selling to people.  During the course of conversations so because my background is recruitment I have a lot of people who kind of approach me because they're ultimately the trigger for them as they're looking for work.  So they talk to me, don't give long conversations, and I kind of guide them to resources. You know, I find at the end of the conversation that I've given them a whole load of stuff, or not just that, but just in terms of their job, how to figure out how to solve this or where to look for that.  And it's been a great conversation, but I've got nothing that I can charge anybody for because I'm not going to find them a job.  Or even if they become a customer, then I have conversations with them, I guide them to content to help them do their job, but I can't charge them for that.  So I know exactly how you feel. yet it's not something that's tangible in the sense of productize what I've got.  I'm not a coach, although I could possibly, you know, everybody's presenting themselves as a coach. So I mean, from your perspective, you have got a product to some extent, have you not in the sense that you can take IP?  and turn it into a workshop which is a product for your customer and so there's a beginning and an endpoint where they created the product for themselves.

10:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah and it's really a case of the cobalt sun kind of thing. So a couple of thoughts on this.  yes I think it's relatively clear the way forward and I mean it's I still struggle with a shiny object and getting sidetracked with oh there's a new algorithm whatever you need to focus on you know stuff like this and I've been you know also the usual productivity advice I don't think it works for our kind of minds so we need to figure out our own productivity tool set that's a whole different thing.

10:50 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  What does that mean? What do you mean?

10:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's very curious people and they just enjoy getting lost in new issues and new themes. think they really struggle or I really struggle and I identify in this way with not just knowing what it needs to be done because oftentimes you know what needs to be done but just taming that desire of oh I need to learn about this other thing right and it just go on I know now it's perplexity but used to be I don't know wikipedia and it's like oh I really want to know just then about this thing and you know there's thing you should be doing and that you're not doing and I I think a lot of advice around this is based on you know people that they lack clarity of what to do but once they know they just do it and I I don't think that's my problem yeah sometimes people say that our action is better than that you know you've been taking action and being wrong I think the question is because you are formulating your business is going to be until you've done that it's difficult to take action so a lot

12:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  but you're probably stuck in a process place where you are doing a lot of analysis and discovery and finding new things and that changes the terrain in terms of what you then might want to be delivering.  So this is the sort of thing I suspect that Nick can help you with because he will make it tangible in the sense that if this is your business model, you know, what is it that you, what's the problem you're trying to solve and what proof points do you have?  What have you got from your customers or potential customers? Because that will create your alignment. We shall then give you your, your tasks should be aligned with achieving the goal of delivering that business model.  if you have proven the model, i.e. proven the need, then it makes sense to do that. If you haven't proven the need, then you shouldn't be executing.

12:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, I think what I've come to realize is that a lot of times this is not so much a  lack of information, it's just the kind of social environment, social context that unlocks you, right? So you can read about anything online, especially now with AI and help you find the stuff, but then you have those things like, oh, I've promised somebody that I would do something or, like, I never delay things for clients or customers.  They always get things on time and on good quality. But anyway, I mean, this is kind of another thing.  So when I said the not as good thing is just the frustration of, you know, dealing with this aspect of me that has not fully changed.  It's much better, but it's still kind of there.

13:44 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Sorry, Karim.

13:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, and I was thinking about you, you said, you've mentioned that as you climb up the expertise mountain, you see other vistas, and then you're like, oh, I want to learn that thing now.  And just yesterday, you know writing for myself a post on I Used to I used to really like that I like Landscape analogy, so the map and the territory the mountain.  I love that stuff spatial stuff and Then another one that came to me was the idea of you know old maps navigation maps here be dragons sort of thing Because whenever those guys put a dragon or a sea monster somewhere It didn't mean that we would never go there.  Just let's not go there right now There's dragons here And this is a little bit of encryption right because these maps are really valuable so they would just you know trick the opponents and I've been thinking about that about that idea of Just at some point when you find oh, I'm advancing towards something new but that thing that's really interesting I'll just place a here be dragon sign  go back to, you know, finding the way in their Africa or something like that.

15:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Something you might find, well I think I'm going to find useful, a couple of things. One is, whilst I started journaling, basically writing stuff down, writing my day down, and writing down what I'm thinking, because that meant that I could just basically, I could find things quite quickly.  I didn't have to go and put it somewhere. It was all in this one journal, so I've been doing that.  But what I've also done is I've discovered a new tool called Motion.

15:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Motion? Motion.

15:43 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's like a task, it's like a calendar and task management tool, but it's AI powered. So it's just Asana.  Yeah, and Monday.com. I've used Asana, but I always find For me, it just became like a data repository. I wasn't really using it for task management.  I wasn't moving anything forward. motion seems really interesting because you can capture your ideas for what needs to be done tasks, but you can turn them into projects and then you can have Gantt views, you know, you can timeline things.  And if something changes in your schedule, it'll reorganize everything for you.

16:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you found it? I'm looking at the website. Interesting. So for you, the biggest advantage of using motion, was it?

16:45 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Organizing tasks. sometimes I, in terms of my personal productivity, I got lots of things kind of going on and most of it's going on in my head.

16:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so,

17:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Sometimes I get overwhelmed with, and I don't know which thing to start with. And so I spend as much of the day trying to think what I've got to do as I do doing it.  And so with and also when I try and do something, I need I kind of need to load my head up with the resources that I need to use to do it.  So it might be data or information or whatever it happens to be. So I need to quickly get to things.  So I get to Google Sheets and I use Google Docs and things. But I think with if you can work it around the tasks, and if those tasks are organized around projects or themes, then that should keep you more focused.  And so what I'm doing is I'm setting myself deadlines to achieve things by because otherwise I can go from these huge tangents, kind of forget what I've decided already I need to do, go around the house, just go in the huge tension, work it all out.  And I end up back where I started. I've got nine nine exhausted because it's been over here. So, I need to capture that.  I think that the thinking is good and the investigating is good, but it takes energy and it distracts you from actually getting things done.  So, for me, for example, and I'll tell you how I got to this, but I need to talk to some customers, because I need to validate something that I think is a model at the moment.  So, and my tendency is to go in and polish the solution. think of other ways or I find myself mapping out the solution in a different way or looking for validation from people for it.  And at the end of the day, I know that the validation can never come from the customer. needs to come from in their terms.  I'm exploring something at the moment, which to some extent is around. I kind of think what I was talking to you, it's clear to me.  What I've discovered, I think we got to this point, that people who consultants very often end up engaging with a customer, the first thing they do is they engage with a workshop, very often they don't actually have workshops, and so they don't really market the fact that they do workshops, it's just what they end up doing.  But if you try to find the people who do these workshops, you won't find them because they're not marketing, they're not articulating what they do, and it's not repeatable, so it's not scalable.  So I was thinking, okay, so how do, when you imagine a corporate customer, knowledge is now commodity and execution is commodity, so these two things are, you you can buy that in from anybody.  The bit in the middle is a workshop, and within the workshop scale there are two elements, one is expertise and the other one is facilitation.  And sometimes people are experts that can do a bit of facilitation. very very good facilitators but they have no expertise.  Each work given a different sort of client situation. So if a client has a problem, how do they find the person, well first maybe the workshop that will help them solve that problem.  So it might be purely a facilitation, it might be a design sprint that they the people. And in which case you just take a facilitator to do that.  Or it may be that you need some insight in terms of you might decide okay we as a team need to talk about what we're going to do about AI.  You need somebody in the room who understands what the possibilities are as far as AI is concerned. Otherwise you would just imagine things.  that's a level of expertise. where I got to, I don't know whether I mentioned this to you, but where I got to all of this is that ultimately what you need is sense making.  You need a sense maker who can work with you to bring their knowledge into your context and then work with you through a process to help you make decisions in your context.  what should our strategy be? Why are we helping to work together, why are these people falling out, how do we innovate, what are we going to do about AI, all of that.  So then the question is, how do I find people who can help me do this, which workshops I need to solve, what types of problems, and then which people can help me deliver these workshops?  And if you're online, it's very difficult to find these people.

21:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I really like that kind of spectrum. You just described subject matter expertise and facilitation skills at the other end.  really useful. It just brings true. And I agree it's usually not very legible from the outside, especially the people that have more subject matter expertise.  Because I think if you look for facilitators, they're telling the world that they are facilitators. Yes, but subject matter experts.  often don't know about facilitation and if they know they don't put it front and center it's just part of their toolkit I guess yes and I also think that I think I think now this makes sense because I was checking and last time you said oh I'm working on something I'm not ready to share it yet and I suspect this was it and yeah I think I think there's also an aspect which is difficult because if you are a consultant and you want to learn facilitation right now I think most of your options are around like schools for facilitators and they have this facilitation vibe you know the funny classes the colorful shirts and that kind of thing are you thinking about agent smart here yeah then and you know it's kind of yeah I like them I like their stuff yeah but it's it's kind of  a bingo card of are you a facilitator do you have a shirt that has geometric patterns you know so and I think for a lot of people they get put off like this childish thing which is I think it's really important really works is is a fictional aspect of facilitation is to know get people but I think some people don't take it seriously because of that and then they get a bit stuck because they will need to translate the modeling clay spaghetti bridge you know Lego facilitation aspects into serious business and they they they get stuck there I mean the people that can do that translation they would probably already be good facilitators regardless right so I feel there's attention there but I'm not sure I've been thinking about you know  That's kind of the angle. One of the angles I tried to use on my newsletter, like, not talking about workshops from the facilitation aspect, but more from, like, as a product.  And I agree with your observation. think this is not very legible from the outside. Like, you know a guy.  Maybe you know a guy and you've done work with this guy. It's under the time constraints of like, there's an RFP to respond.

24:34 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, it's also knowing which problems are solved through what methodology or framework. there's mapping frameworks to types of problems, the process that you can take a team of people through.  And there's people maybe have their own IP that solve problems but haven't productise it, which is the area that you help  But finding these people, because I find myself recommending people all the time, know, people need insight or knowledge, and, you know, once I understand what their situation is, I can normally really offer this to people that they should look at, and I think the same is true for, you know, if this is a problem that you have within your organiser, if your board is dysfunctional for these reasons, this is the kind of support that you need to resolve that.  This is somebody that could solve that problem for you. you wouldn't necessarily know that. They're not somebody that you can find easily.  I know it, because I look at the market and I look at people a lot, so I know who these people are.  But they're not recognisable by their profile.

25:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This just came to me, but I suspect this was already a new radar. So recently, I did a those assessments that you do figure out what kind of workshopper you are.  I did one of those from a competitor and it was it was made with tally no proprietary tools just really quickly and I think at the end there were like four possible alternatives and mine my result I I answered like truthfully my own result was I'm a framework kind of workshopper I'm not for instance as opposed to a you know creative unlocking team building workshopper so I thought that was really interesting because his market I think is our facilitators so it's you want to see yourself in assessment but because you have this network of experts right like just you creating some sort of tool that stays  is between them and the facilitator. It's like, what kind of problem are you solving? And then eventually, because you have the database, right?  You should talk to Claire. Claire is the right person for that.

27:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So, yeah. So what I'm looking at is how to engage customers in a dialogue around what their problem is.  Diagnose that problem to the extent that we can make recommendations as to who can solve that problem for them.  The chances are, either I create a marketplace or what I need to do, first of all, is establish whether I can sell workshops.  And so what I'm honing in on is workshops around, what do we do about AI? And I've been on some workshops and training and demonstrated training courses in this area as well.  Having said all of that, where I got to, in terms of when I was thinking, OK, fine. It's workshops, facilitation, it's a marketplace.  Then I started thinking, OK, so how does this look in three years' time? And obviously, there's going to be a big component of AI.  So then I started thinking, OK, well, in that case, AI is probably going to end up doing the facilitation of workshops.  If you imagine the AI in the room, AI can guide the workshop, listen to the responses, guide the workshop to get the best out of people and help them reach a conclusion, as well as document everything that's been agreed, who contributed to it, how much buy-in there was, what we need to do afterwards, plus all the prep, who's going to be there, what do they know, what's the level of understanding and knowledge.  AI in the room. So then I thought, that's something that we need to build. When I was talking to a senior level candidate who contacted me, he was the global head of emerging technology and AI for a large advertising agency, I sort of found  it off and she was really excited by it. Now she's going to do some side hustle working with me on this stuff.  Having said that, I'm getting to think there's no point in going with the AI, but by the time we figured out how to do it with AI, AI has moved on to such an extent that you're going to be, you know, I need to get back to the customer problem and how we solve that problem.  And the other thing, the other interesting insight is Jeff Bezos saying, was it Jeff Bezos? Yeah, I think it was Jeff Bezos saying if you can do it with the, somebody said, I can't remember who it was now, but basically if you can do something with the existing resources, don't use the technology to do it.  So for example, at the moment we have an abundance of people who can deliver these workshops. And so the preference from a customer perspective is not going to be to use AI.  It'll be to use the right people rather than rather than replace them.

30:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That makes sense.

30:06 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, yes.

30:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, I think. No, but I suspect that as the cost of AI, you know, goes down, I've thought a lot about, you know, AI, because sometimes keeps keeps me up at night.  And the only way I can see right now, and then the analogy I have, and I've written about this on the weird part of my work, is I think it's a little bit like having a horse.  Like if you have a horse right now, you are a rich person with a rich hobby.

30:42 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

30:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And with an expensive hobby. And I think that as AI, know, substitutes people and everything working with real people, it becomes like a little accessory thing to do.  Yeah, I don't I don't see You know other ways, maybe I'm being short-sighted, but there's like I can give an example There's a company They are based in New York, but they were founded by Brazilians Maybe you heard of them.  They're named Mesa M-E-S-A Mesa Mesa, yeah, okay Mesa.co I think Co and what they do really are design springs, okay?  They do design, but they never say design springs, right? They never mentioned this. They create their own category and the thing is they They put together a Mesa is a table.  That's the meaning of the word, right? they put together mesas. They don't call it workshops. We put together a Mesa For a week in a cool venue with cool experts, right?  So whenever they talk about their case studies They will mention, we've brought like from all over the world. So we brought like the foremost  especially on car entertainment systems from Toyota and we brought the Brown James. know, they make these weird mixes. And I think they're all, their whole angle is, it's really cool to hire them, you know?  And I think they're really expensive and they give you a lot of cool stuff to use on your, you know, comms.  Cause the thing is nice. have some famous intellectuals, know?

32:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

32:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think they mix like workshops, fine dining and exclusive access to exclusive people. And they've been doing this for like 10 or 12 years.  And I think that's so clever because this is impervious to AI. The more AI you have, the more it is available.  And I think there's something in there. I don't know.

32:48 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, that's kind of event community, isn't it, with a purpose?

32:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Kind of, but I think that the difference, the place where it connects with your world is that they select the experts that will present.

33:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  participate right you cannot join in they say oh we need a guy that's really good at this and then you get invited and I'm sure like the whole experience of receiving the invitations also cool I'm pretty sure of that so yeah basically that's that's interesting so there's do you know strategizer Alexander Ostervalder yeah yeah so they are changing their business model so they're so they charge an ongoing recurring revenue subscription to that is ten thousand dollars or ten thousand euros per team and it's facilitated by somebody in that team so it's an internal facilitator and it doesn't sound like they have to be a particular a proper facilitated but somebody that will be there to kind of coordinate do work through the process but it's augmented by AI so increasingly AI will guide people through in a way that a facilitator would  even doing the work, the AI guiding them through the process and the outcome is that they've made decisions around whatever their goal is around innovation.  So these are the tasks we need to do. This is what we need to think about. We've captured our pain gains and jobs to be done.  Now we're going to, you know, it'll take you through that process. The stuff that Nick does, Nick Himovitz, so I mean, that's an example of AI.  thing is that he, they own the IP.

34:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so it's fabulous.

34:36 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I think they will do very, very well. And I think also because of the rate of change, the need to reinvent is a shortening period because things are really so quickly.  Innovation becomes more and more important and corporate will look to people like a strategizer. They don't want to start consulting.  What they want to do is sell recurring revenues. So I think it's a fantastic.

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  model what they're doing yeah I think yeah last time you've mentioned something about a survey on your survey from your your database of people asking them some questions that you could put into a model and figure out like what they're about and they remember yeah yeah that this should be like the initial dialogue around the problem that they're having yeah because the way I see it is either you have access I don't know it's just thinking about the top of my head if you have access to data that other  like a black box that you put something in and you spit something out and that's useful. And it seems to me that this is a bit like the best time to plant a tree was 40 years ago, the second best time is now.  Do you know, it's the second time, somebody said that to me earlier on today. Yeah.

36:17 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, yeah. It's not funny. I think a lot of us are thinking about that in regards to data.

36:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so there's that aspect of probably strategizer as a lot of, you know, a firsthand experience with patterns and they can just, you know, use it.  But on the other hand, if you don't have that, I think, which is my case, I think I need to lean harder into the experience aspect, not the, not the proprietary information aspect is more like the proprietary experience aspect.  So for me, what I what I think about is a lot along the lines of of, you know, Mesa and that kind of vibe.  And yeah, I don't know, there's, well, who's your customer? So what I'm realizing now is that there's two sets of people.  set of people is people that I, it's easy for me to have conversations with, but I'm not sure if they would be the best customer, but they seem to, you know, understand the work and sometimes value it enough to pay for it, which is like our like solo experts or experts with very small, yes.  I love the social aspect of it, but I think it's a difficult market because every dollar is really like, they really want to think about it and so on.  And then I think it'd be, know, I suspect, because I haven't been able to, you know, reach these people so well.  I suspect is, it is responsible people. responsible for growth or revenue that are finding that whatever they're selling is hitting a wall and they might need to do something about the product.  And I think the second group is more willing to spend money but it's not been so easy for me to reach them.  It's also Well, it's easier for me to find correspond online because they hang out where I hang out. These guys don't hang out where I hang out, right?  So I think that's it. But ideally, basically that's the direction I want to move into. Ideally, I think it's like boutique firms, not too big, but not solos.  Right.

38:47 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. So a boutique firm with a growth person. Yeah.

38:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

38:53 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. And therefore, your marketing becomes messaging around the value of having workshops in a repeatable way and therefore this is what you can help them do, so you could deliver that for them.  Okay, all right. Have we talked about this? Do you know Joe Mahoney?

39:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I follow him, yeah. send him a couple of messages, so he's very kind.

39:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, he's a decent guy, but he will have, in terms of the people that will have access to your target audience.  There's Joe Mahoney, Luke Smayers, do you know Luke Smayers? I follow him, yeah. looking for him. And a guy called Nick Sinnet, S-Y-N-O-T-T.

39:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nick, I don't know Nick.

39:43 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  He has a marketing agency called Gage, but he helps BT consulting firms go to market.

39:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could you find him? You found him, okay. Yeah. So between those three...

40:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  people they will they they they are dealing with the people that you would want to target.

40:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you thank you for suggesting the names.

40:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So in terms of your product as a package what's the what in the sense of what's the what's what's the process time frames and price?

40:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right now I'm doing it in four sessions for 90 minute sessions. Yeah and and the price I've been aiming at I didn't get there yet it's $5,000.

40:49 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  $5,000 four and half okay four times 90 minutes and what's the outcome?

40:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you get a workshop package which is a mirror boards and facilitation. right? That helps you manage the thing and the script for the workshop.  So if you need to adjust things and timings and stuff. So the boards are the artifacts that you use.  The script is the tasks and the times you have and so on. the facilitation guide is more how you do the tasks within the script.

41:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, okay. So you take their content and you design a workshop that they can execute using a mayor board.  I think it's funny. I went on a AI design sprint. It was a pasted session with it. And I was interested.  It seems, it depends on the reason why you want why you want the workshop in the first place, but it seemed a bit archaic to me.  And it seemed that the decision So the other question is in terms of the whether you because at the moment you're hoping people take their IP and turn it into workshops what about creating your own workshops and selling them?

43:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect so the workshop I have I have a few in on the stove which I think is a familiar feeling perhaps but there's three on the stove so the first one is a workshop to invent visual frameworks that talk about your method so basically the output is images or schematics that you can use to explain what you do to others.  Right okay this is more about creating very simple very memetic visual archetypes like oh the pyramid of whatever stuff like this yeah and  And this one I have run, but I'm polishing it to be more standalone, if I can.

44:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  With an outcome like that, is that not something that you need an average of input in order to do that?  presumably they talk about it by into the idea that you could create it, do you?

44:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we do it together. So basically we are on a mirror and after a certain point I bring in my pen and we are discussing on mirror and me drawing things in real time.  Okay. And so that's one. There's another one which is more fleshed out. It's like on version 3, but I didn't finish version 3.  So version 2 is complete, version 3 is not complete. Which is about finding content ideas for your expertise if you struggle with the whole algorithmic stuff.  This one I've tested more extensively, what I've noticed is that lots of people have really interesting things to say, but they get discouraged by the unfairness or the ruthlessness of algorithms.  So they don't say their things they want to say. And then they get stuck in not talking about their own expertise.

45:25 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So they want to talk about their expertise, but they're conflicted because they're trying to pander to the algorithm. So they don't think that what they have to say is going to get that wrong.  Yeah, it's a bit like that.

45:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it was, what's the name? Well, there's a philosopher I don't remember that said something along the lines of, you know, the problem with the world is that those that don't know the answers, or the people that don't know, they act as if they know, should do.  10 things to write about, then if I do 10 things, then I reconceive that what I'm doing. Otherwise, people keep overanalyzing like one unique post that didn't go anywhere.  And the third one that I'm putting together, I already have it, but it's too long. It's a workshop for making workshops.  Yeah. It's quite meta, and people get a little bit confused with meta stuff. And I think it's too long.  I need to make it shorter.

47:37 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So which of these is resonating most with your potential customers, would you say?

47:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think right now is the visual frameworks one. Yeah, but I don't have a control group to know. Yeah.  I've just been talking more about this one. So right now, it gets more.

48:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And so the visual frameworks is presumably they need to have something which is worthwhile or how different they need to be to merit having their own visual framework.  Because obviously, if they're delivering standard stuff, then customers are familiar with the standard stuff and go, I want you to come and do standard stuff for us.  Okay, so if it's new, you know what saying? think I do.

48:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So here's my thinking around this. this visual frameworks, they are, there's two sides of it. One of them is, I think more like internal sense making, like, how do I work?  I don't know how I work. But people never come saying this. They don't notice this.

48:44 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  In the process, they realize, oh, so this is how I work.

48:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is like an internal framework, not necessarily for distribution. Because it's probably too quirky into, you know, flexible. But then you have  You can slice down the way you work into perspectives. I'll talk about the three principles that underpin everything I do, right, and then you create a visual framework for that.  All right, I want to talk about the four client profiles that usually get something out of my products and then you create a framework for that.  The thing is, all of these frameworks, they relate to your work but they are your work from different perspectives.  So, instantly you get a lot of different ways of talking about your work that don't feel like repetition, which is a problem for an ocherist people.  They don't like to repeat themselves. And you also send this stuff into the marketplace of ideas and see which ones connect with people.  So you might think that, oh, people really want to know about my four-steps process to whatever. And then you start talking about that.  But you also talk about your five... of conditions for what not and then you realize oh people really connect much more with the five conditions for what not so it's I think at the end having multiple visual frameworks is a little bit like having yeah you can apply the scientific method to your ideas because you have something to send in to people and get you know their their feedback on yeah I think that's I mean I can nerd out strong on on the visual framework thing but this is basically the the gist of it so would you show that is that your strongest area of capability the visual frameworks it might be yeah I think so because I've done I've done both consulting I've done visual facilitation and I've done workshop facilitation all of these things so the visual the visual frameworks is really I think it's really easy for me  Because I used to do it live while people are talking stuff like that. And I have a good repertoire of those things.  And they are, by their own nature, again, memetic, that they're going out into the world and people see them.  A workshop is better than just talking about what you know, because you can get pictures and campuses and stuff like that.  But still, it's more complex than a visual framework. I think the visual framework is probably the sweet spot of giving wings to ideas.

51:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, I suppose it's a way of articulating. also, in terms of, presumably, could form the basis of a workshop with a customer.

51:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

51:45 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  There's a guy called Andy, something I don't know his name is now, but he talks about, I think he does something similar where he helps people basically create a  framework around their IP he's he's I need to find this guy yeah early no but I remember I'll remember his name he comes up a lot but he's a sort of public speaker he used to work in recruitment which is how I know him but he I've seen he does a sort of YouTube quick advert thing and it's about basically what you do because you know the death by PowerPoint scenario if you replace that of the framework yeah then you discuss the framework and you can hurt you can be there as a discussion point it's a two-way thing so and you're creating a unique piece of IP that's that's your thing so your visual identity you're your IP so when I remember his name I'll send you a link I'm itching literally he's obviously made he's made made that work having said all of that  I would have a play around with ChatGPT and see if you fed ChatGPT with a description, it would come up with the framework for you fairly simply, I would imagine.

53:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so, yes, I think so and I've tried this in the past by asking it to output into Mermaid.js and it kind of gets it.  I think there are some aspects of this that I feel a little bit safer. One of them is, so I'll describe a recent situation, I was talking to someone about this thing and I think Professor Luk Smears talks about this like the unique perspective, Sean Johnson also talks about this, you need your own perspective.  realize that your own perspective is, you know, really intertwined with who you are, right? There's like a really personal, almost spiritual aspect to this.  And I've, yeah, I've done training for coaching, but I don't see myself so much as a coach. But, you know, those tools are relatively accessible to me.  And I've noticed that those are the tools that really helped me in that, because when you're asking somebody, how do you work?  Because they want to convert that into a framework. And why does this step matter? Why do you add this step?  Why, why, why this criteria? And then you start realizing, oh, okay, so this person has a certain worldview, right?  And I think that aspect, that dialogue, you could do it with ChatchAPT for sure. It's really good, really smart, especially the paid versions.  But if you do it, and I actually have another one from another client is an extensive user of ChatchAPT, like, he does it while we were talking.  And the thing is, Jechebini never says, I don't know, right? He always spits out something.

55:06 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Right, OK.

55:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And at some point, this affects your ability of trusting him. You can just say anything. It's a great bullshitter, right?  doesn't solve the conviction problem. It tells you something. It gives you an output. But you're not sure that the obstacle is the way, right?  So you're not sure that you can trust that thing. And I think that the advantage of doing that with someone else, with a real person, is that it increases the conviction that, OK, this is something I could use.  Because you could just spend the whole afternoon turning your expertise into frameworks from your chat GPT. And at the end, for some reason, I feel super confident on that.  So what I think is a relevant question, for sure. Yeah, maybe I'm just being. delusional and hopeful?

56:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well I don't think you've been delusional and hopeful but you've got you need to go the other thing is it's one transaction so you have somebody in the pay you five thousand dollars and that's one hit yep and you're in an environment where ultimately chat GPT will do that so you're not going to be able to build a scalable business I agree I agree I think I think there's different end games right so like I said I agree I think you're reading of the scenario I agree with that just today I was reading and highlighting I actually printed a blog post which I don't often do from a fellow Brit his name is Liam

57:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, and he has a post on how April Dunford, famous for the positioning stuff, how she became like a reference in that world, like a thought leader in that world, right?  Yeah. It's a really, let me see, maybe I have it here, because I was just checking it out this morning, and it's really good.  And the end game for her is that she has a business of one, that's her, and she runs workshops and they're really expensive, like $80,000, and yeah, she's a keynote speaker and she does workshops and she charges a lot for them, and that's enough, you know, and for me, when I think about, like, the end game of this, I kind of think that's the sort of end  you know, just being a well-paid expert. Where's the chat? So, here. Okay. This is the article. Liam Perry.

58:16 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, so this, that links bring the, have you shown this to me before?

58:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. I think it doesn't matter.

58:23 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  doesn't matter. Let me just, there we go. I'm going to you know, I'm going to copy this because always happens.  I finish these meetings with people that puts things in chat and I go, bye, and I click out and I lost it.  So, I'm going to save that. Okay, let's have a look. So, okay. What about, so you can create workshops.  That's your thing. So, rather than of creating workshops for, I'm just thinking about designing and building workshops that the customer wants and then find people to deliver them.

59:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that that's an aspect, especially for larger companies. For instance, I've created workshops for other consulting companies that I create the whole thing, the logic of it, the materials, the assets, the guides.  I just send it to them. We've done this a few times, so there's a lot of shared trust and they run it.  I don't even run it with them. So I think that happens when you have more people and there's another possible angle here which is finding people that  probably use a workshop like individual experts. But my point is individual experts, I think it's it's a timing issue because it's relatively easy to find people on the road to become like a thought leader.  can find people are the way they present themselves. can tell that that's what they're aiming at.

1:00:21 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:00:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But you don't know if you're if you're betting on the right horse. And at the end of the day, they are still kind of be to see sort of the thing if it is an individual expert, right?

1:00:34 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  You were talking about back in the right horse in terms of you finding them as a customer. Yeah.

1:00:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:00:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So you can identify them, reach out to them, and they're interested, but they won't part with any money because they're not earning any money.  So they're difficult to get to commit to the services that you might better help them go to market. Yeah, something like this.

1:00:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think part of that is something that can be improved upon. better sales techniques. can talk better about my work.  can have better, you know, case studies. That's partly possible to improve upon. And the other part, I think, is just, you know, selling.  I've been talking to other, you know, solo experts, stuff like that, about selling to solo experts. And everybody says the same thing.  I mean, we are a terrible, you know, market. We are a great crowd to talk, but we are a terrible market to sell to, right?

1:01:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, it's like selling to startups. They don't have any money.

1:01:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:01:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  There are, I mean, I know the fact that the guy I was talking to earlier on today, I've known for years, he sells training courses for transformation people.  What I have noticed is that a lot of people who it's like, you're selling pants to the gold diggers.  So, so what this guy does is he sells them training courses and how to become good transformation leaders because they're independent  consultants and they want a job they want to land a gig being a transmission leader somewhere so they pay them to train them which is fine they can see all the content he's on you know and whether they get jobs or not at the end of the day I don't really know and I suspect often they don't but this is the aspiration in the same way that AJ and SMART are selling facilitation training to people who want to be facilitators and then they struggle to find work because they're not salespeople it's a self-containing market right because the more facilitators you train the harder you make it for the ones you train and yes and what he's also doing is because he's building a brand is being replaced to go for facilitation they'll go to him and then he'll have his top 1% of facilitators that he will basically break the work out to so I mean a nice model but it's a relatively immature market and so the question then is about reaching  the customer. What we need to do is generate the need from the customer for a workshop to solve whatever problem it is they need to be solved and then match them to the solution.  So from my perspective I need to see whether people struggle to find people to deliver these workshops but also the reason why I asked you about creating workshops is whether or not if we find need whether we can create a product which is a workshop to solve that problem.  And would that be a unique thing in terms of the you know it might be a new way of looking at how taking people through the process of how they how they how they bring AI into the organization.  Maybe the sort of sort of stuff that you design is it something which is unique to you could you capture that and own it would you own the IP?

1:03:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think there's like three different questions so for instance when I And when I design a workshop for somebody else, it's the property, but I'm a cohort author.  it's theirs, but I'm twisted as a cohort author.

1:04:15 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  that's one thing.

1:04:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of capturing what I do with AI or maybe cloning myself into AI, I think that's for sure doable up to a point.  I sure wasn't thinking that.

1:04:31 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  wasn't thinking you can clone yourself with AI. But what I was thinking was, if a customer wanted a workshop to work through, like, for example, the AI design sprint, would you be able to create your own AI design sprint?  Yes. Yeah, there's a couple of reasons.

1:04:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Specifically for that one, because I've been playing around with AI since before chat GPT. And so I understand I think.  enough for for those kind of situations and second is it's a lot about the primitives of the interaction right so primitives are collecting filtering making decisions you know bringing to the surface and then you have different exercises that do this sort of thing yeah but you don't start with the exercise you start with the like the emotional primitives that you want to to use and for instance one of things one of things I've noticed that works really well is ad hoc workshops right or maybe not even workshop maybe maybe just work sessions so this is a real story that you know I've been through I was on a different project and with and I was as a contractor I was not leading the project or anything and we were still in the briefing phase it was you know taking a while the clients I think was not very mature in that market so they didn't really know what they were buying no that kind of thing  And then we understood like there was a lot of anxiety on the part of the client. They weren't sure, were like, I don't know.  So we just set up, instead of selling like a big workshop, that would be either expensive for them or expensive for us to offer for free.  We just made like a one hour session, just figuring out patterns from the beginning of that project. We were not entering the project at the start, we were just jumping in and trying to capture like what went well and they would like to repeat in the project and what didn't go well and they would like to avoid in the project.  And a little bit of what they expected out of the project. And this in terms of technically, this is not a difficult workshop to create.  But the emotional payoff for this prospect that became a client was huge because they felt, you guys get me.  I see the way you think and I see you moving the proceeds.

1:06:54 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And this was not even really a workshop.

1:06:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This was like a work session with maybe three boards. it was not as complex as most people tend to assume and I do think that the real power of workshops is in stuff like that is not in branded workshops but I think most people don't realize this because they've never seen the before and after of a aimless conversation and a conversation with some exercise not a workshop but conversation with a smell of workshop you know the scent of workshop so yeah I mean yeah I don't know if I answered your question but I love like if you open my mirror now there's like more than 20 different things but together for different purposes so there's some patterns yeah but okay so you can build tailor-made workshops build what yeah you but you can build tailor-made workshops to solve a problem and you incorporate certain artifacts to come in and and help with elements what did you call them uh primitive

1:08:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Primitives, we use certain elements, so a workshop is a dynamic work to some extent, you can tailor it to the current situation using primitives or presumably dynamically during the course of the workshop.  So, if you get to a point where you find there's a block or there's something that needs to be addressed more deeply, then you can refine it and bring a primitive in, sort that bit out, discuss it, okay, brilliant, okay.  Okay, and are you familiar with the sort of, all of the, have you been through sort of certifications as far as things like LEGO and the AJ and SMART type stuff, any of those things, you haven't?

1:08:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. I think I should at some point, but I haven't yet, no.

1:08:43 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Right, okay, okay, so, now this is question for you.

1:08:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, obviously, it makes, by you asking the question, you were telling me that this is a question that comes  of when people are hiring for this type of function. The way I've been thinking about it, I'll go ahead, please.

1:09:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's not a question that's come up because people are hiring. So I'm not having conversations with people who are hiring, but I am interested in how I can engage customers who need to bring in workshops and the solution to needing to bring in a workshop is or solve a problem.  So a workshop potentially is a solution to a problem or the beginning of a solution to a problem. Do I help them find people who already do it?  Do I sell standard workshops that people already do, but I basically front it and then I get them to fulfill it?  Or do I create my own workshops? Which is why I was asking you. So we did something together to create a workshop which is driven by the market.  So rather than we do it based on customer need. So what are people asking us? Where do they need help?  What kind of workshop do they actually need? And then we go and design a workshop that satisfies that need and then we go and find the people who facilitate these workshops and say, right, we have these customers who want this workshop and you'd facilitate it for us.

1:10:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the first part is very easy. I think it could be difficult to get facilitators to facilitate other workshops.  mean, I think it's a little bit like herding cats in a sense. So facilitators tend to be very creative and not even from a position of malicious intent or not wanting to do the work, people just think in a different way.  It's like an editor for a magazine, right? They're all good, but they have their own unique perspective. Yeah. And I think that could be difficult.  However, training people that are not facilitators yet. I think it's easier because yeah, because beginners in facilitation, they love frameworks and they when they see like a canvas or something like that, oftentimes they feel like, okay, I have a map to generate value that is proven by somebody else that generates value, which was like the business mobile canvas thing.  Everybody was doing business mobile canvas and most people did not design the business mobile canvas. But the thing came with such a gravitas that people were like, okay, so this method, I trust it.  Once you get to a certain proficiency level, you start to see opportunities to adjust the business mobile canvas to your own situation, which is how the canvas came up to be and stuff like that.  So I think there's a sweet spot of people that can receive a method, absorb it and implement it. And at some point they start to  to create their own method. And so when choosing people to run somebody else's workshop, I would choose people that have not facilitated a lot of workshops instead of people that have facilitated a lot of workshops.  I think that's what we think about it.

1:12:17 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  OK, interesting. Because I figure if I can get customers to ask for workshops, then I can fill that need by reaching out to the people who are trained as facilitators to deliver that workshops, basically, and then match the two.  So that's kind of where I'm at. The bit in the middle is whether we create our own IP.

1:12:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But in that sense, so I'm thinking out loud, I haven't really reflected too much on this. Would that be a case of you creating some sort of certification for your workshops?

1:13:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Um, if you're going to be training people to deliver specific workshops on that, suppose, yes, uh, that's quite an ask in the sense.  I don't know. I don't know necessarily how that will work or how seriously it would be taken. Um, how easy is it to get a workshop certification?

1:13:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've never, I've never created a certifiable format. It's a question I've been wondering about because, okay, so what I'm thinking is if you solve a specific problem on which you have subject matter expertise, you already have like your own authority on the thing, regardless of the workshop, right?

1:13:50 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:13:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then with the workshop, you, you transform your authority into a process and because you don't want to lose  control of the process, you create some rules around the process and you say if you want to use this, you need to go through this training or something like that.  So this is one way of going about it and I think this way is, I don't have experience in this so I'm just speculating, right?  And there's another way which is the open design created common sort of thing, which I think is much more about reach than revenue, right?  And you can also protect your workshop with that, which is kind of a way of nailing it down and saying our method or team's method is this one.  If you want to do something else, you do something else, but team's method is this one. And the business model is a creative common thing for that reason.  And there's also widely mapping, I don't know if you've heard of it.

1:14:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, I was actually going to suggest widely mapping to you because you were talking about mapping earlier on.

1:15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it be fantastic.

1:15:01 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:15:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think to be honest, I think that if the revenue comes, I don't think the revenue comes from the workshops.  I think the revenue comes from the I suspect is the better word. I suspect that the biggest chunk of revenue doesn't come from the workshops.  It comes from the opportunities that the workshops create. It's like you don't make money by writing a book, but you write a book to get keynotes opportunities.  Yeah, well, it depends.

1:15:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  mean, some workshops, again, it depends. As you mentioned, somebody, somebody charging $80,000. yeah. You know, that that everything from there to 500 pounds for the day.  So there's a there's a big there's a there's a big gap, isn't there? Depends on what level you are doing it.  The other question is who is paying. So whether it's the well, if you can, if you can get a lot of people to work  So the customer is paying for the workshop, and the platform takes a cut, or the platform has sold the workshop and then pays the person to deliver it, in which case the platform takes a bigger cut.  The platform is doing the marketing.

1:16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I got to say, there's so many things in my mind, I'm struggling to But okay, yeah, if you need help putting together a workshop, yeah, I can help with that.  And now I'm really intrigued about like this business side of workshops that I'm always considering. because they are a product right as a product they are their own unique unit economics and you know customer acquisition costs so and then you have those metrics for the workshop but also for the program of which the workshop is part of right so like if you have a program that lasts for two years the lifetime value of a client is whatever a thousand euro and then you have sub workshops as part of that program yeah but not everybody gets to the end the lifetime value of which is slightly different yeah I find this stuff really really interesting because what I'm thinking is what's defense what's defensible where is the mode you know because technically we can create workshops that's  That's easy right so What do we do we sell them after the workshop This is what you said like I have a one-time thing right now Yeah, so I think it depends on again it depends will depend upon who is doing the doing the workshop so What comes out of the workshop either?

1:18:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's a consultant who's delivering the workshop because they want to build the relationship and go on and so if it was consultants own IP Then they're doing a workshop because they want the consulting work thereafter It could be in which case in which case they do that work and there's an additional revenue stream which the platform takes a cut or the platform Maintains a relationship with the customer and then it uses them potentially to suppliers who can execute on Whatever comes out of the out of the workshop a little bit more tenuous because if you're there to supply a workshop The conversation at the end is going to be  people want to switch to suddenly, and now would you like us to do it for you if you're not the consultant during doing the workshop?  Does that make sense? Yeah. Because you've got to make that leap in their mind that you'll now you've gone from being a workshop facilitator to being a consultant.  As opposed to I'm a consultant and this is how I can help you. Let's do a workshop.

1:19:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wow. Yeah, I need to do some thinking on this.

1:19:34 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I've given you a whole load of other things to distract you.

1:19:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Should have known. Yeah, it's true. No, no, it's good. It's good. Yeah, that NC mode now that I'm going over the place, let's keep on.

1:19:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  this is the thing that I'm thinking about. And The more I've looked at it, I've had those little, we'll do this, we'll do, it has to be the AI and you learn more about stuff and then we're learning about facilitation, then I discover AJ and smart and it's like, okay, that's a thing and then, know, so every time you get to a helipad, there's huge area, but I think the sense making is a thing, so I've got SenseMakers, we'll be the name for it as a thing, sensemakers.ai.  But then I've got the digital transformation people brand, so most organizations, so I'm going to talk to some customers potentially and just see what's resonating with people and where the pain is, whether there is a problem, who struggles to get when they're tasked with solving a problem, do they go for workshops and where do they go and find people to deliver the workshops?

1:20:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense and one of the things that I think is really interesting to explore is how people describe their  Yeah, because I think sense makers self identify as sense makers, but I don't think it's an outwardly legible label.  I think other people understand what that means. When they see one at work, they're like, oh my God, this person is really, you know, useful.  But I think it's not very common that people look for sense makers, unless they are themselves sense makers, which is a small group.

1:21:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, which is why there has to be some element of marketing for this.

1:21:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Around the problem. I agree, much.

1:21:38 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  so you need to and you can do that, you can do that on LinkedIn. So you find your target audience, find the sorts of problems that they're having, validate it, market it, and then build capability to supply people to solve the problem.  You know, it might just be that they're going to go and deliver a Lego workshop with a certified Lego person.  If we can create demand for that, we can go and find the people to deliver it. So it's really about the marketing as far as that's concerned.  As far as the business model is concerned, the question is about how you retain ownership with a customer and how you sweat them as an asset.  That relationship takes to increase the lifetime value of that customer.

1:22:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So me, in my case, was generally speaking.

1:22:26 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And just in terms of solving this as a problem. So I'm thinking about this in terms of a specific problem objectively.  How I do it or how we do it. It's all kind of up in the air.

1:22:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that when you transform expertise into a workshop, it becomes a product in your portfolio. And that's how needs to be managed.  You'll have other questions as you use it about to expand it, how to communicate, how to iterate on it, how to train for it, how to make it faster, to change the outcomes.  As a product that you keep running, it will get a life of its own.

1:23:26 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  The third thing you said was three workshops, so basically working with IPM and is to create workshops for them.  You have a process for doing that, do you? If I was able to introduce you to someone who's got IP that needs to structure their workshops, that's something you could do at the beginning, middle and end.  This is Huey, this is what he's going to do for you. This is the process. Here's the outcome. This is what it's going to cost you.

1:24:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so the process is basically you make kind of a service audit on all previous services that you have actually sold, not things that you wish you were doing, but things you've sold, right?  Actually done, yeah.

1:24:17 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:24:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then on those, you figure out either by estimation, by feedback, or by just best practices, you pull out what's the moment of truth, let's say.  Yeah. I'm still struggling with the right name for this thing. I want to have a nice name. But let's say it's a magic moment.  So there's a magic moment. Whenever people work with Tim, there's something that Tim does that usually that's what gets people excited.  For me, personally, when I've asked around and people tell me that it's when they see me manipulating Miro and sense making in real.  Did you say jewel? Jewel.

1:25:02 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Because I've been calling you Jewie, haven't I?

1:25:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It just did, but you don't do it all the time.

1:25:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Because I remember you coaching me on how to pronounce your name, and I remember you saying Jewie.

1:25:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm sure you should.

1:25:14 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Is Jew?

1:25:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wow. Jewel? Wow. I could have the wrong way around.

1:25:18 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Sorry. No problem.

1:25:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem. And so the first thing that you do an audit of services you have actually provided and have done to people.  And then you see what was the most exciting for people. And then you isolate that. And you create a workshop around that experience, right?  Because in that sense, you highlight what's the most interesting about you, right? And you connect that with other services you have so that at the end of that workshop, you can see different doors into other possible services.  So you start to find, at the end, you want people to buy more of your services. Yeah. You need to know what they are.  That's why you do the audit.

1:25:59 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

1:26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you pick one service that you do really well that people really like you for and use that as the entry point.  And you'll list all the information you'll need to get the result you want. And then some of that information you collect beforehand via, know, entry forms and stuff like that, or your own desk research.  And some of that information you collect during the workshop. Depending on the information you want from the work you want to collect, there's different tools or primitives that you can use.  So you build the workshop around the end goal that you want and the questions that you need answered. With those two things, you organize the workshop and you have a workshop that is based on your actual noticeable externally legible expertise.  Because people have told you, I really like when you do this thing. Yeah, I try to avoid too much speculation because sometimes you need to do it because clients really want to do a completely new thing.  But we I've yet to find clients that are really good at assessing if something will be a success or not because people get excited and they're like optimistic.  Yeah. So I prefer to go into stuff that they have done before.

1:27:25 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. Interesting. I've just had an idea. Just as an aside, I'll express it and then we can park it.  But it's just suddenly struck me that within an organisation, not as a sales tool, but as an understanding what we as a department are all about, what we can do for you.  Is there anything like a workshop that we explain so the HR department can explain who they are, what it is that they do and how you can engage with the HR department.  What you're talking about is a way of presenting information about of capability, taking them through a process. You mean to another internal audience?

1:28:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. I think it would be different, but you could do it, let's say, on-boarding. So I'm a new employee.  I'm joining a new company. And I have a day with back-to-back on-boarding sessions, right? I like to think in terms of the bronze, the silver, and the gold versions of things.  So I think the bronze version would be, it just gets like a recorded call with the head of HR, and the head of compliance, and the head of, yeah, OK.  But then a more interesting thing would be if it has an element of interaction to it, because I think workshops are supposed to be interactive.  Otherwise, it's just a keynote presentation. If there's an element of interaction to it, and you use it to collect people's  I think there's two main things you can do with that sort of workshop. One of them is to collect those expectations from that department, like, oh, I really expect HR to do this sort of thing for me, that's interesting.  And the other one is to create committees and devices from people that are participating. Like an agreement, everybody participates in the HR workshop and at the end they resign in an agreement, like, oh, I understand my company's vision and I'll work towards it.  I think that's another thing that in the context of an onboarding workshop would make sense. But I could think more about this, that this too makes sense to me.

1:29:41 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I'm only thinking just because if that's a thing within corporate, there's a communication between silos. It's a way of packaging up communication about what these people over here do.  It breaks, it would help. Anyway, we need to be talking to the corporates to find out whether that's the case.  If it is a thing and it's not being done, then it would be a big opportunity. So you do the workshop-y thing, so what would that cost somebody then to come up with a full workshop, would you say?

1:30:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's the same thing I said before, the four sessions, 5,000.

1:30:31 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  That's for the workshop. Is that face-to-face or is that online?

1:30:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is online. I could prepare the workshop to be face-to-face. I could train to be face-to-face. The logistics would be different.  But again, the good thing about the primitives is that if you have the right primitives, you could have the same scale.  done for online or face-to-face workshops or hybrid workshops. If you start with the primitives and not the activities, you can do this.  If you start with the activities, then it breaks when you try to shift from one format to the other.

1:31:14 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, and you can do design sprints and things, can you? Yeah, I've done that, yeah.

1:31:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, okay.

1:31:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Interesting. Okay, so where are we then? Have I bamboozled you with too many questions? Okay, you and I, I think, are both focused on the out of the possible, so we're always expanding to converge.

1:31:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Certainly you've given me a lot to talk about, to think about, and I see some things I didn't see before, especially around this more the business side of things.  mean, I don't think I was fully... I on that, but you gave me a lot of nuance there that I think I'll chew on that for a while.  in terms of focusing the workshop creation on what people are asking for, think it's also very... It's probably much easier.  And yeah, there's things we could do for sure. And I'm thinking about next steps or something like that. And I see so many different next steps that I'm a little bit lost.

1:32:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. So what's your ambition? What's your goal in terms of building a bit? What do you want to do with your career?  Do you want to build something? How do you see what you're doing in the moment? Why are you doing this?

1:32:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm one of those guys that needs to create his own job. I think that's the thing. And I don't want to hire people, so I don't want to grow.  I want to be solo and have time to really go deep on the stuff that I care about. For instance, I don't know if it's a business objective, but I really like the fact that I can just read some scientific articles about some stuff and then try to apply it to my way of working, right?  But I've noticed it's kind of a big deal. I remember like, oh, I want a job that allows me to keep studying stuff.  But in terms of business objectives, I want to become a reference in the specific intersection, workshops for consultants. And I think that means being more visible around that, participating more in communities and groups and master classes and stuff like that, publishing a lot more, not ready yet for YouTube push, but maybe at some point, that kind of thing.

1:34:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  does this answer your question? Yeah it does. Anything I would say from doing workshops for consultants, the more customers become afa with what is good and what works, that is what they will ask for.  So if you found yourself a business consultant who's very good at what they do and they've created their own business model campus, I would imagine the customer will actually want, because we now know about Osterwalder and business model campus, so we want you to do this.  We want it in a standard way. We don't want your IP necessarily. Does that make sense?

1:34:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, yeah. They don't want my IP, the one from Jeanne. Well I suppose actually, yeah.

1:34:53 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  The other thing is then whether or not business model campus would be, and again, forget term that you use, not artifacts, but something else, Pa.  I think I call it artifact, no?

1:35:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, what was the other things that you were talking about in the visual framework, memetic?

1:35:15 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's the things you can bring into a workshop to achieve a certain...

1:35:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Primitive. Primitives.

1:35:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It is a business model canvas. If you were doing a workshop that said, okay, we need to sort this business out, and you get to the point and it goes, okay, we've uncovered the fact that the business model isn't very good.  Let's do the business model canvas, that context, would that be a primitive? Or would that be another workshop?

1:35:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a great question. I would say it's another workshop, because I think primitives are with more platonic solids, pyramids, spheres, cubes, stuff like that.  And from those, can build anything.

1:35:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So that is already kind of assembled.

1:35:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, it has a set of... primitives to it. But that's, that's a good point. Okay. All right.

1:36:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, then. So let's have a thing. I've probably got quite high visibility in the market that you're trying to address.  Are you looking, you're looking for consultants that you can help?

1:36:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:36:23 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So I think there's some, there is a way that we can collaborate, potentially. I've got lots of bits up in the air.  just trying to figure out the model. I've got various people that I'm sort of collaborating with but we're not there yet, if that makes sense.  But I think, for me, I've got to talk to some customers in the way that I said to you at the beginning, you got to focus on the problem.  I need to have customers instead of polishing the solution, I've got to talk to some customers, so that I know that it's a real problem.  And then I know how to engage that real problem, then I'll know how to build what we need to build to deliver the solution.  But I think that your capability kind of fits nicely with all of this. If that makes sense, this conversation is useful for me.  Does that make sense? No, does.

1:37:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you mind if I send you something? Sure. So these are some posts that are kind of in a draft mode.  And I'll send it to you. I'll send them to you. It's not homework, but this might be interesting for you.  It talks about how I think about some of this stuff.

1:37:57 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay.

1:38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm very open to feedback if you have it. Okay.

1:38:04 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So I will read that. I'm just putting it into the other document so I don't lose it when we come off the call.  Excellent. One person I'm talking to at the moment is very interested in change. And part of his model is working with an organization for a period of time to get that change delivered.  And part of that I think would be choosing from a number of different workshops at different stages of that change to move things along.  So again, I think that's possibly something that could fit into this mix as well, that once you're engaged you get people, because there'll be different barriers that you come across to executing on the change.  Depending upon the level of people in the organization, what is it they're trying to do, what blockers they come up against.  it might be, okay, fine, we've discovered that we've got a strategy problem. a collaboration problem with good communication, cooperation, whatever it happens to be, and maybe a workshop here and here could be something which would unlock this team to deliver that change.  Does that make sense? he's quite interested in doing that on a go-to-market. I've got lots of things in terms of network and community and brand.  So just kind of work if we kind of talked about this some more and saw how we could collaborate around it.  Does that make sense? Yeah, it does.

1:39:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think actually our challenge is to pick one specific direction and put enough force behind it to go somewhere.  But I think we can find something that makes sense. Can you give me a couple of days and I just put some ideas on to an email and we just yeah, yeah something together Yeah.

1:40:07 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Oh, you have you got work coming in at the moment? So you are you getting work to do or it's how you finding that?  I'm getting work to do.

1:40:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Think I Yeah, I'm getting work to do but my pipeline is not as populated as I would love But yeah, I do have some capacity.  Yeah, right.

1:40:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay.

1:40:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:40:29 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Oh And then we need to think about If nothing, it this this wouldn't Think about how we can bring some people into the into your pipeline if we can articulate this the service that you can offer them Effectively product ties and go right is anyone interested in this Yeah, I mean Actually, this is a great push because it's a great nudge from it because I've been you know having conversations like this and I

1:41:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  some thoughts into paper, but one friend of mine said it should just record a video, a short video, maybe a room, where you explain like how we look at this.  And I'll do that for you, so it won't be like a production ready, but maybe that's something that you can use to make this go further.  Would this be a format that's useful to you? That would be really interesting.

1:41:31 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I'm saying is in terms of bringing consultants in for you to work on their workshops, it would be good if we could articulate the beginning, middle and end.  So workshops are important because if you can bring this to a work, to an environment with YAL, then bring this to a workshop with a conversation with YAL.  You will end up with something like this and this will be a key to unlock customers for you. So that's the outcome for them, which kind of gets your pipeline up.  Yeah, no, I'm just I'm also thinking about the customer side into my own perspective in terms of potentially working together to design and create workshops which solve customer needs that we discover which maybe we can create our own IP around solving those problems.  For sure.

1:42:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Would it be useful for you if I send you my customer interview guide?

1:42:30 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, send me everything. If you've done a customer interview guide, I'll also send you a link to a in fact I can do it now.  Bear with me a second. Okay, so I'll send this via email.

1:42:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know you won't be judgmental. Oh, hang on.

1:43:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I'm just gonna copy. Oh, here we go. is, you know, Lenny, Lenny's podcast.

1:43:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, Khachisky, Khachisky, I don't know. Yeah, but Lenny. You know Lenny?

1:43:12 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah. I don't know him personally.

1:43:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  know who he is.

1:43:15 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  know all of Okay, there's a, there's a, there's an instrument that he called Jen Abel. And she's talking about sales, but really a big chunk of it is she's actually talking about customer interviews.  And it's brilliant. Really, really good. Oh, I got it.

1:43:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Oh, I've just, I sent it to my daughter.

1:43:38 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So I'm calling you M in there. Okay.

1:43:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

  I do.

1:48:48 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  That's why I the newsletter than I do. It's funny, I was talking to somebody today, and this is the guy who sells the courses.  His name is Rob Llewellyn, so he's been telling, he's been making loads of money selling courses. for years. He was a transformation leader and he created these courses and we were talking about, have you ever heard of Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab, right hook?  You know, the marketing guy, I can forget what his name is now, but he read his book about marketing and you give, give, give and then you take.  Oh, Hormozzi? No, I can't remember his name. It will come to me, anyway, he's done that, give, give, give, take, take and I give, give, given.  So, because I never really had a product other than recruitment and recruitment is very much monetized. So I've been exploring this thing.  Anyway, so I can't remember his guy's name. I remember there's a book called Jab, Jab, Jab, right hook. Anyway, yes, I do like  sharing content that was fine conversations I have with people there's always something you can point them at yeah no and there's a satisfaction of making that that match right oh I think you'd like this and then you pick from your sources you need to send something right the thing about that is you cannot charge for it it's the same with you you end up in the friend zone um so unless you have that I'm good at that yeah somebody said to me um there's a chat that I'm talking to who an ideal person for you I think who does workshops um and he said we're sort of coaching each other and he said he said to me I need to stand for something so I need to make I need to take a position on something rather than sort of being aware of stuff I need to take a position otherwise otherwise it's hard to sell anything anyway so that's yeah interesting yeah very much thank you so much I really gotta go because I've been drinking too much water
