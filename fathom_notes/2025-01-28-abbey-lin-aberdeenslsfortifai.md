0:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  how are you?

0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm well I know.

0:04 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Did you have a good holiday?

0:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  guess it's almost like the end of January but yes it is long gone but it was very nice and whilst it lasted.

0:13 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah okay that's good.

0:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes it's got be strange and you see people after New Year's.

0:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Happy New Year!

0:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But great so I think we can jump right in in that our our tool is finally ready to be tested one part of it in the next two weeks so we are starting that set up process.  I have a presentation to turn it on board and get some feedback from you on how you want to do it and I have been thinking a lot about you know ISO 14064 and the one that you're you're also looking at and interested and I'm really curious if we can try to get that onto our tool so that like before June so that you can also use that too but first we're going to let me grab my presentation so we can share it a little bit.

1:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There and yes, let's see.

1:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right, here we go. All right, so we can hear, okay.

1:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have your typing, but let's see.

1:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So last time we met, we showed some overall designs. We also looked at risk management and third party, and we started rebuilding the app from scratch in October.  I think the last time we met, we talked about the kickoff, which is like this meeting for planning. So now we've updated the designs, and I'll show you a design there, and policies, trainings, and communication is ready for deployment and testing, and then we're building out the environmental section for ISO 14001.  But as I've mapped out ISO 14001, I don't think we're too far away ISO 14064, which makes me positive about that.  Then the next step is the controls launch, which will be ideally two weeks later, we'll launch the controls part of it for testing.  So this is, yeah, so this is, the admin view, it's changed slightly but it's a little bit prettier and we have kind of sections that we have and we've been changing around based on feedback that we've had already, is that there's company-wide documents and I think we've renamed it meaning documents you want to deploy across the organization, you want sign off and then there's other internal documents that you just want to keep that you don't necessarily need people to sign off on and then there's another section for the ones that are doing ISO, it's like some ISO documentation that you can put here just so that you have in case the auditor comes okay and then we have the employee portal which is here so this is like you're going to look at the policies here and then you're going to deploy them and then employees will get a notification being like hey here's a policy that you need to fill in and then they need to fill it like they need to review it and then sign off on that so that's the process there so then our question is like you know how do we test in a way that feels safe for you and that some want to individual  test it out. Some want three or four people to test it out. We haven't had that many that want to do a wider test group, but it's been mainly option A and B that we've been getting feedback from our pilots.  Is there anyone that you prefer in kind of the first launch?

3:15 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  When you say individually, you mean one person and a few friends, in turn it means a couple of people poking and figuring out what to do.

3:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think it's one individually, it's just like you testing it out and deploying it and then you going into the employee portal and checking it yourself as one person and then for option B as like maybe we give in two logins or three logins and you guys can all test around poke or send it to each other and then poke it that way.

3:42 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah, clearly we will go for option B for us to fully understand this because me understanding it is not good enough people who are implementing it need to understand it as well.  So option B is good for us. Okay, great.

3:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then we'll come back and ask for the their contact information so we can give them a log in, but we'll talk about that in the next one.  So the typical feedback right now we're looking for and for policies, procedures, trainings is pretty straightforward. I think the next launch will be a little bit more complicated controls, but for this first one it's more about I like the feature here, I can click the button, it doesn't work.  So just kind of general things on usability around policies and training. And then for communication, how would you like to communicate on Slack?  Do you guys use Slack or Teams?

4:34 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  But Teams, we are trying to look at our security side as well and Teams is slightly more secured than Slack and our infrastructure, so Teams might be better for us to be honest.  Okay, yeah and then that's fine. We have some like on Teams and someone flux so it's whichever one.

4:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I can create a Teams folder and part of that is also if you have any documentation, like for example like your environmental management system since you already  have that. If you already have documentation that you just want to upload in this system, you can put it in that inks folder and we can upload it so you have it already there when we go to launch so you can see it.  And then some will have like for the governance side, we already have some like anti bribery corruption policies that you can look at and we have an anti bribery corruption training and we have a typical environmental management training that's already there for ISO 14001 that you can just you've already had it so you don't necessarily need but you can see if you wanted to eventually have your own for ISO 1464 then you can do that you understand the functionality of that.  So in terms of testing feedback, you like us like you would you like to just us to give you the link and then we set up a call maybe a week later to get feedback or you like to just walk through it like immediately and throw your feedback at the same time as you go through it.  It depends upon how much time we have in hands isn't it?

5:52 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  So probably the first option might be better that we have a look and feel and then send look can you explain this thing for  rather than wasting too much of time of each other trying to figure out what is what. Yeah, that sounds good.  Then we'll go for option A on that.

6:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I think that is really the main ones. I have some other slides around the S side for some customers that are curious about what policies we'll have for the S.  But I think for you, we'll probably do the E and the G side. So anti-bribery and corruption policy, maybe code of conduct, third party management.  If you have any of these policies already, then we can just put it into the team side and then we can upload them for you.  But there's also going be a function in our tool where you can upload the documents yourself into that there.  And so, yeah, I think that's really, I just realized it's only been six minutes. I went through that very quickly, so.  Don't worry about it.

6:52 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  been very efficient with our time.

6:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Are there any questions or anything around the launch?

7:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  in terms of time and did you say that it would be available at some point in time in February?  Yeah, we're planning for the launch.

7:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  me look at my calendars. The week of February 9th is when we plan on having that ready.

7:17 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  It's just that I will be going away from my desk for three weeks starting from 12th of February. I don't mind doing it on the week commencing 10th, but I effectively will only have three days.  mean, do you want to do it within that period where I can pull in other people from the company and they can continue to work on it in my absence?  Or do you want us to get involved at some point in time in the second week of March?

8:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because, yeah, when do you come back? come back then in the second week of March. come back the second week of March, March.  I guess, I can easily be part of it, 10th, 11th, and 12th, it's not a problem.

8:14 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Then let other people who are going to implement it be around with it for three weeks, and then we can come back and have an input on 10th and see that, look, these are our feedback, or we can get a vote from 10th and can do it in a couple of days.

8:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Maybe because you guys are interested in the 14-06-04 more, maybe it makes more sense to join in March, because then we'll have also the controls has been launched by then.

8:46 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  So then you get to review two of them together, and you can see the flow for that.

8:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So maybe that actually- it makes sense. Otherwise, you won't get the feedback that you're expecting from us, which with my presence not being there.

9:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  And then we'll waste unnecessarily your time for a month. Yeah. No, I think that's okay. And then I can still open the team site.

9:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then you can also stick any kind of documentation, because I'm also curious about your 10, you know, your 1464, because then by March we can maybe have some of that stuff into, we can add that into, if you want, into the one.  Yeah, we are trying to work with the local accreditation agency in UK called BSI, which is... yeah, we had a conversation with them actually about the partnerships with them.  Okay, so we are trying to work with them.

9:39 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  are at this point in time in advanced discussions in terms of, because we are going from 1464 to 68, all of the accreditation over the next 12 months, 18 months period.  So we were just trying to figure out, they're trying to figure out what we are doing so that they haven't done it yet.

9:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They have only given accreditation to one...

10:03 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  One company as of now, so they're keen to work with us to understand and develop everything. So it's a more of a developing thing working with them.

10:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There aren't many who have gone down that route yet in this country. But it would be interesting, I don't know if you'd be open to it because I'm also talking with BSI on our side in terms of reviewing our tools so that they are comfortable with it, that the auditing process will be a lot easier and cheaper for companies.  And like if you're discussing with them like they're doing consultancy and then we have like the software where you can kind of, you know, they can implement it or something that could be maybe a partnership.

10:46 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I've already told them about your presence within our ISO space. So they are aware that, you know, this is what we are looking to implement in terms of it.  I wasn't sure that. you were discussing with them. Otherwise, I would have stressed about 45 more. But I'm sure it's so big.  So I'm sure I was probably speaking with someone in the Nordics and you're probably speaking in the UK.

11:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so but I would happy to discuss that because I'm realizing I just went through the 14,001 process and it's relatively straightforward, at least for some of the companies that are going for it on our side.  it could be good to integrate. Because you're doing it somewhat manually, in terms of kind of that process, right?  So if we're able to somehow integrate, like take kind of some of the learnings that you've been doing for years and then integrate them into digitalization controls, then that might also be easier for future audits and kind of managing all of these different ones.  yeah.

11:45 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I think the timeframe of the second week of March actually works better because we are, it will take time for us to get to the point with BSI there saying a crib sheet.  Look, this is what we need. This is how you should be collecting and then measure. and impact and all those kind of things.

12:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  delaying it a bit would be beneficial, I think, for both of us. Yeah, that's perfect because then when you have that, we can have a discussion on how to innovate it with our tools.

12:10 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  That's great.

12:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We can just up a time and are you pretty open in March? We could just put it. I'll explain it to them.

12:21 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah, as of now, I'm pretty open. So you pitch in your date and then we can work towards it.  Okay. No, then I think it's good.

12:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I will set up the team, so at least you have that and you can stick documentation in it, and we can escape from there.  Then yeah, if you have any documents, send that and we'll upload that. Then if not, then we retouch space in March for the launch to see where we are in there.

12:48 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Hopefully, we would have made enough progress for us to say, look, this is exactly the documentation we have. These are the things that we are working on and we can have slightly more credible rather than conceptual discussion.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

13:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we'll be you'll be able to see more of our tool that says, okay, this is how it launches and how it works.  And then that that makes more sense.

13:08 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  That's perfect.

13:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think the timing works well that that too, because we'll be farther ahead by March with with that.

13:13 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Okay, great. So so what's through your timelines? There is no hurry. You can tell me at any time until first week of March that when exactly do you want it to you don't have to commit to the date now you can.  Okay, thank you.

13:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I might just find a time in the calendar just to hold our calendars before they get in full.  I think no, that's good.

13:32 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Then we'll set that up.

13:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  um, anything else? Any other questions? Shall to anything?

13:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, not not on my side. Um, if you want to show more more screens or anything, but no, I think we're okay.

13:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then but so you already have a standard you you pass 14 064 already and now you're going to 68 or you in the process?

13:53 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  No, it is it is in the because it is all interlinked. Yeah, you cannot

14:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  really have two different standards in terms of your own own processes they are all into I mean 14 and 664 is about greenhouse gas emission measurement then you have net zero and then you have net neutrality or carbon neutrality sorry so everything kind of falls in line so you can't really do piecemeal one thing and this way or one thing that way yeah we have to do it as a block yeah okay so you're going for both yeah like at the same time in there yes that makes sense okay great um all right then we have a plan um I just like ping me if there's any questions it's good seeing you again and yeah same year I'm glad that you have made you've made huge progress in such a short time thank you I know since we've been talking it's been a lot and I'm so excited to come on board I'd be like some companies I've been talking for even longer than you so I'm like now I'm getting embarrassing we need to just get going so don't be embarrassed about anything

15:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  But great.

15:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But thank you for your time and good travels then, then we'll be in touch in March. you so much.  All right, take care. Thank you.
