2:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, sorry, hello, my microphone. Hello. How are you?

2:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Good, you?

2:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Ready for? Oh, my internet is playing me. Wait. Can you hear me well? Yes. I think I'll put on my 5G to, yeah.  Okay, okay, I'm back. So, ready for the weekend?

2:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What? Ready for the weekend, yes. yes yeah yeah i'm about to i'm preparing everything to costarica that i'm living on on wednesday so i'm going to be like 10 days 10 days you live on wednesday so wednesday is the fourth yes until the 12th until the 12th almost 10 days yes okay okay okay we'll talk about dates later but so basically thank you for for giving me the time to figure out how to organize things because well you you know me by now i wanted to have like a plan of how we go about this and i think we have it but i'd like to check with you like if i'm on the right direction right so basically and correct me um we've done this framework work together  Right now, the biggest thing in your radar is a six-week program, which you want to launch around mid-January, so you can open it on mid-January, but start doing it on February, correct?

4:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. And the idea behind that is that this six-week program is obviously not the first program you do, but it's a new thing, and it could be kind of a core offering where you connect other offerings around it.  Is this also...?

4:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, I see it like having like lots of cohorts, you know, and I'm just optimizing the curriculum and creating an affiliate program, but at the end I want to keep the essence, you know?  And I was thinking I can make it real complex, but at the end we want simplicity, know, and that's...  that's why I also need help because I know I can aim to talk to different people to how I choose the language but at the essence I was thinking you know why do people come to me you know they don't come because of the you know based on or the you know like the way of my thinking they come because yes they like my professionality but they also come because they want to heal trauma to you know to to heal pain in a way so I am trying to balance between okay let's in the six-week program we're going to talk about trauma and the shadow work but at the end we don't want to stay in the emotional side you know we need to go to the emotional but at the end we also need to go to there's different process it's the the inner dynamics and the outer support you know so yes I just want to say this is good this is good  because I'm glad I asked this because from our previous conversations I was leaning towards more the creative powers of this which from what you tell me is still a part of it but it's not like the main thing there's there's we still keep the tree like the the emotions and the rationality and the the science of the clinical aspect and the creative right yeah like we we are going to talk about the creative and I was thinking you know I can decide you know like maybe the six week a program could be about defining designing prototyping with that language but at the end maybe it's too complex to say we're going to see the same thing for normal users you know and and yes I I want to talk to professionals but if they already know design thinking why would they come to me to learn design thinking you know we're doing design thinking

7:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  but without telling them you know so that's why I want to do you know we're gonna do it but without saying it you know we're doing innovation but without saying it I'm doing innovation all the time but I don't need to say I'm an innovator you know it's just my essence it's something about what I do and it's an inner value you know that people can see in the work that I do but it's not about it's like when you make money you don't say oh I have tons of money you know people see it yeah yeah now I I love that because I think that's a very common and I've done it as well which is a very common trap which is we learn something we get excited about the thing and we want to keep talking about the thing but we can just know learn the thing and use the thing and and within our circle of excellence so I love that you said it cool so if that's this is still the the main thing  And a lot of this is, and I see that in your language that you're using right now, lot of this is about being practical, about figuring out, like, if I take this thing away, I take away my essence, but I can take this thing away without negatively impacting my essence.  Right. So there's a few decisions there. And what the way I've organized this is that we figure out ways of making these decisions in a very explicit and permanent way, right?  Because like I said, you want to do cohort after cohort after cohort. So it's okay if this first cohort is not a diamond, but it needs to be a precious stone, but it doesn't have to be like a lapidated diamond, right?  So the first date of it is the project planning. this would be two sessions, 90 minutes, the same sort of dynamic we've been doing.  but with a different set of frameworks and Miro boards and stuff like that. And the output of this is a couple of things.  So the first one is, and I have everything in the document. I'll send you the document, which is speed at your own time.  But the first one is we do it on Miro, so it's visually, it's organized, and it's not the one-off thing.  So we do it and that same Miro, we keep using that Miro to tracking the project. And because you're familiar with it, you clearly like that idea of going back to the same Miro, which I like.  It's just a single source of truth, so that's good. And you get all of this thinking made very clear and useful for you after the sessions.  So even if you say, I want just these sessions, I want to work with some other people, you can still keep using the Miro.  it will have your password, it's your mirror and you can do everything with it and that's a thing. There's another element which is combining the mirror with the project sync sessions and these are smaller short sessions that are more focused about figuring out how the project is going, diagnosing possible blockers and addressing these blockers.  You'll be interacting with I think several suppliers, several vendors, maybe different platforms, it's outside of your comfort zone in this aspect.  It's a new set of things and if you're like me at some point you might get stuck on some aspect that from your perspective it's difficult to side step but from an outside perspective it's like oh we could just do this other thing and go around the problem.  But that's the focus on the project sync sessions. And so the project sync sessions are this thing. The project planning is that thing.  And you can either get the project planning or you can get the project planning and the sync sessions. I don't think it makes much sense to have the sync sessions without the project planning.  But if you really want the flexibility, there's something that is kind of like the sync sessions but is more free form.  Which is a pack of clarity sessions, right? Which they also last for the same amount like 45 minutes. And this is more like thinking together.  It's less structured, it's less about problem solving, it's less about unlocking the thing. And to be absolutely honest, I don't think this is the one you should get because of the time frame you have, okay?  If you want to, we can try to make it work but I'm conscious of the fact that... We are on a tight time frame and maybe that for that this moment the clarity sessions would be a bit risky They could bring a lot of ideas and Possible directions Does any of this make sense or do you think it's along the same the right lines?

13:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It sounds good the break planning The pre-planning, right? Yes, because how can we do things if we don't you know What are what is the most important thing to get now by this deadline and things like that?  You know so we cannot I cannot like This will help me to not overwhelm because I already do that because Just be by myself.  It's like I go to the gym by myself It's different if I have a coach that I forgot me so that's why I'm it's good for me to start with that I think I Agree I agree

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean okay so I'll share my screen because it's easier for you I think to keep the information if you're seeing what I'm seeing.  Okay so this is the proposal you can check it out later.

14:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's basically the conversation we're having now but I think this will be more helpful for this right of the conversation.

14:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's the project planning I believe this will take us two sessions, 90-minute sessions. If it doesn't I will not charge extra for that.  I mean it's my commitment to make sure that you get what you pay for and we divide these sessions into parts and the first one is specify your business goal in a very clear way.  every project is about the teams and business goals and when we jump into the project and guilty as charged.

14:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  When we jump into the project without having that really clear

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  time comes to make decisions like prioritization decisions like I don't want to do this or this doesn't fit the schedule it becomes really difficult to prioritize and we often choose things that are interesting or cool or fun but they're not the things that need to be done okay so the first session will be about this and the second session is a bit more about breaking down the goal into specific components and this is like project management one-on-one so you have a goal you break it down into deliverables you break down the deliverables into work packages and you break down those down into tasks right so it goes is a cascading thing oh what's his name her name sorry it's it's Maya Maya oh I'm Maya  I have a cat, sometimes you see like a little tail going by.

16:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Sometimes they just need a little bit of love, you know, they don't get enough love.

16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like for them the whole reason for our existence is for us to give them cuddles and stuff like that.  So, yeah, I know the feeling. So anyway, so the project planning, that's the thing. And you could just say, you what, I just want the project plan.  And then there's the project sync. I took a look at the calendar and I think it makes sense to think about six project sync sessions.  And this is about, you know, track progress on earth blockers and create strategies to overcome these blockers. It is less structured than the project planning.  It has structure. There's like set questions and there's a specific way we do this to make sure that we're not just, you know, having cool conversation we want to be like really focused on at the end of each project sync session.  If you had something that was walking you and I will have a way to move forward if you have something that You were we're not so sure about now you have more clarity.  So that's the goal of the sync sessions. They are the square or the boring part of, you know, just me putting more timers and really leaning into that.  And the clarity sessions is the thing together sessions. They are completely independent, like I said, so you don't need them.  You don't need them if you don't need to do them or if you can do it them without doing the things is really up to you and I'm thinking about for a pack of sessions and yeah, like I said, given the time frame.  My suggestion is that you do not go with this, but you have the ultimate say, of course. So far, so good?

18:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool, so far so good, yes.

18:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me tell you about the pricing and that kind of thing.

18:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think you can see my whole screen here.

18:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Each option is independent, so you can choose whichever makes the most sense to you. There's no need to add them up, and it's basically the same sort of approach we've had for the past one.

18:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you want more zoom? No, I'm looking at it. This about And it's merely about just planning the project or we can discuss as well some some things or it's just pure planning.

19:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you, can you rephrase that because basically it's more planning, basically more about planning, but just to be sure I'm answering the right question.  Yes.

19:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like the difference between the clarity sessions, the clarity sessions, it's more about the creative aspect, right? Like, exploring options and taking decisions.  private planning, it's going to be more about organizing the project and about understanding the priorities and things like that, right?  Yeah, yeah. Okay.

19:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, correct. I talk too much.

19:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, I'm thinking, you know, like, the thing to be two 90-minute session, it's because the first one, it's about the organization and the second one, it's about the follow-up, or what would be the difference between the two.  Uh-huh.

20:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first one is about getting the... I know what I went to say, but I'm struggling with words.  So the first one is to get, like, where we want to get, what's the objective, how do we know we got there, how do we know we have arrived, what's the most important, what are the most important things?  So this gives us, like, the boundaries of the project, okay? It lets us know, like, how much money you to spend, or other things like that.  It's stuff.

20:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And the second thing is, like, based on those boundaries of the project, we will need to make decisions. But before we make decisions, we need to know what decisions we need to make, right?

20:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first session, it will tell us, like, what do you want?

20:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How much time we have?

20:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What kind of people are you talking

22:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  we look for the shiny object, right?

22:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  course, of course. And I'm glad I've mentioned that because this is like the four principles of what I'm thinking about.

22:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, okay. I just read a book about the six pieces of creativity and about Edward Bono, the lateral thinking, and he says about we need to limit creativity in order to be amazing.  Make work. I like that. How did you come up with those ideas? Your experience? Yeah, I think I've told you, right?

22:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been diagnosed with ADHD, like almost all of my friends. And before I knew that, I was just very frustrated that I had a lot of ideas and I struggled with making them happen because I was trying to follow the usual productivity advice.  And then I figured that I needed to figure out my own ways of doing creative work. And, you know, keep reading about stuff and figuring out what makes sense for me, what works for me, what doesn't.  And it's much easier to put these things on a paper than to leave them, I'm aware.

23:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But if we don't put them on paper, for sure we don't leave them. Have you heard about the future thinking as well?  It's like about knowing there's some feasible things to do. There's some preferable things to do. There's some desire things we can do.  Like there's a list of probable scenarios, but at the end, the reality it's another thing again. Yeah. It's interesting, but what I like about the second package, the package number two, it says that it said all of previous.  What does it mean all of previous?

24:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it means this thing and the project syncing sessions.

24:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And what would it be the difference between project syncing and the clarity sessions? It's like a follow up of the project in a way, but what else can we chat about in the project syncing?

24:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not much, to be honest.

24:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So the project syncing is, so I'll give you an example of how to address this.

24:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the project syncing, we will have a space in the mirror called the parking lot. Okay, whenever an idea comes up that is interesting, but it's not for right now.  We'll put it on the parking lot Okay, because you are really focused on what's the thing we need to solve right now?

25:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, and I'll be annoying with it I'll be Boring with it. No, I you should because if we want to expand our mind We will always right but you need to put constraints.  Yeah and The clarity sessions they don't have a parking lot.

25:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So everything is kind of valid, right and I Think is the main like when you look at the mirror, but he's the main exam the main thing like The project sink they do have a structure.  There's questions. I'll ask and stuff like that and there's kind of frameworks Not okay, thanks Go ahead. What if I get it?

25:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The clarity session is more divergent thinking and pray planning and pray thinking it's more convergent It's like defining options, right?

25:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfectly put

26:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, yes, I think I think I will prefer the conversion because in the divergent thinking, yes, it's good to talk about the the possibilities, but I already have lots of possibilities.  It's about you helping me filter, synthesize, and define like what are we gonna do now, you know, and let's keep to it.  And they have the foundation, you know, like why are we deciding on this? know, like it has your values, people love it, but you know we need to decide, know, let's not explore more, you know, you already know you have five ideas of the program.  Let's decide why do you decide you need to pick one right now, which one would you pick, you know, you know, this is the kind of framework that I need to to move on.  So maybe maybe that's come from the planner, right, because planning is just not putting the list of the tasks, you know, it's about defining, right?  Yeah, planning, planning is so then you take your take on plan.

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you know like the overview of what what planning means for you got it so the planning is about being I think above all being very explicit about how we think the work will happen because we always have some sort of implicit idea of how this will happen we have an idea of what it could be and we think oh maybe I should hire these guys and I should hire these guys or maybe I we have a notion of how things stay in place right but most people and I think especially true for creative people this notion we have is very optimistic and vague like oh yeah figure it out we have time stuff like that and the planning is just take the ideas that are in your mind about what you want to do and put them on the paper and then you see them and like oh my god I want to make 50 things this is a lot and now I cannot  avoid the fact that I am sure that I cannot do all of these things.

28:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So if I cannot do all of these things, which things do I want to do, right?

28:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for me planning is all about taking our mental picture of the imagined process not to make that mental picture like a real picture.  We think it works like this, it will happen like this. And if this were a project with more people, with a lot more stakeholders, it would make it more complex because of that, right?  Because each person has a mental picture of how the project will go, right?

28:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And for instance, this is a very common situation.

28:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you're doing a project that you need like a designer and a programmer and maybe a guy that works in the accounting department, each one of them thinks about the project in very different ways.

28:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And if you don't do the project planning, each guy will think that the other guy is thinking like them.  like the designers like oh every work has revisions for sure the accountants work has revisions and maybe the accountants like everything happens on the spreadsheet of course the designer will send you very structured information so we don't have that problem because it's just you and I and I think we think in compatible ways but by putting your imagination on how the project will happen by putting it on paper we can make conscious decisions on what to do what not to do and stuff like that okay okay okay i like that so it's because i'm thinking you know i get back from Costa Rica the 15 something like that

30:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the 45th and the dates how is your December yeah so I've made a schedule here also to have some ideas for that so I'll be traveling to Portugal again on the 9th and I'll be there from the 9th of December until until February but it's just a matter of time zones but we can still work of course we will be further apart so maybe we need to shift stuff to the morning or stuff like that if that works with you in December I try out so travel on the 27th and I come back on the 9th of January and that's like my holiday so I won't take my

31:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And maybe wait, let me just share a screen of like the the calendar I have in mind.

31:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I think it's going to be easier Okay, okay, so all news on WhatsApp Okay, okay, okay. Open this.  Oh, no. Wait, just a second. This is not doing the thing I wanted to do. You Okay, now now we're talking Yes, I will show my screen now so share this tab, okay This do you see the calendar?  Yes? Okay, so we are here This is you in Costa Rica, right?

32:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes Okay, did you do that just now I?

32:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did it before and then I added your Costa Rica stuff now and So this is me traveling to Portugal and What I thought was that I didn't know that you had the Costa Rica what I have planned was two sessions maybe on this week The like the two planning sessions on the same week.  So it's just shorter Doing one hour a Single three-hour session. I don't think it works, but we don't need to do them like space the week so we can do like in consecutive days and Then these circles are the project sync ideas that I had You  like possible dates for the project C, OK? Yeah, this is what I had in mind. Now that we have the Costa Rica stuff.

33:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I can do that. I can do Tuesday. This one?

33:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The third?

33:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I can do one Tuesday, yes. OK. OK.

33:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Marker.

33:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So we can start with the, can we start first with the planning sessions and let's see how we deal with that and if, like, if it's possible to move to the project thinking.  But I want to first, you know, like, do the planning and, you know, OK?

33:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Of course, of course.

33:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Absolutely.

33:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first one to be on the third and the other one would be. I have a space in the second.

34:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Monday 2nd and Tuesday the 3rd. I think I don't know if that it's better than working until I get back because when I'm in Costa Rica I'm full day on the retreat.  Yeah, I imagine, I imagine.

34:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also I imagine like you are in a different mind space so it's... Yes, you know. So let me just pick something to see my availability on Monday.  Okay. makes no sense. Tell me about your availability on Monday.

34:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What would be better for you?

34:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

34:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Right now I have the 9am and I could do more Monday same time. And I'm on to 2 p.m.  You know like from now for hours five hours.

  I have more time this okay in that case we can do between 2 and 4 let's do that okay so the set that is important you give katoran and the same are you talking in Portuguese yeah yeah sometimes when I'm counting I  I usually do that. OK, so cool. We have two dates. can send you a starting, just to lock things into position.  Part of here, planning, one. And then I'll do more detail to this. OK. And the second one is intercepting the null.  I prefer to send this right away so you can see in your calendar. If I made any mistake, you can correct me immediately.

38:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK. Of course, you can send it.

38:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. I just send it. Cool. Very well.

39:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  so okay so i'll say i'll schedule this stuff um i take it that okay you are saying yes to the to the first one to the project planning yes well let's see because it my 2 p.m 3 p.m and the other one is show me at 11 a.m yes let me see yes i got both i know that you travel on uh wednesday yes is it a morning fight or an afternoon fight it's wednesday at 12 what i need to travel with car first to cancun that it's a four hour perhaps i need to leave like at uh in early early morning  in the Tuesday and then I'm out.

  Tuesday is good. I fly it for Wednesday. Yes, yes.

40:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
