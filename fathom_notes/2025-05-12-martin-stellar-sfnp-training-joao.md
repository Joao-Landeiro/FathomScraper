  How have you been?

0:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. And you?

0:03 - Martin Stellar
  This meeting is being recorded. Very good indeed.

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice.

0:08 - Martin Stellar
  Interesting things happening. How was your homework?

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't have too much opportunity to put it in place in terms of business stuff. But yeah, I've been doing something like that.  For a little, for a while, which is to really think about the conversations I have in the sense of how they felt for the other person.  And sometimes even take it as a game. Like when I'm talking to someone that I'm usually not, I don't have too much in common.  I've been trying for months now to... ... ... ... Make a game out of it. Like, I'll find something interesting about this person and just keep on asking stuff from them.  And sometimes it goes a little bit overboard. Like, I remember the other day I was at the barbecue. And I'm friends with the host.  But we are not very alike in any way. And it was, you know, I don't know much about barbecues, which is like, it's whole thing here in Brazil.

1:26 - Martin Stellar
  You're from Portugal. How do you not know about grilling meat?

1:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but it's a different level. I don't think you understand how serious these guys take it. No, I'm not joking.  This guy was talking about spending a thousand euro on meat for barbecue. And this is like, they have money, but they're not that kind of rich.  And it's like a thousand euro a month for meat. So it's a different level of dedication.

1:54 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah.

1:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I was like, I mean, I'm intrigued about that, but not. I don't don't No. To the level that I was talking about.  And I was like, okay, so what do you like about this meat? Oh, I like it because so-and-so. Okay, what makes it good to grill?  You know, these kind of things. And at some point, I think I was a little bit creepy because on the third question that I asked, like, and what does it make this knife such a good knife for barbecue?  And the guy never thought about it, right? It was like, oh, it's heavy and cuts good. I was like, okay, I think I'm stepping into the weird zone.  This is to say that I think the exercise is very valid. I didn't have much opportunity to do it in terms of sales, but I do it in my personal life.

2:37 - Martin Stellar
  Well, that is good because the point of these exercises, in most cases, is for general development of your ability to relate to people.  You're going to be able to apply it in the sales context, obviously, when it's there. But the trick is to practice this at any time that you can.  In fact, an exercise like, how well did I actually really listen? Back there. That's something that you can take with you until the end of your life and always make it a kind of a litmus test for yourself.  Like, was I in full integrity and paying attention to this other person? And the more you do that outside of your business context, the more it's going to influence also in your business context.  It's a life skill, really.

3:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. Yeah, for sure.

3:28 - Martin Stellar
  Hmm. Okay. Right. So today we're looking at questions. Because questions are the answer. A lot of people who are into selling, and this is including the actual professionals, they think that it's all about the pitch.  And then you have to go and make a pitch deck, and you have to figure out how to deliver a pitch in such a strong and compelling way that the other person is going to go, A people going  That is exactly what I needed. Take my money. How do we start? No convincing argument, no pitch, no compelling reasoning is ever as good as a thought-provoking question.  Questions are the answer. If you ask questions in the right way, you cause quality conversations. You cause what I call a breakthrough conversation.  Quality is very much a key word here. Quality in all aspects of your life. So when I go through my house and organize things, I try to do a quality job.  I like to have things in a specific place. I like to have a certain kind of design and order in where my stuff is and my art and my books.  There is a level of completeness, quality in how I experience my surroundings and how I configure it to create the best surrounding.  Quality is something that shows up not... Just in the work that you do, or in the perfectionism, in how you write your proposal and dot the T's and cross the I's, cross the T's and dot the I's.  Quality is there in everything that you do, if you do it right. It's in how you dress, it's in how you do your hair, it is in how you listen, it is in how you ask questions.  And the more you focus on creating a quality experience for people, the easier it is for this person to start relating to you, to start participating with you in that sales process.  And when that happens, then they are experiencing a breakthrough conversation. So your goal with questions is to create that kind of breakthrough conversation.  A quality conversation based on questions. And my notes are here. Thank you. you. You First thing to know when you're in a sales conversation, sales situation, really, is that you are already meant to be the leader of the process.  When somebody buys from you, you have your curriculum, you have your models, you have your frameworks, and you are leading their process because that's what they paid you for, right?  That leadership starts before they buy from you. You, as the seller, have a duty, an obligation, to make sure that people who should buy from you, buy from you.  Not later, not next year, now. And that they buy from you and not from somebody else if you are the best choice for them.  This is a moral and ethical duty that we have as a seller to make sure that if they should buy from me, I have to make sure that they do.  To do whatever I can. And that puts you in a position of leadership. You need to help them figure out whether or not you are right for them.  And you do that by applying an attitude of stewardship. You are a steward over the process to get them to making the right decision.  Be that to buy, to not buy, to buy something else, to buy at a later time. But the buyer needs to get to a decision.  And you are the steward of the process that gets them the vision and the clarity that enables them to make that decision.  So as you step into a sales dynamic and a sales conversation, you get to play a very fun game in that you get to constantly learn more about this person in order to know what it is you need to say.  So to get them to a decision, to get them to clarity, you need to say things to them and you can say the things that they do.  Right? Because your buyer, when you ask questions, obviously, will tell you exactly what they need you to say. So there is an ongoing process of trying to extract intel and insight from them with your questions.  And you do that in leading their process with questions. Because the person asking the questions, that's always the one who leads.  This is what makes it so different from traditional selling, where it is a game of coming at them with such force and enthusiasm and conviction that the pitch does the heavy lifting.  No, we don't lead by brute force. We lead by gently asking them question after question after question. People respond really well to that.  And it also causes people to open up and to start giving you more information. They're going to give you messaging.  They're going to give you insights. For instance, somebody might say, yeah, well, we've tried courses before, and we like your stuff, and we think it would really work.  But there are some people in the team who think that it's actually going to be a mistake. Okay, now you have a data point.  Now you have some intel that you can get back to later on, for instance, by saying, hey, let me roll back a moment to what you said earlier on, that there are some stakeholders who might not believe.  Is that something to address? Is that something I can help you with? Why do you think they think that way?  So now you're asking questions about the challenge they have in their world with other people. Again, showing leadership, but also using their intel to inform the conversation about what really matters to them, the challenges they have.

9:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this a Mexican standoff?

9:59 - Martin Stellar
  Is this a Mexican For you to see if you want to let this settle, or if you want to ask something.

10:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, this makes... You see me say this a lot, which is like, it makes sense. I know it intellectually, but I struggle with living this, right?  And the logic of, you know, the overarching effect of quality really speaks to me. The questions are the answer.  I like it on every sense of the expression. Sales is leadership is also something that I didn't know before, but I think when I went through the rabbit hole of your website, was like, yeah, sure, yeah, of course.  And it makes sense. It also connects with my discomfort, historical discomfort, with being in leadership positions. And I understand that these are probably like other things I need to work on.  But... And... They all relate. And I also like the idea of steward or stewardship. Even when we talk about leadership, the idea of a servant leader has always appealed to me.  So I see the connection between this. The person asking the questions is the one who leads, which in visual facilitation, there's the idea that the one that holds the whiteboard marker is leading the conversation.  So it's kind of similar, makes a lot of sense to me. So yeah, sure. We are on this. I'm following you.  I have some questions, but they're not about other things. So we can just work on this stuff now.

11:46 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Good. What most people do is they come at a person with... very compelling argumentation. And the most frequent and common response to that is, I'll let you know, which is terrible, because that basically is synonym, it's code for OA, which is what you do with salespeople.  And so the thing that makes Sales for Nice People different, and that makes it an enjoyable process for the seller as well as the buyer, is that we're here to serve.  Selling is an act of service, because you need to make a decision about solving this problem or not solving this problem.  For you to make a decision, you need to have a vision of the outcome. And that means you need to have clarity on the pros and cons and what will happen and what won't happen if you solve this problem or if you don't solve this problem.  And to get you to that clarity, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions. Does that sound fair?  Now you're asking for permission. Like you saw, permission is the fundamental starting point of Sales for Nice People. When you ask people, can I ask you some questions?  Does it sound fair? Can I help you get some clarity around what to do with this pesky problem that you have?  You get permission. You now get to extract even more information. You get to gather even more info. So then you, instead of going for compelling arguments, you go for the highest quality questions that you can find.  And then you get a very different reaction. Then people tell you, tell me more. How does it work? Could you help us as well?  Because you are making the process something of a collaboration. Thank you. So instead of trying to convince people, it says for nice people, you don't convince, you don't use compelling arguments, you don't try to persuade, because persuasion just says, no, you didn't get it, you're wrong, let me make you right.  But if I am right, then I'm making the other person wrong, and nobody likes to be made wrong, and your buyer leans out.  And that's why you don't do the convincing, the persuading, or the compelling argumentation. You ask quality questions. For instance, last week, I was talking to a new lead.  It was very interesting, because he sent me a message afterwards, saying, yeah, you ask some really good questions, I like that, I like your questions, but some of them were also kind of odd.  Well, I think I know which one he's talking about, because I asked him, what is your favorite flavor kryptonite?  Which is an odd question, obviously. But for somebody who is a coach, with a lot of knowledge about psychology, and who works with...  Leadership and wants to move from tech founders to Fortune 500 leaders. Well, he better be aware of his own Achilles heel.  If he doesn't know how he tends to typically sabotage himself, he's probably going to do it right in my face.  That's not what I want. So I want him to stop and think about his own preferred way of self-sabotage.  How do you sap your strength? That was a very strange question for him. Gave me a lot of intel.  For instance, he came back to me saying, yeah, your questions are strange. Now, that tells me something about how he thinks.  So at every point of the interaction, I'm gathering insight that helps me learn my people. It helps me better understand what this person is about, what they're like, how they react to things.  He's shown up in the first message with a Loom video before, you know, when he scheduled a call. When he was all smiley and, hey, Martin, I like your stuff and I need some help with this thing.  And that thing, and was very friendly, very smart, showed up. Meeting the same way, but in the message that he sent afterwards, he said, yeah, I didn't feel the kind of energy that I was hoping for.  I didn't walk away energized like I've done in the past from coaching conversations. Okay, that's interesting. Again, that is a data point that now goes into a meeting with him on Wednesday.  So, does it matter that you feel a certain type of energy? What was missing that made you not have that kind of feeling?  What would be required from this conversation for you to have that feeling of being energized? So I can use that little data point to feed into my process of inquiry and trying to understand something.  Everything is data. Okay. You put all those pieces together, you synthesize that into a better, higher resolution map of what this person is like.  Because when he showed up, it was just Joe with a Loom video and a booking for tomorrow. And that was my map of Joe.  I looked at his website, so now I could include that in my map of Joe, but still, that is a heuristic with a level of abstraction that doesn't even get you to the end of the street.  In terms of a map, it is useless. But every time that he tells me something, my map gets a little bit more complete, refined, tweaked.  It becomes a higher resolution. And that is the whole point of this conversation, that you continuously improve the resolution of your map.  Now, the most useful question that you can ask someone is the question that makes them think. Most of the time, we ask questions just because we want to get a confirmation of something or we want some insight.  And that's very nice and that can be very useful and sometimes it's necessary. you. you. But when you are talking to somebody who's thinking about buying from you, you need that person to process what your work is going to do for them.  There is a number of things that they need to think about. Does it justify the expense? Is it really what we should be doing?  Is it the right direction to go in in the first place? Will it get us an ROI? What is the wife going to say?  There's all kinds of things that they need to think about. You get to influence what they think about by asking specific questions.  So if you ask, hey, is this a now thing or a later thing? Well, that's good. That's useful. Now you get them to think about, should we hurry with this or should we take it slowly?  But by itself, that question is pointless. If you connect that question to, well, I'm asking because I often see that people who kick this off kick themselves six months or 12 months later.  Because when they find the build course, they're... Realize the enormous leverage that it has. So now you're making your buyer think about leverage and where that fits into their timeline.  You're making them think about something important. Then there is the kind of question that gives you permission, which is a recurring theme.  Is it okay if I ask you a few questions about this? You said something there and there. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about that trouble or challenge or past experience?  I see something here that might be useful. I could create a custom program. Would you like me to explain a little bit how that would work?  Sure. All these questions give you permission. And that permission is necessary because it implies that they are adopting you into their mental space.  And that's another reason why you want to... Questions that make people think. Because a buyer has a conversation going on in their head about their problem and the challenge and how to solve it and when.  And that conversation has been going on for weeks or months or more. But when the conversation ends, what are they going to be thinking about?  They might be thinking about your competitor who sent them a 70-page slide deck. That would suck because now they're living with your competitor in their head, not you.  But if you ask pesky questions, the kind that make people think, then when you're not in the room with them, they're going to continue thinking about the questions that you ask.  They're going to make you part of the conversation that's in their head. So you'll be living rent-free in their head.  And that enables them to build up the case for talking to you again, for maybe buying for you. So you become part of the conversation going on in their head by asking.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The right question. Is this your meta strategy on your videos?

21:09 - Martin Stellar
  Certainly more.

21:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I found you through the videos, right? And the videos are quick. They also, I think, play to your strengths.  Yeah. Really powerful presence.

21:29 - Martin Stellar
  Thank you.

21:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My pleasure. And I think I've mentioned this. But also, I can really see these videos putting living rent-free in a lot of people's minds, right?  Like, I don't know how quickly is the process usually for you to close somewhat. But I felt that I arrived pretty much ready to your pipeline, right?  Yeah. So basically, this is kind of a parenthesis. But... But... But... you. So is this kind of one of the things of the videos?  It makes sense that it is. It's impossible if it isn't.

22:07 - Martin Stellar
  No, no, it is. It is. Everybody has a sales problem or everybody has a sales goal. And the people who have a problem and want to solve that, yeah, look, there are dozens and dozens and dozens of people who can solve those problems.  You see them in your DMs every day.

22:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can generate unlimited leads, pay-on results, blah, blah, blah. Actually, I don't get much of those.

22:32 - Martin Stellar
  I don't mind not getting them. I'll sign you up to a couple of lists. No, never mind.

22:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it's crazy that I know what people mean, but it doesn't have another bunch of them. Anyway, okay, okay.  Let's just recap this real quick. Okay. So today we're talking about questions and we've been speaking about different kinds of questions.  Some of them are better than others or they have more potential. So maybe potential energy asking for permission, we've been, you know, touching on this several times, which I think is important to keep touching on it several times.  It gets more, more granularity on it every time we mention it. Okay. And now about questions. I have a question about questions.  Do you have some sort of, like, a helper taxonomy of questions? Like, have these three types of questions in mind?  Because as I get more natural at this, I understand that I'll just develop my own, and pick my favorite ones.  Like, the examples you gave, they are very good at illustrating this. And I'm like, oh, I need to write this down.  But I know that's not really about writing this down. But at the same time, I'm like, oh, I don't want to forget these questions afterwards, because there's a, yeah.  to to forget it.

24:00 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah.

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go ahead.

24:00 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah. Yeah, good one. Let me make a note of that. Auxomony of questions, and put that into my EA project, because she's going to have thoughts.

24:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is always a she, right?

24:23 - Martin Stellar
  You bet. She is actually a she.

24:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She is not an AI. I thought it was an AI.

24:33 - Martin Stellar
  Oh, no, no, no.

24:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  EA. EA, yeah, that's true.

24:37 - Martin Stellar
  An actual EA. And she is a she, and she is, well, someone very nice, and she thinks the same about me.  Nice. So there's that.

24:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you ask me how my week?

24:49 - Martin Stellar
  Interesting. Auxomony of questions is a really good idea. I've never taken the time for that. that. But that's not going to come out in the next couple of days or weeks.  Let's see. Actually, I might have something close enough. Let me check. See if can find that. No, no, that's going to be too much of a search for now.  I'll follow up with you on that. So there is a category of questions that are vision-based, that are designed for people to...  Take a different perspective on things. A question like that could be, what if that problem were an advantage? Or what if you were no longer allowed to give trainings?  What would you do? What if this were the best thing that could have happened to you? So this is a challenge or problem.  What if the upshot, what if it fails to pay off? And the upshot that you think you're going to get isn't there.  So these are questions where you're taking a subject, a topic, a problem, a challenge, a plan, and you go, let's look at it from a different side.  So shift in perspective questions. And there are questions that... This is actually really good. It's funny that you, with your specialism, are now triggering me to improve a component of my own things.

27:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I think it's fair that they also have a little bit of rent-free. You've been living rent-free for a while.

27:26 - Martin Stellar
  That's all.

27:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We are house-swapping now. But okay.

27:34 - Martin Stellar
  So you have vision-based questions, then you have permission-based questions. Is it okay? Could you tell me? Does this sound fair?  Then there's a category of counterintuitive questions. Would it be a bad idea to meet again and discuss what this would look like?  Or how to make it work? Um, fun one where you have a conversation with somebody, but it's not really advancing, but there's good rapport.  You know, you can do crazy counterintuitive things like, so what if you would send me 10,000 pounds today? You know, you say that with a smile, and you're just cracking a joke, but you're also opening a door.  So, and I once said it to a buyer, I think I was talking to an owner and his two co-directors or something like that.  And at some point, I'm like, hey, Jimmy, just a question. Can I borrow your Ferrari? The room fell silent, and everybody started laughing, like, well, no, of course not.  I don't even have a Ferrari. Right, okay, but now we can at least continue talking about whatever, payment and terms of logistics.  So I used that very weird. Our question to break the ice, to cause a pattern interrupt, so you can ask questions that are very counterintuitive, that it was often also a change in perspective, change in vision kind of question.  There are future base questions, so there you get a nice little psychological kung fu stack that I'm going to use.  What will happen if you solve this? What will not happen if you solve this? What will happen if you don't solve this?  And what will not happen if you don't solve this? So by using the stacked negatives on top of each other in different formats, you force a buyer to go through all kinds of scenarios, future basing themselves into what path A and path B.

30:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Future-based or pace?

30:03 - Martin Stellar
  Pace, pace, future pace. So future pacing is what they typically call the before and after. Okay. When you go to the gym, that's the before, you're 70 pounds overweight.  The after is you're ripped and you're walking down the beach with your tank topple. So before and after. It's very superficial, but future pacing people and having them place themselves six months or two years into the future as the beneficiary of a change that they purchased, well, that can be very helpful because they see themselves not from here projecting outwards.  No, they imagine themselves there as having had all these changes happen.

30:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

30:48 - Martin Stellar
  Go ahead. I'll go deeper into the questions and send you some. I'll go deeper into the questions. You I have a set somewhere that I think you will find useful.  I'll follow up with that. Okay, so another thing, yeah, that's another category of questions. That is the why questions.  Are you familiar with Toyota's five whys?

31:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

31:25 - Martin Stellar
  Right. So the question of why is it important to get this change or this outcome is very, very powerful.  Because people tend to show up with a superficial kind of explanation. Yeah, we need a sales coach to come in and do some training because our sales team needs to go from 12 million to 14 million.  Yeah, and why is that important? Well, it's important because we have to, you know, costs are going up and we've had some churn.  And our profitability is down, so we just need to invoice more. Yeah, but what is important about invoicing more?  Well, if we don't, we don't get to sell enough product and make enough difference in people's lives. And why do you want to make a difference in people's lives?  Well, because our founder, God bless his soul, he passed away five years, established this organization in order to make sure that kids get shoes to go to school with in Africa.  Oh, so it's not that you want to sell more charity seats and raise funds for your project. You want to make sure that kids go to school with shoes on.  That's the real reason why. When you are able to dig down, you know, with those five whys into what is actually the core motivation, the core reason and driver and the purchase motivator, the conversation then becomes anchored around what is the...  Will reason instead of the superficial. When you are talking to a buyer about, so in your case, would be a training, okay, let's play the game.  You're the buyer and I'm João. And you show up and you go, how does this work? What would you want?  I don't know, what are you looking for?

33:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I want to have, it's strange to me. So I want people to see how much of an expert I am.

33:40 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. And you are an expert in a certain field?

33:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

33:47 - Martin Stellar
  What is that going to do for you when you are seen as an expert? What is it going to change?  What is it going to enable?

33:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, it's going to make my... High school reunion, less awkward, and we'll, yeah, I'll make more money.

34:14 - Martin Stellar
  You make more money. What's important about making more money?

34:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Arriving at the high school reunion in a better car. Yeah, it just...

34:28 - Martin Stellar
  And why is that important? What is there at this high school reunion that makes you want to deliver that impression?

34:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I want to prove them that I was not weird, I was early.

34:48 - Martin Stellar
  Why do you want to prove that? What is there to prove about not being weird?

34:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um... does it that Um... Um... Because they made me feel weird and I want them to go to sleep thinking where they  up.

35:09 - Martin Stellar
  So actually you want to buy my training because it's going to be instrumental in setting the record straight with people who depreciated you when you were small.  Okay. I cannot promise that you will have the money to drive a better car, but if you buy my training, you will put the record straight.  Because once you're going through my program and you've built your own training, then anybody who sees your stuff will recognize that you are the expert.  And you'll be able to set the record straight not only with the  and the bullies in school, but also with your audience.  So now we're talking not about making money and not about making money. Impression at the high school reunion. Now we are retroactively fixing our public image.  That is the actual reason why you would want to buy João's training. You guys got me wrong. You misunderstood me.  I want to show you how things really are. When you bring your buyer to that depth of motivation, your whole conversation changes.  Because it's no longer about getting the direct result. You're not talking about that result is going to do in the larger picture of their life.  That is the real motivation.

36:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. Parentheses here. This is really interesting. Those things have been as well, of course. But this is really interesting because one of my hang-ups is, and we've spoken about this, is the tension between productizing.  Promising a result and, you know, or a process, even promising the process is difficult. We spoke about this. Okay.  By going deeper into the psyche, I guess, we step away from the pure results ROI kind of thinking and we have a different kind of conversation where the spreadsheet mind doesn't really work.  So I'm free to have a more holistic view on these things. Right. So I'm restating this to you as I understood it.  Okay. Yeah, that feels very useful for that sort of hang up.

  My friend Mary, the business consultant, the family business consultant, she talks about the bus. So very often she will get an inquiry.  So here you may have two brothers who are the third generation business owner and And now the kids are getting ready to take over.  In the next five years, the brothers are going to be out, retired, and the kids will be the new owners.  Oh yeah, we want to turn this into an employee-owned company. Okay, can you help us? Maybe. But why is that?  Well, because our cousins are doing it as well. We've seen employee-owned companies all over the place, and that's really cool.  We want to make a statement, and we want to be a B Corp. Yeah, but what's important about that?  People very often show up with an idea and a plan, but they don't really know what they're asking for.  They don't know what it would do for them. They don't know what would be the drawbacks. They don't know what the cost of getting it done would be on a personal level.  So they have this idea. We need to know. Ownership charter. Family charter. Okay, why? What's that supposed to do for you?  You're talking about weeks and weeks of design and then there's lawyers involved and we want to build a family fund.  Why? So you come to me and you say we have this bus, we want to buy a bus and then we want to all go somewhere together.  Okay, but what kind of bus? Who is on the bus? Who is driving the bus? Where's the bus going to go?  Why does the bus have to go there? There's a whole bunch of reasons. How much fuel are you going to need?  Are you going to bring luggage? What about petrol? Like you can tell me that you want to go to this place on that bus, but unless you have clarity on why in the first place it's a good idea to get on a bus and go somewhere together, I'm not going to be able to sell you anything.  Figuring out what is the underlying root cause of the desire, the fundamental purchase motivator, is fundamental. Because it completes the picture for them, it completes the vision that they need.  It adds clarity, and it has them identify throughout the conversation with the most fundamental reasons to purchase change. That sets you apart from all the other providers, because all the other providers just go, here's the thing, here's all the bullet points with benefits and the future and the outcomes, and can you now just pay me already, and then we can get started.  And you're like, no, no, no, I'll send you a payment link if and when we get to an agreement that it's a good idea.  First, I have a couple of questions. Why is this actually important? And if a buyer is not willing to engage with those questions, and they go like, yo, we just want to make more money, what's the point of these questions?  Then I probably cannot help you, because so far, the people who don't have a definition of why it is important to make more money, tend to end up not buying.  And if they do, they tend to not do much with the program, because in the end... They just want to make more money, and if they don't make it instantly with this, they're going to go somewhere else and see if that makes them the money.  I'm not interested in that. So, asking questions like this, without having to get weird about barbecue nights, you know, you do have to read your room.  It strengthens the bond. It creates a stronger dynamic where they open and trust you more, and by not trying to move towards a sale directly, they're going to keep giving you more intel.  All of that together ends up with people going, how does it work, where do we start? Got it. When you do that, you get to calibrate your discourse and your messaging based on what they tell you.  know you've know, just like talk we'll And you then, one important question is, which questions will help your buyer get the insight and the clarity they need to make a confident decision?  So that is a question for you. That's how you test yourself. Am I asking the right questions? What questions do they need to hear from me, to develop the clarity that they need to make a confident decision?
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/aCAQVsWHWirKuwu7zJPqsvm2xahhkgxP?timestamp=2574.221119  Now then, these are the actual... If you give me just a moment, I'll be back in just a minute to make a quick pit stop while you look at these.  Thank Thank So to review conversations that you've had, it's all very natural and inconspicuous, right? You don't have to get notepad about it, but you ask yourself in a conversation or afterwards, like, okay, what actually was the relevant data in Intel that I got?  Which questions got me that? Where did I forget to ask something? And should I go back to ask that question?  Because very often you'll realize that you had a great sales conversation and you have maybe your next steps defined, or maybe you haven't,  Or maybe you need to follow up. Well, one of the questions that you didn't ask are a great way, a great excuse to go back to people.  Was I able to have the other person see different points of view or think about things? How good of a quality conversation was this actually?

45:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

45:45 - Martin Stellar
  Okay.

45:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I have some questions.

45:52 - Martin Stellar
  Mm-hmm.

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  was about So I'm not getting on many calls, right? And I think this is affecting the iteration loop on what I'm learning.  And I know this is not really about prospecting, but there's an element of that. And I know that's a bigger thing.  Do you have... So I add people and I comment and sometimes I go and engage specifically with people that make good comments on stuff that I've posted.  Seems to work up to a point. In the short time that we have, is there a thing that you've noticed in your experience that had for you an outsized effect on starting more conversations?  So this is not about the theory. It's about a real story from you that's like, you know what? This one thing was really powerful.  Because I can read it.

47:03 - Martin Stellar
  For me, going to networks, network events with the purpose of making friends works really well. So the kind of networking event where it's all about handing out business cards and it's a, you know, after the talk, there's a half an hour network.   it, I'm not going. I'm not interested. But if there is a entrepreneur walk or a breakfast meetup or an after party after the conference, yeah, I'll go there because then I get to hang out.  can get to mingle through a room, walk with different people, have conversations, make friends. And that inevitably always ends up with sales conversations, sometimes quickly, sometimes it takes a while.  But to have no agenda other than meeting cool people really works really. On a more focused action. I've done outreach, which has worked really well.  And I've done that with cold calling. Not so much, but I've done it a few times. I have done outreach campaigns where I would simply go, hey, listen, people like you often, I don't know if this is relevant and applies, but people like you often tend to struggle with the sales part of business.  And I help ethical entrepreneurs sell more and still sleep at night. Would it make sense to have a conversation?  And I would get a good amount of replies, like 30, 40% of people would reply to me, and then half of those would call, and some of them would buy.  I've also done customer interviews where you get a much higher response rate and where people sometimes also end up becoming a client.  In fact, I... Remember, I was introduced to someone when I was developing the system, a very good friend who would help me with design and things like that.  She said, oh, you should talk to Zoe. So, hey, Zoe, Paula says I should talk to you. I'm doing some research to get product market fit, customer interviews.  Would you mind 20 minutes so that I can ask you a couple of questions? And I met with her, and it took 10 minutes to draw the diagram and show her the 16-level things, a very, very top-level explanation.  And I said, if I built this into a training, would that be something you would consider? And she goes, yes, take my money.  And two days later, she sent me a down payment. So this was somebody who was not looking for sales help necessarily, maybe in the back of her mind, who knows, but she didn't reach out.  It was not a sales conversation because you cannot. And present to do an interview and then turn it into a sales conversation.  But it became a sales conversation because she made it one. She volunteered the sale. I was doing interviews. You cannot ethically pivot an interview into a sales pitch.  At best, you can say, if and when this is ready, would you like me to? Or you can say, given your response to this, you might find it handy, useful to read some more information.  Would you like me to send you a PDF afterwards? Well, that's about the ethical extent that you can go to, in my opinion.  So it was just an interview. And she said, take my money. And she became a student. And I think there might be some real terrain for you to cover in doing that.  Because not only does it, in some cases, cause somebody to turn into a buyer or a lead, let's say.  You also get an enormous amount of information. Okay. you. Thank About who to talk to and who to ignore.  A lot of the problems with the sales pipeline is that we are talking to people that we shouldn't be talking to in the first place.  Because we don't have criteria that tell us ignore people like that.

51:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. Thank you. Other questions? I get a sense that it's also something I've mentioned before. And I get a little bit stuck on it.  Not a little bit. I I get stuck in it. Which is the whole couple Couple of... So what happens is, in my perspective, is that I never use the slides.  I don't even have slides. I have some older slides. And in a sense, I think that this is good because it shifts the conversation into a more data gathering and so on.  But also, I feel that because I'm at this beginner level of the data gathering thing, I don't get the benefits of structure that the presentation could give me.  But at the same time, I'm not yet at the point where my data collection is so good that it doesn't matter, right?  So it's very annoying that just by phrasing the question, I see the answer.

52:49 - Martin Stellar
  But anyway, I wanted to make use of What is the answer?

52:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I need, like, three slides.

52:55 - Martin Stellar
  Do you?

52:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Come again?

52:58 - Martin Stellar
  Do you?

53:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Even if, yeah, I think it would help me.

53:10 - Martin Stellar
  It might, but it also might be a crutch.

53:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, absolutely, it is a crutch. I'm not saying...

53:24 - Martin Stellar
  I would, in fact, I would say at this stage, it might even be best for you to not have any slides for the first 10 or 20 conversations.  For you to be able to handle a buyer conversation, sales conversation, and make it be effective as well as fun, it's extremely important that you are very perceptive and that you continuously calibrate your messaging to where that person is at, at any given stage of the conversation.  That means you have to think on your feet, you have to be agile mentally, you have to be perceptive and observant, and the moment, for instance, you see somebody leaning out when you're making an important point, you have to register that and have to react to it on the spot, in the moment.  When you have your slides, you are being distracted by what you are going to try to communicate, that's a risk, and it might cause you to miss signals that people give you, verbally or non-verbal, and you are trying to figure out a complex, challenging thing, this whole sales thing, and you go, well, I don't have any slides, okay, that sounds like a crutch, but if I have three slides, that should be enough.  It was probably too much. What would be required of you to have a quality conversation that potentially leads to a sale?  Without having any slides.

55:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Perfect. So I'm not going to do the trick of responding with a question, but this relates to my other question.

55:08 - Martin Stellar
  Okay.

55:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you'll see the connection right away. Okay. Which is, again, the tension of... Okay. So because of the way I think, the way I work, my skill set, I tend to do mostly customized stuff, right?  Which is somewhat ironic. But anyway, it is what it is. And... But I don't like... I want to step out of it.  I want to step into at least a more, you know, defined kind of arena. And these kind of conversations that we're talking about, to me, they make a lot of sense for these, you know, services things.  you? Yeah, thanks. Jack! It's that they have a certain degree of adaptability. I want to... So, thinking out loud, I'm mindful of the time, and I'm really trying to phrase this in a way that's not silly.  It's not difficult for me, I think, to find opportunities to do valuable things for people. Okay, that's not difficult.  The difficult part is framing that in a way where I'm not... Well, you're in Spain. Sancho Panza, because I think I have this tendency of being a good right-hand person.  I noticed that in myself. But I don't want to be... Everyone makes fun of Sancho Panza, so we know how it goes.  And... And so, in terms of the sale, like, I can find opportunities... Thank you. It is to be useful and valuable to these people that relate to their challenges.  My challenge right now is connecting that to specific things I want to do for them, right? Okay. So. This kind of, it's not the right word, but you'll, pardon me, this kind of script is really good for, you know, this opportunistic kind of thing.  Like, oh, yeah, I see that. I go there, right? But if I have a specific thing that I'm trying to sell them, like a specific program, I need to adapt it.  Because that's what you did with me. You have a specific program and you sold it to me, right? But in my very black and white binary mind, it's difficult to connect these two things, you know?  Yeah. So I'm counting on your expertise.

58:00 - Martin Stellar
  It's did. Good. Extract the question out of this. Yes, sir. The question that you're asking is effectively how do I ask the kinds of questions that obviate slides?  So here is a checklist, well, a set reader. If all you do is pick and choose questions from this list, you're going to be just fine.  And, you know, there's a lot of sub-questions in it, and I'm going to create a PDF that holds all of it.  But if you do nothing but asking these questions, you will identify what are the most important things. And then instead of having slides, what I would do is get up my iPad and say, all right, challenge number one is this, challenge number two is this, and challenge number three is this.  Is that correct? correct? correct? right back. Yes. Now, if we summarize them all, then the main problem to solve is we want to get this accomplished.  Prove the bullies wrong. Did I get that right? Okay. Then we have problem one, problem two, problem three, summary.  We have three options to solve that. We can either go lightweight, do it yourself. We can do it done with you, or we can do it done for you.  Which of these three do you think is the best starting point of our next conversation? No slides? No presentation?  No preparation? Simply defining what's meaningful, recapping that in a single statement, and then three options. Where do you want to go next?  Who needs slides? I do have to jump off now. Yeah, sure.

59:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So thank you for the substitute of the one.

59:51 - Martin Stellar
  All right. Talk to me in Slack.

59:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we'll.

59:54 - Martin Stellar
  Thank you. Have a nice day. Good. Thank you. See you. Thank
