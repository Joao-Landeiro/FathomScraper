0:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I was just thinking I saw the email from Stryce and they had one on Slack, I don't know if you're on that, where they're asking that we don't share the policies with third parties and I'm wondering why he said that maybe because you have a different email address, like would it be possible if you use a fortify email address if we gave you one so it looks like that you're from fortify I don't know how easy it would be to like use an outlook or to use.  Otherwise we have like do some kind of like then I can respond and be like okay no but we have an NDA between like our third parties or blah blah blah blah blah.

0:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this is just about them asking is not to use that their their policies not make them visible to other companies.  I will just ask for clarification what they mean with third parties.

1:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because it could be like you guys are at third parties, you know, do you mean like like then because you guys are suppliers or kind of third parties and then like you're listed as external so then maybe they're that but it could be good to clarify that.  I could say oh we're working with a like Brazilian design team and there's third party and we have an FDA and we should check on that like around that with that and then go from there but it's more.

1:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean I'm happy to sign one but I don't remember if I've signed an FDA.

1:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I have no trouble with doing that but I don't know if we have because it's been a little bit nowhere is the contract with Mao so yeah we need to check that.  or figure something out if we're going to work longer term on this. So this company signed on before Christmas, so you probably haven't met them.  And they are a series D company, a really high-growth company, also kind of like Zeta. But this person is the CFO, so he's kind of responsible for this topic and kind of just wants to get it done, I think is my understanding.  And I think they want to focus on the G side, not the E side. Got it.

2:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So they're very different from the Acre guys.

2:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, these are the, no, they don't have any subject matter experts in this.

2:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're like the, they're like kind of the high-growth companies that are just kind of growing really fast, but they don't have any in-house specialty resources that know like, you know, the process.

2:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it. Okay, I think they're joining now.

3:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello.

3:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hey.

3:24 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Hi.

3:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you doing?

3:26 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Good to see you. Good.

3:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, be good yourself.

3:29 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Yeah, I'm doing all right.

3:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I want to say happy new year, but it's almost the end of the month.

3:38 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But yes, yeah, and I guess I could introduce Jao, I don't think you've met him, but he's part of the UX UI design team that's been helping us develop and design our product, which is ready, the first part of it is actually ready for launch and testing too.

3:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we'll discuss that with you today in the presentation. And so, yeah, that's where we are.

4:04 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I guess, you have a colleague, it?

4:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Lynn, I saw an invitation, is that? Yes, that's me.

4:12 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Lynn Head of Accounting started in January. Fairly new into the organization.

4:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  then do you need to kind of update Lynn or do you feel that we can just kind of jump right in?  I don't know how much you've been updated about what we're We can just jump right in, think.

4:33 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  OK, OK, great.

4:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I'll jump into the presentation that we made and we're actually doing this with all of the pilot customers this week or last week and just kind of planning for the kickoff and the testing and where you would need support in this process and to check on that.

4:49 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  the last time we met, I would say it's a little bit different with your team because we haven't really shown a lot of the design in the process.  Over the fall, had around our 12 pilot customers, including Cognite and Mazzanetta and Streis kind of look at our designs and get some feedback on it.

5:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Now we're at the point where you can actually click in and test it. So we had been showing them around the different processes around risk management third party and then we rebuilt the app from scratch in October because we had launched part of our app in Telenoar.  Telenoar itself is a very, I would say, specific kind of animal in terms of how they wanted their product so that we kind of reworked it in the fall so that it can be or scale up companies like you guys.

5:38 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  So we kind of rebuilt it in October and then this is what we're starting to launch in the next two weeks, part of the tool.

5:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So since then we've made more upgrades designed.

5:49 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  So the policies, trainings and communication portion of the tool is ready for testing and then we're going to build out the control section and then the rest of the tool and I'll go through

6:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and the presentation. So this is actually the new design of the of the tool and this part what you're seeing is what we're going to be launching on policies which is templates of policies either existing ones that you have that we can put into the tool so employees can sign off on them or policies that we create for you and then we put in the tool and that you could edit them and save them and have them and deploy them and it's the same thing for training for example we have a set up already of an anti bribery and corruption training from my understanding you guys will focus on the G side but we also have trainings for the east side like for environmental management also that are prefilled that you can also look at and deploy and then also communication that you want to send out to the organization quarterly we have templates of that also that you can use and just deploy and then employees would have access when you decide to deploy this fully would have access to this employee portal which would be a kind of a reminder of everything that they need to to do in terms of signing off on policy

7:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  signing off on training, completing the training and communication and later on this portal will be the same thing that's used in our control.

7:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So when you think about conflict of interest registers, expense registers, anything around that, that can be also within this tool too.  yeah, just a quick, yeah, a quick pause.

7:26 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  For us, the most, the interest for us is really on the easy side.

7:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My understanding was that we can use the tool to like help us get compliance with the CSRB framework and starting with like the global maturity assessment.

7:47 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  it really helps us on the compliance side of the team. We have a system in place for policies.

8:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We use, is it one trust? We push policies at the sign of employees already today, but I'm not sure if we have that's the best tooling.  We have considered if we should change it, but if that's the focus, I also need the compliance of the ISO team in the room.

8:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, yeah, so we like our launch we have different areas that we are kind of launching and I could maybe show you go back to the compliance map that kind of shows you all of the different areas and risk assessment is one and I think that like yes we can do a full material and that was kind of on the I would say we're launching this over the next month so like every two weeks we're launching a different part of it first is policies and then then controls are thinking with the next one is integrity hub

9:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  we could all third party management.

9:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We could also move risk assessment higher up for it.

9:05 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  the e-side is it is possible but also when you say like CSRD because CSRD also covers S and E.  So are you saying that you only need CSRD for the e-side or do you want CSRD for across E, S and G?  No, we might need, but the reason for the pause is that we have a trueling today in place for like the G-side.

9:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if the focus is to replace that, it could be that we need it.

9:45 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But that's also a link to our ISO audit process and so on. So if that's the key topic, then I would like to introduce a broad team to make that

10:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  decision or to see if this is the human.

10:03 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Okay.

10:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and I think that's fine.

10:05 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  we, like for example, we're working right now with Cognite on the E, like all the E policies, all the E training, all the E communication to launch that out to, or basing it off of the ISO 14001 standard, because that can also be linked to CSRD.  Because CSRD is your reporting on what they're actually doing, and ISO framework is a framework on actually doing it.  So we can do that same thing with you, and we have environmental policy templates that we can provide that are already created, and then the controls are on environmental management.  So that's not a problem, because you guys have a very similar setup in terms of these high-growth digital companies that we can kind of use as templates to launch those.

10:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's a possibility too, or that. So, but I would say that our tool could also just be, yeah, eventually, Runtress, I know, is quite expensive, so that we do a lot of the...

11:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  because OneTrust is a lot of enterprise customers use it.

11:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We're like probably a simplified OneTrust, and we work on the G side, but it's fine to start with the E too, because there are several companies that are only looking at the E and not the G.  I think I am mistaken that you wanted part of the G part of it, but we can also just do the test launch on E too.  So that's not a problem with that.

11:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The risk assessment and the reporting part, guess all of them would be applicable, or do we already report on what's covered within OneTrust?

11:36 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Yeah, I think OneTrust for us is more documentation than we send a survey and we like all employees sign up for like the ISO 24-27001, isn't that there is a top two audit really focused on the product and security part of the product.  That's documented for us in OneTrust, but I know we are not super happy with it.

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, that's the G-POD appeal that we have covered on the G-POD.

12:06 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I guess there's like G can be broken down in different areas, right?

12:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you think about OneTrust or like Vanta or Sprintote that do ISO 26001 and SOC2 compliance, which is the security and privacy part of it, which is what I think you're talking about because most companies have that.

12:22 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But what we look at is the ISO 37001, which is the anti bribery and corruption, actual love regulation around that aspect.

12:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So, that's what we're focusing on. So, it's a different focus, but that part of it can probably, I'm pretty sure, OneTrust has a governance section.  So, that can also be just added to your OneTrust.

12:40 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Or you can use ours with the E side for ES and G.

12:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And my guess is that we will come in lower than OneTrust, but I also understand if you've already put your stuff in OneTrust, you might just want to continue on with them.

12:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But we can also do, in the meantime, we can kind of do it based off of the E, the E side of it, like the E policies that you presented.

13:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  features, you know, the E and launch it in that. But it is a kind of a similar process where you have the risk assessment.  And I can say for you guys as a digital company, most likely your risk assessment on the E side will show that your digital cloud is probably your biggest, I would say impact on the E side, right?

13:18 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Because you guys don't have heavy assets or it's maybe some of your assets as in computers and recycling and electricity and the health.  So we've already kind of mapped this out for Cognite so we can kind of recognize that those are going to be probably similar to you.  And then we have controls in terms of how you monitor this, how you like, how you gather the information so that you can report on it within CSRD when the time comes.

13:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So that's kind of how we set it up there. So yeah, so that's kind of the process. So we are kind of launching kind of in separate pieces.  I kind of like, okay, first you have to have a policy and employees have to do a training kind of like the security part because that's CSRD is reporting on actions that you're doing.

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right, so these are like you then I'm bringing you through the actions of what you guys need to do and then you kind of report through that process But yeah Okay, is it does it match what you guys are thinking or is it?  Yeah, I I think it's useful But I this probably on my side.

14:20 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I'm just wondering with this scope if We should be more in the room on this side up because we have a Or we can do a follow-up up, but we have a Operations team and security team that owns many of these processes So If this scope should be or we should able like maybe replace one first Then I'm not the right person in the room to be honest You

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  or you can yeah yeah I think we do send surveys to employees so for us it's also should we add another system on top of one to send different service to different people in different so so it's more yeah around this and oversight and it's it's a bit immature so so yeah it's a fair point if you want to look at it holistically because I see a lot of so like unfortunately in larger organizations they're more siloed so like it will be they they have like separate separate systems and you guys have the opportunity where you're starting out where you can say okay this is only one system I want to use to implement this so that is a possibility but there are some like we see with strice strices using Vanta which is a system very similar to ours but very focused on security and privacy because they have different types of controls and follow-up than we do on the ES and G side of it so

16:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Oh, there you can also have two systems, you know, side by side one focusing, but it does yet like employees might be I need to go into the system and I need to go into the system.

16:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't I think we've seen it doesn't matter too much as long as the usability is good for employees that they kind of have a good feeling around it and not get like bothered by the login.  But I think it is fine also to have another conversation, you know, before we launch this with your one trust team to see like, you know, can we move it?

16:29 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But I'm a little bit hesitant, like I think because security and privacy is we have our own security and privacy system through a one trust competitor to and they're so specific around like data security around the cloud.

16:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it's like a very specific control set that's probably set up for that, which is different than the environmental one, but one trust probably has an environmental model and a social module and a governance model.

16:55 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I'm pretty sure that they do my guess is just that it's going to be costly if you end up using all the cross.  That's kind of a decision also you guys can make because you guys have already invested in one trust, right?  So it might make more sense or it makes sense.

17:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, start over.

17:07 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But we are not focusing on security and privacy.

17:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  that's that's kind of a choice because I know there's a lot of actually one trust alternatives like that or Sprinto that are even cheaper than one trust.

17:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've just focused greatly on that.

17:20 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  So, yeah, like, so it's more of, I guess, yeah, like a strategic discussion in terms of like Austin impact on organization and yeah, that that you need to think about.

17:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How best to do it, but we can we can get you set up for the E.

17:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's kind of part of our process is like to have you set up on the controls and and all of that very quickly.  so, yeah, so, yeah, so we're pretty kind of flexible and then we could also just test it and see, you know, what you think after like trying it out, you know, and it's like for you to play around the system and say, it doesn't make sense.

18:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  you know or how does this differ from one trust or we can like kind of wait a month and then have a regroup in a month and then have a kind of a discussion on how to how to do it or if you had more time.  So it's really it's really up to you guys like what would you like to see because we're trying to cover all of CSRD within ours like ESNG within CSRD because there's a G section there's an S section there's an E section but most likely I would say that based based on like that your E impact isn't going to be like if it goes through a double materiality your E impact is not necessarily going to be the highest because you guys are a digital company without heavy assets like it could be that your G your G is actually like your anti bribery encryption could be actually more of a material impact than it is for that but that said I don't know what your data how much data cloud you see you guys are using and that would be part of our process in terms of like getting the numbers ready so you guys can see what your environmental  impact is at a high level. looking at scope one and two, like electricity.

19:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we will touch that, that will be like the outcome of this process.

19:12 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  We will know these answers at the end of the process.

19:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because that's part of our controls, right? So like within our tool, we go through all of these different areas, right?

19:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  policies, training, communication, what you are understanding.

19:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But the controls part is actually the action that you need to do on each of these to show that you're doing it on a like a continuous basis, right?  Like that you're able to manage your anti-bribery and corruption.

19:39 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  You're able to manage your environmental impact and any kind of social thing. And then, yeah, and then same with third parties.

19:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  the question is like, yeah. No, but I understand what you mean because I see this in larger companies, right?  You have like you have like security sending out one questionnaire to suppliers.

19:57 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  You see health and safety sending out one questionnaire to suppliers.

20:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You start to see this in large organizations a lot of silos, so if you guys are able to figure this out soon, I guess my only thing is like, yeah, one trust is very, they've been around for a long time.  I've used them in my previous companies, I'm not saying anything about it, but I would say they're more clunky, but they probably cover, they will cover security and privacy more than we, because we're not focusing on that.

20:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But there's probably for your size of companies, I would say like Vanta is probably more cost effective than one trust, and they really focus on security and privacy, but they do something similar to us, but we focus on ESG and they focus on it.  So unfortunately, there's not one unit that does it light and easy for all across. we're flexible, guess.

20:45 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Yeah, I think this is how you're relevant, just with that context, so, yeah, so let's move, sorry, was...

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a of a cold start into this media, but I wonder if we need that part of the CEO in the room, because he owns a part of it, so we have a more holistically approach on this versus only...

21:24 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I think it's relevant, I think we need it, so if we can just continue and maybe we need a follow-up next week, if that's possible.

21:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's fine.

21:37 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  I'm happy to go to you guys' office right now and I'll go pretty close by, so we can also do that.  And I'm also happy, because we are doing this in portions every two weeks, one option is we kind of align this first and then by the time we start, we've gone farther and you guys can test more at once.  You don't need to be on board.

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  in two weeks to start testing policies, training and communications.

22:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You guys could be onboarded in three weeks and then have controls with it too, right? So we can be kind of flexible.

22:08 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  It's just that we know that some customers are kind of eager to get on because they've been talking to them longer than we've been talking to you and they're kind of just wanting to go in and they don't have an existing system.  So they just want to go in and deploy and test it. So I think it's more, you know, given the situation now we can set up another meeting next week, happy to share it.  And then we can have a follow-up meeting on next steps or we can just kind of start and like start like what we're doing with some companies is like as we're launching this is we're getting all of like what policies you have on E already and then which ones can we create for you so that you already have them ready and we can deploy them within our tool and then you have that to test out.  So that's also a possibility if you're gonna just get moving on some of this.

22:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that's a good option to see what we have and see what we're missing and then produce the policies.

23:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  And that could be a good way to start it, yeah. Yeah, so I think, yeah, we can look at that.  do you guys work on Slack or Teams?

23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Slack.

23:16 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Slack, OK.

23:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Then we've been creating some Slack channels for our pilot customers so that you guys can drop policies that you already have, so then we can see what you're missing on the site.

23:29 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  And then we can also develop some so that we can put into the tool and then you can look at it and test it.

23:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we can create a Slack as part of this process. Yeah, so then we can start communicating on that there.

23:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, do you want to just? I don't know how far we should go with this meeting. I would like to start up with.

24:00 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  hitting next week with our CEO who has really been responsible for this, that's how we are aligned. I'm not starting a new survey or pushing out things directly, if he is also the right person to do like, he has to overview what we have in place today and what we're missing.

24:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that will give us a better starting point.

24:26 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Yeah, we can wait then.

24:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We can wait until next week and have a meeting and see. Yeah, and it would be good to have a check at which aspects of one trust you have, so we can have a discussion on that.

24:45 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  But on Wednesday, I'm pretty free on Wednesday and Thursday before 2 p.m.

25:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wednesday is usually a good day for me. The fifth one? Yeah, the fifth. And what time did you...

25:25 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Any time before 2 p.m. for me.

25:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, should we at 10?

25:34 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  Yeah, at 10. Do you want me to come to your offices or we could do a team that doesn't matter, whichever is easier to explain?  Yeah, we can move now via Gränsen-ni.

25:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, Gränsen-ni.

25:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's close to Egatoria.

25:56 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  It's very close to Stortingen.

25:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, that's...

26:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But we're moved to the SCB scale center in Alcabriga.

26:03 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  So it's we're in downtown.

26:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So that should be fine.

26:06 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  We can meet in person at 10. Do you want to send the invite then so they can book the door?

26:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It could be good also, just like if possible before the meeting, if you could ask your COO to maybe reach out to one trust and see, like, when do they have an environmental unit, which I'm guessing that like they probably have an environmental module along with a social module and a governance model, the anti-bribery and corruption model, not the security and privacy.

26:36 - Oslo-5-501 Risk
  If you ask them about that, that could be good before the meeting on Wednesday, because then we know kind of a comparison of what they do, how much they cost and kind of your expectations, because that will also help in terms of that aspect of it.
