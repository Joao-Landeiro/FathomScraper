0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  good. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So Matt told me that I should meet you. Maybe he told you the same thing.  I took a look at the work that he did and I was intrigued. Why do you think Matt told us we should meet?

0:23 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  I really don't know. I just know that I trust him and plus at least if you said to me, then I'm up for meeting.  I took a look at what you sent which was really well done. So the only thing I could think of is that maybe he was prompting me to speak with you about maybe looking at our sales cycle and our funnel to see if  there is something that we could make more clear.

1:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Interesting, I don't really see myself as a sales or funnel guy, so I'm wondering, so let's try to reverse engineer, maybe it doesn't make sense but we'll just get to meet each other and that's fine.  Do you remember when Matt came up with that suggestion, what you were telling him, like it was about the sale cycle, what specifically were you telling him?

1:31 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  No, I'm done with my work with Matt, so we had already gone through it, I mean he just gave me a note saying, you know, I think that the two of you should meet.  Maybe I can clarify a little bit, what I took away from what you sent was that you're really good at characterization, is that right?

1:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Of a certain kind, yes, so if it were like a video course, I'm not an expert at and good at work,  So, especially remote workshops, but not only, but there's so many ways of productizing. I think it's best if I make it explicit to me.  Okay.

2:12 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So, again, where I got intrigued was so we are, we are very remote, you know, we live very remotely.  All of our work is virtual for the most part. We have a very high level, intense, know, our smallest engagement is a five-month engagement.  And, how do I say your name? Joel?

2:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a common question, it's a difficult one, it's Joel. Joel.

2:45 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah.

2:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joel.

2:47 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah.

2:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  was the best one, the second one was the best one. Joel.

2:51 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Okay. Okay. What I started thinking was when I talk about, you know, the sales funnel is, it might be easy.  for our clients to because of the work that we do is so different. It might be easier to create something like a workshop so that they could really get a sense of what the work is.  And I mean I can tell you a little bit about our current setup and maybe you'll hear where I'm coming from.  In other words it might be another product that Matt is suggesting that we create in between so you know it's almost like we've got the five month, ten month, fifteen month engagements.  Maybe we create a workshop that's that's an easier step in.

3:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it I sometimes call this Taster Workshops and I've also been experimenting with the idea of calling them like expertise demos.  It's just really...

4:01 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yes, yes, exactly. Exactly. And so what I currently have, know, and again, you know, Matt, I started working with Matt to sort of encapsulate and how do we message what we actually do.  And I love what he came up with. So the name of the product that we're really long, that we're really focusing on right now is called the StillPoint Experience and a decision-making platform.  So you basically are able to see how you make decisions subconsciously when you're out of your comfort zone. And so what that does is it gives us as leaders, it gives us the upper hand.  Basically when we come to a point that we haven't been at before, which can be often, and so I've got something that we call the Point Report, which is just...  You just go through the assessment and then you just get a one-page report saying okay, you know, this is how you currently make decisions This is what you know, if you made decisions from this viewpoint This is how things can change and then they get on a call with me and then they have to decide to move forward But then like I say It's a it's you know, okay Now we want you know, and now you step into a five-month commitment, which is a pretty big deal I'm wondering if instead There is you know, what you say an expertise demo or something like that where it's like, okay You really like the feel of it or you know, you've gone through a little bit more of it and Then that can help them make a decision About stepping forward into the bigger Engaged Perfect.

5:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So thank you for the context and I think I understand Quick question, why is it the minimum engagement five months?

6:09 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  A few reasons. One is that because it works on our, it rewires our brain. So I used to say that it's okay just to do what we call one sprint, one three weeks, because it takes three weeks to have an epiphany and then have those neurons wire together.  takes about six, no it takes about nine months for brain plasticity to kick in. It takes about six months for a new habit to form.  So when I was doing just one month and then three months, what would happen is people would do it and they would love it and then they  want us to go ahead and sign up for more, but when you're working with companies sometimes then there can be a big gap because then they have to go back, they've got to go get another budget, someone else has to sign off on it, so then we can lose a month or two and it's really hard on the teams because they get going and then they start.  Now I changed it to say let's talk about what we're talking about. What we're talking about here is you need to go from here to here, like right now I'm working with a company and they got acquired and then now they have to go to their next level, so they need their team to become high performing.  So they're in the framework now and it is happening and it's happening really quickly, but when we first did it the CEO signed up for a month and then this one team signed up for three months and some people joined in and whatever  And we did it and it was great. And then I said to them, I said, we're not gonna get there by doing this because there's no clear endpoint.  we need the clear endpoint and then we need to use all these prints in between to get us there.  So that's really why I did it was to sort of, prevent the stop start and really have people commit.  Like, what are we really talking about? I'm not that interested in people that just wanna do it to do it and wet their feet and then say that was cool and then it go nowhere.  But this is all really new. so like I say, and I think also part of it may be, I don't know, maybe not.  It may be the times. It may also be that I'm in the wrong waters. In other words, our first year,  may seem like a big financial stretch unless you're a big company. know what I mean? So I just may be working with companies that are too small, whatever, or it could just be our economic times as well.  So the reason I went to work with Matt was to really have this articulated as essential, not discretionary. Get out of the leadership arena and into the strategic arena.  This is all about strategy. Now there are a lot of strategic consultants out there, but there's not a lot of strategic consultants who also have a neuro-decision-making platform and can develop your people at the same time that you're developing your strategy, which is what we do.

9:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can really relate to that aspect of the time you need to go through the I got a course on coaching, not to be a coach, but I wanted to know about those tools.  And the course was like eight months and at some point I was like, this is taking so long and but it was very clear I was a different person at the end and everybody was a different person.  And that was really transformative experience for me and one of the best investments I've ever made. But I really understand what you mean like it's not about watching some videos or you need the time.

10:25 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, I get it.

10:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so thank you for the explanation makes a lot of sense to me and I think there's a couple of things here.  So one of them is you said that it might be easier to get a smaller commitment before moving into the larger one.  And this is based on the assumption that Difficult to get that commitment. mean what you have like specific examples.  You don't need to give me the details, but like specific examples where you thought I think I need a smaller thing.

11:10 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Like, what made you think about that? Um, let's see. A recent example was, um. Well, you know, a client recently, they, they really need to, uh.  Um, their focus is, uh, we need, we need better processes and systems. Um, we basically need our leadership to start to lead differently.  Um, and so I said, okay, great. know, we are definitely talking about a five month engagement there. Um. And then what they said was, and it was very interesting because they were about to spend a whole bunch of money on this other consultancy and then they said, okay, now we don't have to do that.  Then they went, they came back to, okay, well, we're not going to do that, but, you know, five months is a really big, huge number.  So can we just start with a month? So that's where, you know, and I can sort of stick it out, you know, and just say no, and keep saying no, but or I can listen to our clients and say, is there something else I can give them that is a smaller ask on their part.  And they get something, in other words, I have the assessment now, I'm interested, oh, I've done a workshop, it all makes sense to me, now I've built the trust up, and then it's easier for them to say yes, that's one thing.  The other thing that just popped into my head, and Matt didn't know about this, but, you know, here we are.  I'm working with an organization right now, and they're a nonprofit, they're a small nonprofit. but they are sort of our sweet spot client in the terms that these are impact companies.  And so not a huge amount of extra spend for them, but they really need it. And what I've been saying to them is why don't we co-opt this?  So instead of each individual company doing their own work, why don't we just create a cohort and then they can all pile in and they can all just pay their portion of the fee and we can do it that way.  And that's sort of hard for them to get their head wrapped around. I don't know why. just I loved what you said.  I loved how clearly it was articulated. I can even pull it up so I can tell you what really landed with me.

13:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

13:54 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  That's always very good. you Yeah, you seem to completely, I loved how you articulated our work, and that you set us apart in that way of like, you know, it's experiential, it's nature and technology, and it's sort of at, you know, this is like, you know, AI, it's not, it's based on human qualities.  And I think that's really important, because, like, even today, I was working with the CEO and he was like, Oh, gosh, I feel like I'm having a lobotomy.  Like, this is really hard, because he has to think that it's some strong worthy.

14:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

14:43 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  And I, and I kind of laughed. And I was like, Well, you don't have to do it. But if we are going to think differently, which I think this is a time that we really need to be thinking differently.  So I don't know, I just, you know, maybe you, you know, what would you like to create? For me like when you saw it did you have an idea that came up?

15:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the things and I'm at leaving now, so maybe this is not the best form for like First conversation, but it's just easier for me.  One of the things that Stuck out to me was when I think was experiential and it was You know very different.  I don't know how to say this, but there's like a texture to your brand like it doesn't feel To slick like it's it's really even like your context I know that this is not like a fake background like there's a there's a texture to this, right?  And I think texture texture is something that really benefits physical things, right? So one of the things I've Been wondering about  in this conversation. I've done this for myself and for other clients, but it's not something I usually advertise. So, but maybe there's something like a physical kit or something that you could send people.  There's a few things that I like about physical kit. The first one is it really stands out, right? It's not a PDF, it's not a video, it's like a thing, right?  And it has a smell and it has a touch and people put it on their desks and they think about you.  And physical things, you can also use them to help people follow through with the process, like put this on your nightstand, you know, and every day you do this thing.  And I think it's relatively easy to create something that really stands out and that is not from a product development perspective, really complex, right?  So, this was something that came up, I like it. Is it a deck of cards? Is it a diary?  it a box? I don't know. This came to me, but I would have to think a little bit more because the vanilla thing on my side, like my vanilla thing, would be to look at what you do and try to find points in the process.

17:25 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Right?

17:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, we can slice it here and put something special here. And we would try to find inflection points in the process and say, okay, this is a good first slice to take out of the five months and people get something out of it.  And it is also something we could do. But because of the fact that I think what you do is different, there's an opportunity here that I don't think all companies have.  I could organize these thoughts a little bit better, but these are things I'm looking at. right now. Does this make sense to you?

18:05 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Oh, I think I froze. Yeah.

18:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Good. So, yeah, my, my understanding is that from like a brother thing, the biggest challenge is just creating a stepping stone for a larger engagement, right?  This is like the business thing. There's, then there's some aspects of the context, right? The way, the kind of work you do, the kind of companies you serve, the way those companies make decisions, which is a little bit ironic because they are not yet making the decisions the way you know they could.  By the way, that must be a huge, um, I could imagine that being very demanding on you, knowing how well they could be making  decisions and seeing them like all anxious and anyway but so that's that's a challenge I see creating something something something like a stepping stone and I see these two basic uh or fundamental ways physical thing or maybe a digital experience like a workshopper or something like that yeah to to do this regardless of what we do I think we would have to talk about like you describing me or sending me stuff about your methods yeah because then I get I have a little bit more context to to see what things we could do and how to fit the parameters that you want like the cost to run it you know aspects like this yeah yep yeah I mean I I I definitely this so I've sort of built the company a little backwards so I built the product first many such cases and then and then I built

20:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  company and so where we are now is now we have to actually build like our our CRM so to your point it is it's not that it's it's frustrating or hard except well frustration sometimes because I if I could just get them to understand how amazing it is like it's I haven't ever experienced this before it's not a widget right and it's not something I can feel it's just when they go through it they go through it and they're like oh my gosh this amazing like I mean you can look at our website and look at all the testimonials you can look you know and so at first it's it's a bit jarring to them but on it they know it they feel it to your point you know the texture they feel that it's different they feel like it's genuine they may not completely understand it and then the results are incredibly transformative  And then for me, there's like no follow-up, right? So there's no real, there's, there's me as the start point.  And then there's no follow-up. And then how do we share those results out there so that, you know, people start to, you know, know us more and whatever.  And so I'm hearing what you say. It's like, look, privatization is not just a workshop, but, you know, maybe like I say, there's a unique or innovative way, know, to, like we're just about to do a scorecard.  Matt said, you know, go ahead and do the scorecard. So we're putting that, I'm pretty excited about that. So they can actually score themselves.  But, you know, where are we? And that will also help me see, you know, where they are and everything.  But I think it's just, I don't know, it's just like, it just feels like there's a gap between You know us and starting.  I don't know what I don't I don't know why I feel that way I mean the people that know us and want to do it they make a decision right away And they do it and then we do it and then it's great and Like I say, I'm just wondering if there's Something else that we can do You know, let's say maybe it is something that we could send them that it's right there What would have what would have them go I've got I've really got it, you know do this So, yeah, I'm happy to continue to chat with you and send you stuff and show you stuff and see what ideas come up for sure Yeah, yeah, this is a very interesting project One of the I was talking to a friend of mine it comes from the agency world And I was telling him about like the work

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ups and the way I was you know introducing the workshops because it's a very self-referential discussion I have like how do I sell the workshops right and one of the things he was it was saying that was that because they I like the way he phrased it because they can reduce that felt gap between I know you and I kind of trust you I'm not ready to sign a big check yes yes and and I think there's there's ways to to increase that trust it's actually is an equation right it's is it the size of the check or the the ways or the conditions of the check and then there's like the trust building trust for that right and there's ways to manage those those things I'm more on this on that side so yeah I'd love to know more I'd love to I can send you like an NDA or stuff like that yeah yeah I can yeah or I can send you one

24:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  That's fine. I'll send you an NDA. then, you know, like I say, it's sort of like, I think it's just because there's no box that this can go into.  And it just took it further outside any box by sort of flat rating it. So it's not even like a per person thing.  I guess, like I would be like a per engagement thing, which is more normal in strategy. But because you get the executive development in it, so people like, so what?  It's just up to six people. What if it's two people? I'm like, what if it is two people? You know, if those are your two people, and it happens to be the CEO and the COO, and you're, you know, this much impact in five months, you know, that's what you're hard about.  And if you want to add in more people, great. Like, again, this company that we're working with right now, they had to get started as soon as possible, but they're also hiring people.  And I'm like, well, that's okay, because you can just add the men whenever they're there. And they're delighted, right?  So that's different. The whole structure is different. then what we're talking about is different. It's metacognition. It's thinking about your thinking.  But it's also working against a specific challenge that you want to solve in three weeks. You just solve it by new thinking.  And so there's so much new to it that that and maybe this is just me that I feel like I have to explain it all instead of letting them just figure it out.  Like, I don't really know what you do, but I got it by your email. I like it. I can make a decision right now.  That's me.

25:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't need a lot.

25:41 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  You know what I mean? So I'm just like I say it's, is it, you know, once someone says yes to us and I don't know why the price point gets them, unless, like I say, they're thinking about it like  So, they're thinking about it like a $500 an hour thing and we don't sell it that way. I sell it for five months, right?  And we don't really go into the amount of time or anything like that because there's so much stuff that happens in between the calls and everything.  So, that might be an interesting point to really look at how we do it as upfront. And I just went through this one client and they're like, oh my gosh, no, we totally don't do that.  you know, for five months we wanted to spread it out and I was like, no, we don't do that.  And I don't do it because to me, again, it's about commitment. If you're gonna do it, we get paid, we do it, we're done.  And also in today's day, because things change, you know, this one company for sure, because they went through a massive cashflow crunch.  It's just too easy for them to say, oh, now we just have to hold off on that, and that's not serving them.  That doesn't serve them. They're gonna get through the cash flow crunch because I'm gonna help them get through the cash flow crunch for this new thinking and everything like that.  And so we're gonna get through that. So I guess what I'm up against is a lot of fear.

27:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Right?

27:24 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  And and people don't even know that they're afraid. But everyone's afraid. know, what if I make the wrong decision?  What if I commit to this and it doesn't work? if, know, I mean, what if and my answer is when I'm talking to them like this is, well, what if it does work?  Well, that would be fabulous. I'm like, well, let's just focus on that then because it's gonna work. I mean, how many testimonials do you need to see?  Why are you even talking to me? You know, I mean, so it's fine when I'm with them. But like I say, I'm just wondering if there's  Another way to shape the product, I don't know.

28:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a fascinating thing because there's so many levers that we can see, but we don't know if we can pull them without breaking the core of what it is, right?  For instance, the other day, I'm not an expert at that, but the other day I was reading more about, you know, build offers, right?  Workshop is a kind of thing, but then there's the offer around it. And I think the term got a little bit co-opted by marketing pros, but still there's like valuable information there.  And one thing that I had no idea was there's so many kinds of guarantees, like I only knew about money-back guarantee, right?  And which doesn't work for services like this. So I was like, okay, so there's a new lever that I didn't know that was there, right?  But... There's, so I have no relation to the guy, but you spoke in a way that maybe it's also makes sense.  no, just anyway, there's this guy, his name is Mike, Mike Greenberg, and he's going to run a positioning workshop that is framed around the risk in your business, like for people that don't feel the risk of the business.  And this will happen on the 19th, and it's a paid one. I know about this because he invited me to be like, like an extra set of eyes, just evaluating, giving tips about the workshop.  the way you spoke about this, maybe it would be useful for you. Like I get no commission. I don't want to make it look weird.  But, you know, when you said fear, that was really connected with the way frames this. So if you want, I can send you the.

30:00 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Semi-blank and again if you make workshops like that, you know, that's what I'm saying It's like so well, you know, what would our workshop be be about, you know, would it be about?  I want to say de-risking decision-making, you know So that's what I mean. There's I felt it when you know when Matt sent me the note I'm like there's something here.  There's something here, so we just have to discover what that is and and if people need that type of, you know, workshop or something Like that, no, I don't know how to make a workshop, you know, so Yeah, and I'm fine with trying to figure this out with you and if you realize that's not a workshop

31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a workshop. I'm really bad at lying and that kind of thing, so it's just easier. So great. Okay. I'll send you an NDA.  Yeah.

31:12 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  And then what do you want to see, what would be helpful for you to see?

31:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You probably have a lot of things, right? So basically the process and try to see like the main teasiness of the process, right?  And I think that would be useful. Also, if you have information about what people tend to appreciate the most, that's also very useful because we can try to shape the workshop around one of those emotional highlights.  Oh, people really like when you say this thing and all of them say this. Okay. Maybe this is a good place to put a workshop in.  So the process, I think I have an idea.

31:57 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Go ahead.

31:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

31:59 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So I smiled when you said it because What comes up a lot is people really like me, okay, which is kind of annoying because I really want them to like the former But I just had an idea what could be kind of cool might be I Don't know this may be a terrible idea, but it's almost like a workshop about being outside of your comfort zone So Even though We we think we know but you know like something to really go there to say, okay, so now this is out of your comfort zone Like feel it like this is a new Space to be in you're out of your comfort zone So how you're acting here is exactly what we're talking about Could be kind of cool.  So What I'll do is I'm gonna send you an NDA. I'm also gonna set you up with the point report, which is like our very first  start point at this point before the score card, just so you can go and I want you to go through it like a real person like don't do it as a test like really answer it right and then what we can do is I mean we can find another call time before we get off if we want then we can get on a call and I can explain it to you right and if you need to go through the whole thing you know I can take you through the whole thing it's a three-week process it's three minutes a day or we can pause at that point before we upgrade you and talk about oh okay so now what do you want people to do okay I can completely see the gap like that's too huge of a jump you know that kind of stuff you know what else do people you know really like well they they either really like carry me information or like like to the point where it's like I knew that  no one's ever said that out loud but I knew that now it's out loud okay fine or people will argue with it like there's five thinking styles one of the thinking styles is receptivity all the people that get receptivity are like I don't I'm receptive what are you talking about so because it's all about our blind spots right this is about shifting our mental lens so that we can we can't see we only seen through the lens that we have habituated yeah I'm looking at you through my worldview lens right now I've got all my biases going all my assumptions I don't even know where you live but it's like okay you know young cool guy super intelligent super smart he gets it you know like this this is my worldview of you thank you that it's like that came yeah we build these things yeah yeah we're and so that's how we an  every single one of us do it so here you are a CEO for your company and you've earned a lot of success because otherwise you wouldn't be the CEO unless your father owns the company but you know that's the lens that we're looking through so all of a sudden the world is changing the ground is shifting beneath our feet and we can only look at it our way you know like our country right now is in such turmoil right and people are calling like what are you doing I'm like what do you mean what I'm doing I'm going to work I'm breathing the fresh air I'm lucky I have to share you know like what what what and I put aren't you scared like of what of insanity no I'm not gonna be scared of insanity like I'm not even gonna engage with it like you know that's not help anybody that's a very different perspective for most people yes but I grew up overseas  I spent my first 20 years of my life overseas. I know other countries. know a lot of people here don't.  And for some reason that has bearing, right? For sure. And so that's what I mean. We all have these different perspectives.  So I'll give you an example. Sorry, I'm kind of rambling now.

36:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I love this conversation. Go ahead, please.

36:23 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So this organization that I was telling you about that I want to partner with, I think, I think if we can figure out a less expensive way for them to do it, it could be really awesome.  And so here I did the point report. So there's 30 CEOs on the call. And everyone now had their new thinking style, right?  That's what we call it. And they each had to insert a challenge that they wanted to solve. And so we had some time and I said, you know, okay, does anyone have any questions?  And this one leader said, yeah, like my my balance point is what we call it because it balances out all the other thinking styles of your mental end shifts is vision And I don't know how to use it And I said, okay, well What's your challenge?  And they said, well, you know, we've got our organization and it interfaces with about 400,000 farmers and there's not a lot of trust Um, and I have to get 400,000 farmers to trust us And I'm like, okay, so vision is all about new reality So The new reality is what?  And she was like Farmers trusting us and I'm Yeah and you could literally see the epiphany and she went and she went oh my gosh I know exactly what to do.  Okay so right that's what I mean it's like yeah so those are the moments when you say you know when people are really love that you know that that all of a sudden because they're thinking through a new lens they're seeing through a new lens all of a sudden they haven't moved their feet but the world is different and then because they're looking through a new lens they can see things that they didn't see before so you can see right there what went on it was the technology piece it was the science-based piece but it was also a human saying well let's just let's just look at this let's just take a step I mean all I did was basically help her you know if that had been online I don't know that we've had the same impact because it was human to human say  Tell me about that, right? So How do we you know and again You know, maybe this is the start of a conversation.

39:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like well, this is what we have But maybe what we should really be talking about is how do we create something that I can put it out on LinkedIn and then 300 people show up and we take them through something Yeah The thing as you were explaining this Like this specific situation What what came to me was and Isn't draft of course was there's like an aspect of Giving people lens and you lens right or a new perspective and you Yeah, but you equip them with that right like you give them That was cool  or a microscope or a kaleidoscope. Give them something to see something different, right? And then you prompt them to look at the specific thing in a different way, right?  Because if you just give them a lens, people will look at the same things they used to look at with a new lens, but it's the same thing, right?  So you give them a lens and then you prompt them to look at something that they might not look before, right?

40:26 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Maybe like let's use a stereotype.

40:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're talking to a CFO, you give them a new lens and you ask them to consider, I don't know, this is a really bad example, but the power of fluffy couches, you know?  And so you have these things, the lens and the challenge or the lens and the prompt. But then all of this is affected by the experience of you giving them these things, right?  So if the experience is not really intense, it will feel just a little bit wool and just, okay, let's get it over with.  Oh, nice. But if there's another level of involvement, there's an opportunity there for the actually doing the thing and trusting you.  So what came to me was like lens was challenged divided by the quality of the experience, right? If the experience is bad, just doesn't sustain.  Anyway, this is how I'm thinking. Here's an interesting, it's not really a case study, but it could be an interesting reference.  I don't know if it's still open, but there used to be in Brazil a museum of the person, right?  And you could go there and it was online and also physical. And you could go there and just watch normal people all across Brazil.  Brazil is also very large like the US, many different ways of living, different styles, different appearances, and you could watch these people be interviewed.  Okay, another story came to me, which I think makes a lot of different things. It was, I think, a primary school teacher.  Maybe you've seen this. And she used AI to change pictures of those kids as adults in the professions that they chose.  You saw this? Yeah, no, I think I did.

43:18 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, yeah. And that was really like, I don't have kids, right?

43:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I'll have them eventually, but I don't have them now. And sometimes I wonder if I would like to have like a fictional picture of a future kid because I'm doing things for them, even though they're not here yet.  Yeah. But it's a really powerful thing, a picture of an impossible, of an invisible thing, right? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

43:41 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  We are living.

43:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I love it. Yeah. Yeah.

43:48 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Yeah, I think that's what I mean. I think there's something else in this, something to give them a sense and a feel of it.  Um, that I think could. become, that could be cool. So, you know, I love that idea. would have absolutely no idea how to do it, but I love that idea of, you know, when we've got case studies and we've got videos and we've got, you know, so it's like, well, how do we take that to the next level?  And maybe that's what you're saying. You know, let's really see yourself there or, you know, let's really see others there.  I don't know. don't know. So, yeah, send me the link to that guy's workshop. I'm happy to, you know, jump in and I'll send you or Andy and get you set up.  And then when should we hop back on another call?

44:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, great. I'll have to hop on a bit on another call. Send me the stuff and then by looking at the volume, I'll have a better understanding.  Okay, great. Okay. Do you like scheduling links?

45:04 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Calendly?

45:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That kind of thing. That's fine. Okay, so I'll have those and I can use those. Perfect. You're in Brazil?  I am from Portugal, I'm Portuguese, but I live in Brazil. I was in Portugal when I sent you the email then, visiting my family.  I've moved to Brazil 13 years ago. Where? At Curitiba, which is, I don't know if you know Brazil, but it's south of Sao Paulo, like 400 km south of Sao Paulo.

45:37 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  So I was in Portugal when I was a very young girl, loved it. I guess everybody else in the world loves it now.

45:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  seems like it's very famous now.

45:47 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  Now everybody's moving to Portugal, but I loved it, absolutely loved it. So beautiful, so beautiful. People were so lovely, the food was so fabulous.  And then Brazil, yeah, I mean I've been to Rio, you know, also when I was a young girl and then, you know, later on for some work stuff, was in, and then I was in Peru.  I know that's not in Brazil, but, know, so you're, you know, that country is also very beautiful, I think.

46:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've never been to Peru. It's on the list. Yeah, yeah.

46:32 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  It's pretty, went to Machu Picchu. You went there? Yeah, yeah. That's, that's the reason why it's the funniest story.

46:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my wife, she's from Japanese descent and her grandfather, so goes the story in the family, came from Japan to Brazil to see Machu Picchu, but there was no Google word back then, right?  He did his research, but he was not aware, like, how far it was. So it came, surely this was not the only reason, but it was like a big deal, and then he realized, oh my God, this is like really far away, and I need to make a little life here, and then he made a life, got married, got kids, and eventually his kids, like my father-in-law, when they graduated, they took him to Machu Picchu, right?  So Machu Picchu has this very strong place in my wife's family. It's pretty, it's pretty incredible.

47:30 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
  It's pretty, again, I was there when I was pretty young, so there weren't a lot of people there, and yeah, and we didn't do it, but you could actually camp, you could hike up, and then camp at the different sites to get to Machu Picchu.  I thought that might be amazing, but yeah, mean, I was just fascinated, like how did they get these big, huge rocks with no cement?  and no nothing no machinery no and it's perfect it's like precision you know it's and then it's like then where did everybody go and I think they only found skeletons of men women and old old people very interesting so they were like well did the men go away to war and they all died or it's just fascinating but there's if you do go there's a pretty interesting bit of history that a lot of people know about so in in Lima if you go to the prison it's quite ornate you know we made building the original prison and if you go to Mexico City there's a palace the palace in Mexico City  which is not very ornate. And apparently the story is that the architectural plans went out from Spain, and I don't know what happened.  There's a lot of geographies to cross to get to those places. Well apparently the plans for the prison went to City.  So they opened it up and were like, well this is the plans for the palace. It looks a little drab, that's what happened.  then the plans for the palace ended up in Lima for the prison. So I don't know, it always made me laugh.  went to Mexico City many years after I went to the and I immediately had to go to the palace, but not for the same reason that everybody else wanted to go to the palace.  I was like, yeah, wow, it looks kind of square. Anyway, it's a delight to meet you. I say if you I think I think there really could be something here if you It's also your energy, you know what I mean I think not only is it your perspective and your innovation, but it's your energy and so I'm quite Keen to have you put your hands and your your heart on this and see what comes up for you I'd love to I it's very sincere I am flattered by it by that.

50:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

50:32 - Lisa Arie (Vista Caballo)
