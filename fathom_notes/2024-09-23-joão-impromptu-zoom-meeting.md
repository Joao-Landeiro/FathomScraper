0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a few times as well and I put it into practice I like there was this this opportunity somebody referred to somebody to me and I was like you know what I'm going to start getting into the reps putting the reps in and so far we have 100% hit rate I mean right with one guy and got a sale so really really happy yes my work is done now you just got to figure it out oh my gosh so tell me about it how did that go like what what we this is what I want to know first what did you ask and then pause everything I wrote down like so I had my notes from our conversation and then I cleaned them up made them like process and then I for the specific person I've prepared like a version of that for them and I literally wrote like Russian pause and then I  I wrote this all the time, everywhere. so that worked really well. There were moments where I could feel myself trying to feel in the space, right?  And I remember your words, I was like, I'm going to experiment with this pause thing. I think I've used, I'm not fully sure, but I think I've used the paper.  Like, oh, this is what he's told me, so the pause in the paper. And yeah, I mean, I think the best thing about it was, for me, was that it felt really honest, like the thing that we were talking about.  doesn't feel, you know, manipulative. And this person was somebody that was, I was, so English question. I was referred to them, or they were referred to me.  I would say this. They came to me. They called me and said, somebody told me about usual.

2:02 - Nate Jebb
  this is so convoluted somebody referred me to them okay so okay you are referred to them yeah do you know that are you familiar with like object indirect object you know all those things no I just let's not go into it but it keeps like borrow and land right it takes it goes the other way around okay so they were referred to me yes is that I say they were referred to me now I was referred to them you refer to them because it was get it down it actually does matter here's why that person was sitting down with your friend and your friend said I know who can help you I'd like to refer them to you okay because you know if you're referencing a book you're you're referring the book to that person if you're referencing a consultant you're referring  the consultant to that person. So you're the one getting moved around. They're receiving it. You're referring to them.

3:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, keep going. So, so for me, there was like an extra aspect of keeping this very, you know, I don't know, proper.  didn't want to come across as in a manipulative in any way. And also because the person that referred me, they know that, you still learning about this packaging stuff aspect.  So there was no point in me coming across, I was trying to come across as like, been there than that.

3:35 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

3:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I went through the first conversation. How was it? So the first conversation, we follow the persuasive question I ask him, right?  And then I did that, like, I think I have a way of addressing this. Would you be interested? And if I was very emphatic, which was great, because I guess I would be very interested, very encouraging for me.  Yeah. Yeah. um, and then I, I, I, I, exactly what I told me like a week from now at this time, can we do it?  And we got it, got it, got it done. And then we got the, I put something together. And I put something together, but not really a document.

4:23 - Nate Jebb
  had the documents from myself, but I didn't have a document to send it, right?

4:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's good. And, uh, we spoke about it. I, I've, I've stated like, I went through the whole thing, I said it in my price.  And then like, I was about to say, we can, you know, do it in installments. I didn't say anything.  I was just a hold it. And then he asked for the installments and I was like, yeah, we can do that.  So, and then I told him, here's what's going to happen. And I'll send you a document. I had a document like  Yeah.

6:00 - Nate Jebb
  I mean, because you're in this thing that I've been in for so much of my life, and then a lot of ways I'm still in, you know, where you're super smart, you know, your experience of learning and interacting with things is that you're smart, like you can figure it out, you know what to do, you make things that are cool, everyone has always told you that, I'm assuming like, wow, you've got something going on.  But like, when it comes to that moment of commerce, it like doesn't work for some reason. I don't get it.  I'm awesome, you know, what's going on? And I think you've got it now. Like, you've got it from here on out.

6:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It feels that way. Yeah, it feels that way. I mean, I can see a lot of, you know, kinks to iron out and everything, but it really feels that way.

6:49 - Nate Jebb
  So what if we did this? I know I know I've sketched out like what we were going to do, and we can do that.  But what if we just said, what is our plan? from here until you're at full capacity, know, like our job right now, you and I, our job is to get you completely booked, like you have as many clients as you can handle.  And so we just need to make an actual plan of like the activities you're going to take to get there.  Do you want to do that or do you want to kind of go back to the email I sent you and follow the more templated thing that I sent.

7:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me open that email.

7:32 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah. We share your screen with me because I did not review it before this call and I'm I'm not, I couldn't speak to it right off the bat.

7:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no problem. Just to find.

7:48 - Nate Jebb
  Or you know what I'll pull it up to.

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You don't need to share your email. I found it here.

7:52 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I have it in front of me. Share it.
  ACTION ITEM: Create finite list of contacts. Call/text for 15min advice call. Ask re retiring execs, industries. Request intros. Book calls w/ intros. Ask to be bi-annual counselors. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EhPri2EDm5r8etib91mgpCNNVhZQZvdG?timestamp=477.9999
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EhPri2EDm5r8etib91mgpCNNVhZQZvdG?timestamp=480.137797

7:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Share screen. One together. Yeah. Oh, sure, man, I am so pleased with this.

8:03 - Nate Jebb
  All right. So we were going to make the first session, like half of way down, we were going to make a finite workable list of people you know who would take your call today and make a fishing line, which the idea was you'd say, Hey, will you listen to me present the problem I solve?  And then that's your fishing line, you know, Mm-hmm, and I productize consultants now. And if you like it and it makes sense to you, will you refer me to someone if they come to your mind?  Like that was what we were going to say you would do. We didn't do that last time because I was like, I just need to give him like the big Like rundown on what I know.  Uh-huh. Should we do that for a session? Should we talk more about this opportunity you've got going and how to drive sales through that?

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I I think this opportunity might be too specific for now. So I think we can do like the finance workable list.

9:08 - Nate Jebb
  Okay.

9:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been reading about the fishing line. So I think I get it a little bit, but I want to get like your like the coordinate definition of it.

9:20 - Nate Jebb
  I guess I would just want to know in 10 words or less clearly what you do. So if I said to you, like I couldn't be more of a fan of you and that's true.  I will send people to you if I know them. What do you do?

9:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's really difficult for me.

9:42 - Nate Jebb
  And that's okay.

9:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's really difficult for everyone. So I'll talk to you about because I have no structure for this. I'll talk to you about this.  So One of the things I've been thinking about was just describing kind of what I do and how it applies directly to what they do.  Example, I help, know, consultants productize. And then I was thinking that maybe this is me just over-complicating things, but then I was thinking just, oh, why do they want to productize?  Oh, maybe they want more structure and their engagements, or they want to be able to explain their complex expertise to other people, like the pain point, right?  I mean, this has been kind of my dilemma. So part of me is like, I help consultants productize. And the other one is like, oh, I should just say, I help you sell more of your complex expertise.  And then, you know, yeah, I'll just pause now.

10:57 - Nate Jebb
  My only thought is this, one level. more detail makes it feel more compelling. For example, I heard a guy say, let's say you wanted to start a carbon mechanic business out of your garage.  You could say to all of your friends, I repair cars. Okay, that's your fishing line. Or you could say, I only repair jaguars.  It's obviously way, way more compelling that you only repair jaguars.

11:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also, if I know someone with a jaguar, I'll send them to you.

11:33 - Nate Jebb
  Or I don't know if you know that type of car, but like, yeah.

11:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so based, sorry, did I interrupt you?

11:41 - Nate Jebb
  I don't know. No, no, no. So based off of that, what I would want to hear is something like this.  I help design thinking consultants productize their knowledge. I help

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Lean six sigma consultants, productizer, not something like that, but keep going. Okay. Okay. Cool. So this relates, this, because I guess that I can change the fishing line, right?  Yeah. So this client, this new client, they are in this situation, which I've found a lot of people to be in because I'm part of a community that has lot of this profile, which is like a bit of an older guy that, you know, had like kind of leadership positions.  They're really clever. They're used to having good salary and so on. And then they left a corporate world and they want to shift into becoming like independent consultants, right?  Yeah. But the thing is, they have no idea on what to sell. And what I sold this guy is like my first consulting product.  That's like the name of the package, my first consulting product. And I'm guessing there's something there like I help, you know, get their first consulting products.

13:00 - Nate Jebb
  Okay. So I'm going to throw out a couple of examples. love what you just said, but I'm going to make up these examples.

13:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

13:09 - Nate Jebb
  Okay. help logistics executives make become consultants. How do you do that? Well, I help them define what they do from their life in corporate and I make it into a product that they can sell and teach.  Oh, okay. I think the key word there was logistics, or you could say, I help consumer package goods, marketing executives become independent consultants.  That feels really clear to me. Then people are going to say to you, how do you do that? And you're going to say, I help them define what they know, and then turn it into an e course or whatever you want to say.

13:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm.

14:00 - Nate Jebb
  So what Well, like, you don't even have to have one that you focus in on right now. But if you had to pick one type of corporate executive, what would you pick?

14:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To me, it's like my immediate opportunities are less about the area of knowledge and more about the phase in their life.

14:19 - Nate Jebb
  And I think that makes complete sense. Is there a reason why though you wouldn't want to just arbitrarily pick a type of knowledge just so it feels cleaner and clearer to people?

14:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think that's better. I agree with you. think that's better. Yeah, I think that's better. My struggle. Go ahead.

14:46 - Nate Jebb
  I know that there are a number of sales executives who I know who are retiring from, like, Procter and and, like,  like really good companies and Well, I guess I'm just about to reiterate the exact point I've just made. I would feel so much safer if you had a focus and you're saying, yeah, you agree with that, but it would just be a matter of picking the focus.

15:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct. Yes, I agree with that. I think my so, yeah, I agree with that. Absolutely. now my dilemma is currently in the context I am right now, there seems to be a pool of opportunity around this thing that I said that is more related to age or moment of phase of their lives.  Yep. And but I agree that if I find, I don't know, some industry or some some role or a combo of this, then like there's my  more nuance and granularity, just me speaking the lingo, the examples I have and stuff like that, I think it's really powerful, right?  I don't have that right now and I would like to avoid the innovation people.

16:14 - Nate Jebb
  I would like to not work for innovation people. Yeah, sure. So here's a thought. Let's not come up with the random one.  Let's say this. Out of the people you could call today who would pick up your call today. What industries are they in or do they know people in?  Because let's not make something up. Let's think about like, and we could even do it this way. We could make the list of people who would take your call and we could call them and say, well, you give me feedback on this and help me think through it.  They'd say yes. And say, I know there are executives who are transitioning to being consultants. And I. I'm quick on my feet.  I could learn any kind of industry, but I need to focus. What? Industries do you know people in that are at that transition point?  What are we just ask them? And then we don't tell everyone the same fishing line, but you figure out a fishing line for each of the people.  Let's say one of your friends says, oh, I know a lot of sales executives are tiring. Okay, let's make a fishing line for them.  I want to do that for each of the people that you call. And then once you get three or four of these projects done, and you've got some good case studies, okay, then we can just focus on that type.  But for now, let's do it by what is actually available to you. Let's fish where the fish are.

17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, first sentence you said, cool.

17:50 - Nate Jebb
  So in that case, we would just make a finite workable list.

17:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we'd.

17:54 - Nate Jebb
  And then we cluster it, right?

17:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay, okay.

17:58 - Nate Jebb
  So do you know, like, can you pull up? you're in all type. you pull up your phone contacts? if you only have two people in there, and it's it's your wife, and it's your mom, that's fine, you know, don't feel embarrassed if for some reason that's the case.  We're just we're trying to figure this out as friends.

18:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, no problem. I have this thing up here.

18:21 - Nate Jebb
  Okay, would tease you, would she, can we just go down this? These are frequently contacted?

18:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yes.

18:29 - Nate Jebb
  Okay, so this is my wife.

18:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this guy. Yeah, sure would. This guy, but I have this like kind of non-compete thing, because most of her network is around corporate compliance, and she doesn't ask me to do this, but I don't want to serve other corporate compliance companies.  No, this guy, I don't know who he is, but I don't know why he's ordered like this. This comes from a coaching course I took, and there's quite a few like first time coaches or people becoming coaches.  There's something here. because they need like a coaching package sort of product aspect.

19:04 - Nate Jebb
  Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. This is what I want to do. I just want you to say, would pick up my call?  Yes or no?

19:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay.

19:13 - Nate Jebb
  So would they pick up your call?

19:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes or no? Tiago? No. Okay.

  So cool.

25:43 - Nate Jebb
  All right. Now, and I will draw for you on the front what I draw for everyone on my letters, which is just a mug, okay?

25:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You'll explain that later.

25:55 - Nate Jebb
  Well, it's because I always have this one mug called little brown on my desk. I know this is stupid but it actually matters what it is not stupid, can I send it to you in an email or you want to write it down now?

26:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's fine, email is fine, okay, so just see if it's see if if it's fine, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

27:03 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah. Thanks.

27:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

27:09 - Nate Jebb
  All right. Now let's work on what you're going to say to them. Okay.

27:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

27:22 - Nate Jebb
  I think you're going to say basically. I'm trying to get some feedback on what problems the market wants solved.  Would you give me 15 minutes of your time? Can we have a call? When you're done writing that down, let me know and I'll tell you another thing.  If you actually know these people pretty well. you'd probably text them first. Hey, I need your advice. Can we have a call?  don't be so formal to start.

28:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's weird. Yeah.

28:12 - Nate Jebb
  You know, I need your advice. Can we have a call when they say, yes, like, sure, what you want to talk about?  Then you just say, trying to pick which problems to solve. I'll tell you more on the call, but I just want to know like, what are problems people are solving.  And then I think what you'll do when you get on that call is I wouldn't jump.

28:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I know, you know, all this stuff, I'm just saying it. No, no, it's fine.

28:44 - Nate Jebb
  I wouldn't jump right in with business. Okay, great. We're on the call. Let's get down to it. I would say, like, because it's fun.  They're your friends, too. You know, so calm and say, Hey, thank you for helping me. It's a go to five minute things so before I even jump in and ask like what's going what's up.  How are you doing? What's new like I would do that because It changes the tone of what they're gonna say next even you know Be who you actually are it's fun to talk to them And then once once there's that like once you kind of sense that you've had a good talk be like do like a really sudden like All right now, let's get it, you know, just like a real signifier that like Okay, no, let's do my short little thing and then ask them and then I think you asked them this question you say I know I can help corporate executives Become consultants Do you know any retiring?  the executives who want to do that, and then they're going to share, and you would probably say, or no, no, no, this is a way better way to ask the question.  I would say, I think I can help them become consultants, and then I would say to them, if you know any retiring executives, what industries are they on?  Because the reason I put it that way is you don't want to focus on like making them feel like you're just asking for a lead.  You are trying to make it sound like, and this is true, what industry should I target? like, I know I can do it.  I'm not sure which industry to do it in. Do you know any retiring executives and what industries are they in?  That's all it is. And then at the end of them, then don't say anything else, let them talk and don't interrupt.  And then at the end of them, I'd mean, I'd go, and then at the end of them talking, say, if I can figure out a simple way to explain how I solve that, would you introduce me to your friend, and then you have to say this, right, I will not try to sell them anything, but I would like to test out my solution with the real market person.  So what you're saying then is, can I have another feedback call with your friend? And then I think what we do from there is, if each one of those people sends you one person, or, you know, won't be that, some will send you two and three and some won't send you any.  Now, you have like a group of people in your corner and the beginnings of a target market. And I think what I would do is say to those people, as I learn more about this, would you be willing to give me feedback like once and every six months or something?  They will do it. And so now you're starting to build up like this kind of informal network around who you're targeting, how you're helping them.  And then I think what we'll have to do next, you and I, is we'll have to figure out like there has to be something like an email newsletter or some way area where you're working on your own thinking about it.  It's not that we're trying to build a big newsletter and build a following that's not the point. There needs to be some way where you can stay entitled.  with the people that you'll be gathering for them to give you feedback on what you're doing because I think what ends up happening with this is you'll begin developing relationships and they will not pop tomorrow it will not happen but over time you'll get referrals like the one that you just got and you'll know exactly what to do with them but that we're trying to get you more like maybe you should talk to my friend referrals when I'm trying to get direct I cold called you and you're working with me I just don't think that works or at least it's never worked for me maybe there's some people it works for now so to summarize what I just said it's call your list I ask if they know executives who they'd introduce you to that's step one  Step two is book calls with those executives and really, really listen to them. At the end of those calls ask them to be your counselor or your mentor.  So like would you take a call from me once every six months? I want to learn from you. And then let's go from there.  mean that will be a really good start. What do you thought?

  This feels very doable. It also feels a little bit more... not risky, but I mean more out of my comfort zone, but that's the point, right?  there's a side of me which is like, oh, but maybe I had some people at the end of my...  At the end of my contact list, that would be more fitting.

35:06 - Nate Jebb
  Well, well, hold on. You are more than welcome to do that, but this is my only challenge to you.  Set a timer set a timer for an hour. And if you can't get a better list than the one we just made in an hour, sorry.

35:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You don't get it.

35:21 - Nate Jebb
  Okay. So so you're allowed to go ahead and rewrite it if you want, but don't spend more than an hour because we got it.

35:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You got to get going on it. Okay.

35:30 - Nate Jebb
  And then your other point was it feels little bit more kind of awkward in a way, right?

35:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can see myself doing this and being able to handle it, but it does feel a bit more out there, let's say, like more exposed, maybe.  Okay, we honest. Yeah. Yeah, I think I have the tools to deal with this. It doesn't feel absolutely like.  Yeah, it's just different from like me spending the whole day on LinkedIn. But it's probably better because of that's right.

36:02 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I think if you could get Into if you could get into a situation Where you were making 10 phone calls a day, I know that probably sounds enormous like a ton Most of them won't be answered 10 phone calls a day Where you're just like every one or two of them answered you.  Hey, what's going on in your world? like, oh my gosh, it's crazy. just moved to a new company, but I can't talk.  I'll talk to you later You would never need business again if you can get into a way where you could actually call 10 different people a day And they're not probably most of them won't even pick up But if you just talk to them and you're not pitching that anything You're just calling them like what's going on with you and then I'll say I can't talk right now Where they'll say let's talk again, but like in a month Because again remember when we talked about let's have a separate conversation Mm-hmm.  That's all we're looking for you need to be in touch with enough people that everyone now and then you're going to one of them is going to be like man it is good to hear from you shoot I actually do need what you do can you send me something like I have someone I send you that's all we're doing yeah that's a good thing to aim at it's very tangible it feels distant now but I could see that you know do this for couple of years and it's not so strange it's just natural and I do like keeping touch with people and sending them links and books and stuff so that's you're great at it well and then here's the other thing you know who else needs this me I need to do what I'm telling you to do because like I'm in a situation right now where  I'm getting a lot of leads, but they're not necessarily the right fit. So if you think about that, that's just like actually a crazy waste of time.  Yeah. So I need like, I'm busy. I'm incredibly busy. Oh, wow. Good for you, Nate. But I need to redirect where my busyness is going.  There's only one way to steer the ship. It's this kind of behavior. I don't care if it's a phone call or a lunch or whatever it is, but I have to choose to go in a different direction.  And I'm just hearing myself say this to you I'm like, man, I should be doing that. And you know what I think when I say that?  Oh, that sounds kind of out of my comfort zone. It really does have a deal, you know? So, and I do this all the time.  It's what I do. So, I think you have a workable list. have the option to spend an hour doing homework instead, if you want to.  On a new West. I will send you this piece of paper. The names don't matter It's just so you feel like yes.  There's a person in the world who's there fighting for me and At our next session we'll check in at where we're at what you found, you know, let's try If we can let's book it for can we do it a few weeks out?

39:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm really in a yucky Absolutely absolutely Absolutely I'm very open just to let me know what would be good for you and Yeah, I don't want to be a complete jerk, but could we do like the 14th of October.  Is that crazy? No, it's good.

39:40 - Nate Jebb
  It's good Okay, so let's plan on that same time And then That'll be it I mean and I the last thing I'd encourage you is because I know you can do this  All of this is what is a kind of learning Don't don't think about it as homework Because I think about it as homework, you know, like oh, it's something you got to go do imagine Imagine you were at the beach, okay, and you found like one of those little pools with all of the Starfish and stuff in it, you know what I What is what is this one and you kind of poke it with the stick you just want to know what it's all about That's all we're doing Don't think of this as growing your business like treat it like an experiment.  You're like man Tiago I haven't talked to them in a long time if I call them What are they gonna feel are they gonna be happy to hear from me?  Oh, what if they're mad? Why am I so susceptible to people being mad at You Can I handle too much business like treat it with that same kind of like you're poking a starfish like what is this?  Because everything's doable if you have that those glasses on everything Even the worst work. I mean I told you when I worked in that factory.

41:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

41:17 - Nate Jebb
  I pretended I was getting an MBA And that I was studying the factory from the inside out and I wore the suit every day I would I would go there.  I'd bring a suit. I'd take a shower at the office I put the suit on and I interview all of the executives and the finance department stuff.  How cool that was just a perspective You know, I was just about yeah, but all right.

41:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, man No, no, I really believe that we have like a saying here at home everything is a game We would say it in English because it's just shorter and I think it connects perfectly with what you just said This sense of wonder it's very useful and makes it safe.

41:56 - Nate Jebb
  guess Yeah, all right.

41:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love talking to you. See you wait a minute. Bye
