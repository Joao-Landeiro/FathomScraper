0:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Thank you.

0:31 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Hello. Hello.

0:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't know if I'll be joining maybe I see that you moved the meeting now. Is it because of where or your schedule?  You cannot hear you. I don't think so.

0:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh. She asked to move and I just accepted their suggestion. Two, two, two, two So currently it's You So right now it's 8 a.m.

2:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  and I think she sent me a message in maybe half an hour or something, but...

2:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know, let start without her.

2:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe we can go through some things where we need her.

2:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, Romeo, do you have time to do something about integrity?

3:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  And then we can decide, I think it would a good idea to pass it Ebru, who is a bit...  It was exactly what we talked about and also a more visual right?

3:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, Romeo is... we're going to share two proposals on Integrity Hub.

3:31 - Romeu Rodrigues
  On the left, on made a proposal for my own page, where we could have a kind of test there, even with the big numbers, under the statuses, how to do it on bench, on right, I made a navigation, how to do it on the bench, like, there's LED, and it click, it enter the whole thing.  It's a little bit late. But it's form of structure.

3:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah, so there's two proposals here. One is more of a one-pager. The other one is more navigation thing.  I think we will need to figure this out because probably people don't have this. But yeah, basically some big numbers, more visual, an explanation, overview that can lead to more detail.  do you feel about this?

4:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Well, to me. One happens when you click more details on the cards. we open another page?

4:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For my understanding, let me check. So, Humel, what happens if I click here?

4:40 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Well, I didn't make a path, but we can show it down here. For example, if we turn it here, bottom I would it as it is in the last page.

4:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so yeah, it would take us to this thing, but maybe we could just append this thing, glue this thing to the end of this so it was just a navigation within the same page because I think then people can just export it as a PDF and do whatever they want with it, right?  For the sense of putting a view of the detail inside the tripod?

5:22 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Yes, here in the case I would have to just leave a card for the line to facilitate the expansion.  Oh, I understand, I didn't understand, it's okay, do it. All cards, you know?

5:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So like a previous management, a training, operation all here, followed after the other. Okay, so what's on your side, Ivan, what's holding you back from our side that we can unlock?

6:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  for you nothing nothing yet uh nothing right now actually uh so yeah just a little question regarding this integrity hub but but i think that we need other for this here so i don't think there's point in discussion discussing this here right now so uh yeah maybe you can share with share it in select with her and she can reply i think she said that she's in the meeting back to back meetings probably in the next two to three hours so maybe you can just send a message to her and in slack and then she can review it but because i don't i remember this because we don't want to show numbers uh in the integrity hub because uh it will be too personal or something like that but i might be wrong there i might be wrong there that's why i think it's important for her feedback so yeah but but all other than that it looks good to me got it okay uh

7:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  pass this thing here for each of them, you know that abstraction does work, right? So we had to put it in the little tripe and then we recorded a video to show what it be.

7:12 - Romeu Rodrigues
  One more question, here in this first series, I clicked, there you can't see more, And then it would open and it would be in that way, or all of them would in that way.

7:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I heard all the words, but I didn't understand the question.

7:26 - Romeu Rodrigues
  For example, when I'm here in the risk management, I click on the Tremor, it opens and it only opens this way, right?  Or not? What do you have to say in the beginning? No, it to end.

7:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like an internal source.

7:44 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It does a navigation down and then it shows all the openings, is that Exactly. Oh, I got it, perfect.  Okay.

7:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, that's it. Here the last one. Go ahead, Ivan, please. One more thing.

8:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I don't think you will show the things that are not implemented, so you can feel free to remove this access from the, I mean, it's not that important in design, but just so that we're all on the same page.  I don't think we'll actually show anything that's not fully implemented in this page because it's more like bragging page rather than status page.  That's how I understood it. So it probably will be all the greens there. I'm not sure what's the yellow one, probably some kind of in progress or something, but maybe that one might be useful, like we are working on this, I base asking for links, yeah, I think we, this is more like a bragging page rather than status page to be honest.  That's how I understood it, but let's see. That's what I think as well.

8:54 - Romeu Rodrigues
  That's interesting.

8:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's clear to me it's. Have you been joining this? Yes, yes, she asked my link. Oh, sorry, I found it now.

9:04 - A L
  There's something wrong with my email. OK. Hello. Guys. All right. OK. It's all No problem.

9:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We were checking the new version of Integrity Hub and making some adjustments, zoom out. So the idea is the new suggested version.  We have this space for a description. We have some indicators that we could use.

9:39 - A L
  And then we have this we need to change, this thing on the resources side.

9:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And just right now our discussion was, if this is a bragging page, should we just put the stuff that is done, nothing that is in progress?

9:53 - A L
  Yes.

9:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. Okay, and the navigation that we thought about is when we click here for three more, everything happens on a page, on a single page, so we would just scroll down like an internal link and scroll down to this thing which shows.

10:27 - A L
  Yeah, okay, so yeah. Unlike where instead of on the left, if you go to the first home page, if you go to where the ISO stuff is, I would replace that with about document request or like there's a section on like that you can request documentation from them.  I don't know if like if you look at the ones that I'm telling them. there they have something kind of similar on the on the Vanta one.  Yeah like question like questionnaires or miscellaneous some kind of documentation there.

11:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so the documents here would be what the policies? Yeah it would be policies pretty much and trade like policy documentation.

11:22 - A L
  Is it free to download or you have to ask? No I think it should just send an email I think it should just like for easy easy you can send an email to the contact the admin person.  We can have a mail-to link yeah. Yeah a mail-to link or like a and a submit link yeah. Got it.

11:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  So this is more like a request page so request for a document page rather than document repository.

11:48 - A L
  and then also a you know you used to have that button send like you had those three buttons like send for review or like what was it on the original one?  Oh yeah it's up there okay at this hotline share. Yeah, I miss that. I wonder if that should be, maybe that could be there instead.  yeah, or could it? Could you miss it there? I might be keep the top part more for bragging around Fortify.

12:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. OK. So regarding these numbers, what kind of numbers should we put here?

13:04 - A L
  I think it's fine to do that for now and we can figure out which one's the change and it's just like kind of an indication of what it could be.  I'm gonna have to change but I think this is a good picture to be able to show what it looks like.  Yeah, I was thinking like I think this is good but I don't know can we make it even more fun like I don't know like I think this is kind of a like I would almost like would like like two templates one that's like four like really fun and then this is like kind of the baseline one but I think at the maybe at this point in time we can also yeah move on to the other part if we don't have enough time for that I think this is good but as the game is more like a even more of a bragging page this is still feels a little corporate but yeah.

13:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you do happen to have

14:00 - A L
  I uh when you're thinking about more bragging do you have like a mental picture like examples you've seen around or something that's caught your eye even if it does not directly like you know you think about like comics right like you know they have like there's like a lot of color like pow wow you know we've done like these great like things like kind of fun uh that aspect you know um something a little bit creative like that makes us stand out from the crowd you know like you can create like you can do the fun boring one or you can be like you know uh a light one um but i think it's also yeah like timing and and stuff in terms of um how much time we have because i'd rather maybe spend more time on focusing on the updated policies part you know there um but yeah i'm gonna have another thing that i've been working on i want to show you guys too that i need help fixing up but um yeah okay um got it but so for this one  I think if he fixes those small those things that you have made I think then maybe we can just Stop it for now.  guess Because we might need to redo this anyway for VSME and then we can like because like VSME has different content Which I can show you And then yeah go from there But so this is not to be developed right now Not until we I would say I would say if we can Fix these changes I think that is good and we're probably not going to develop it now But this is very good for me to use for selling.  I kind of explaining what we do Um, but I think it's very good to have that. I don't think We're going to develop I think we need to wait a little bit, but let's let's see Um, let's see how the dashboards and everything look Yvonne.  What is that stuff done?

15:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  Uh tomorrow Tomorrow, yeah, we will create a release tomorrow morning so you can send emails. Yeah, we we got  on some bug that we have with controls, but we will create a release tomorrow morning and you can send the emails and then throughout the day, I hope we will release their results.  So that's a bit push for us, but yeah, we got delayed a bit on the controls, bugs and stuff.  Yeah.

16:19 - A L
  Yeah. Then it stops.

16:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, okay.

16:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on the design, the last time we checked the I don't wait, what do do with this?

16:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  What's next after controls and dashboard right now because I think our priority is changed. So what should we do?  Are we next?

16:43 - A L
  I think we should do the updated page for the policy part. Okay.

16:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then we need to work on that one after integrity from the design side. okay, let's update the yeah, let's update this list.  Okay.

16:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So controls is the in developing? Yeah, it's almost done.

17:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  controls are done basically. So you can mark it as almost done or whatever. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Same with that. There is in progress or dashboards.

17:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Third-party management is not as good. I think the design needed to be up.

17:25 - A L
  Like you updated that design, right? But it wasn't so different than what we had before. But I would just drop it right now because I've been reading a lot about VSME.  Like I think we need to rethink our platform. So I think the next thing would be to fix the onboarding on the policies, communications, and controls.  At least the feedback that will also affect VSME on how it's done. And then I think we need to kind of pause and wait while we figure things out.

17:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I think you can replace the three and four. So it's onboarding. So it's now priority after the airport.  Integrity Hub. I know you already did Integrity Hub, regarding the priorities, it's onboarding.

18:06 - A L
  And then I would say that we might need, especially like that, I think we need to, I think the next step will be also to do like a template or like a front-end on a new compliance map for BSME, which I can show you that next, because I like realistically, I think we need I just talked with Cognite today and I don't think they want to do 14,001 anymore, which I actually don't want them to do 14,001.  So I think we're aligned that we need to, but they want to do BSME, which is very good for us.  So they want to, I think they want to do BSME comprehensive, not just basic, which will be very good for us.  I'm feel I'm going to try to meet with all the customers next week, but I feel that we need to kind of pause on what we're building here because it doesn't not all of the parts like risk management doesn't align with BSME, third-party  Management doesn't totally align with the SME parts of it if we work with large companies it does but with small companies It doesn't so but the controls do align with the SME dashboards.  I think a line with the SME Onboarding does align with the SME we need to change it around a little bit So I think we need to kind of rethink We have to spend a couple time rethinking about this Yeah, got it.

19:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it So but do you have a proposal for the compliance map?

19:28 - A L
  I Don't have a proposal, but at least I was trying to gather what it could look like and I can I can share it with you Like I'm sure I present Yes, how long do you think it will need I don't think it'll take that long but it's yeah, do you have let me see No here So this is I took this from the compliance map that was here  right? And I tried to like look, this is the original compliance map. We haven't put that in yet. But this is, if you look at, there's two types of BSME, basic and comprehensive.  If you look at basic by itself, it's something like this. Like BSME like B1, which is basis for preparation, B2, practices and policies, which are called general disclosures.  So you kind of and governance metrics that you need to report on. Energy and greenhouse gas emissions, which actually we have some of this already in our controls.  We have not so much about pollution on air. We don't have biodiversity. don't have water. We don't have reuse on this.  And then workforce general, we don't have so much on these either, but they're not very hard to do. Like some of these will be more hard to do.  And then we have like governance. So that's I'll try. these controls, are these controls? They're not that much like, there's not that much like reporting, this is more, it's mainly reporting so we can use our tool to assign to people that they need to like fill this in in certain time periods.  And then, and then I did another one, which is comprehensive. Like the comprehensive general information is that you need to do basic here, but then you also need to do the comprehensive after you do the basic, which is like one strategy and business model to and then and then comprehensive metrics, which is as a G.  So ideally, it might be a toggle, it could be like, or like, I'm not sure how we want to design this and then I had put these here on the side, because I was thinking one, you know, one could say I didn't know how to do it.  Romeo could I do one could say like, you know, basic on the side and then the other one could say like, you know, comprehensive.  And then probably the color scheme needs to change to kind of match it. But these are the main content areas moving forward.  So we almost like these are going to be the points that matter that we need to kind of figure out how does  How does our tool either change to kind of match these points from the back end on the behind the side or that we need to create new areas for it?  So, yeah. So it would be great if like Romeo, I think first we should prioritize getting the policies procedures and trainings like kind of that new entrance page and like whatever because there is a section in VSME where you need to be able to show that you have policies for certain topics.  So it's kind of perfect that we can still use that policy side in our tool because then we can use our policy to deploy it and then you can say that you have it.  that thing still needs to be fixed. But then after that for Romeo to kind of recreate and rethink about this because this is also very helpful when I go to the customers or potential customers and say like, look, this is all you have to do for VSME both basic and comprehensive.  This is how we're going to kind of work the tool and then we need to think about how the controls fit behind each of them.

22:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, a question. Um, all of these boxes, they are filled in by the compliance officer of a small company or a large company.

23:08 - A L
  Um, it's, the SME is for like small, medium enterprises is what they call it. So from one, like from 10 to 500.  Got it.

23:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So either you see this compliance map or you see the other compliance map. You don't see both. Yeah, you don't see both.

23:26 - A L
  It's like, we most likely we will have to replace our compliance map with this. Got it.

23:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what's in behind the each of, what did we find in all of these boxes?

23:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't know.

23:37 - A L
  don't know yet. You're okay. It is, and I think I could like have it, it is laid out in VSME and the documents that I set you, like the standard, goes box one, this is how you calculate box one.  This is what you need to consider in box one, box two. This is what you need to say in box two.  So we kind of have to translate that into, into the, into the tool, but at least these are kind of the criteria.  that they expect you to report on for basic and comprehensive SMEs.

24:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then the idea that some compliance officer in a small to medium size company or someone who is in that role will come in, go through these boxes, fill in the data they need to and work on this and get the VSME certified, right?  That's just the summary, right?

24:22 - A L
  And they don't need to get VSME certified, but they need to fill in all of these boxes and all of these answers will ideally go into our integrity hub and then they can use that integrity hub to answer the questionnaires on people.  But I think there's kind of a mapping exercise that needs to be done. we can still like, I do think we are going to lose customers as part of this.  think Hydro Rain will be out. Anybody who has a compliance officer that kind of knows what they're doing, they will be out, like Acre Horizons, Acre Carbon Capture, Acre Horizon, like we're going to lose them.  But the companies that don't have Telanor, I'm discussing, well, no, Telanor will always keep because they're just kind of crazy, right?  sign the agreement with them to do that. also as part of this working with telling or saying, how are you going to request BSME for your supply chain?  Because now you're a big company, should be using BSME to connect information, how are you going to do that?  So that's part of the process that I'm with them. So there's going to be two levels, right? this idea is like, you're a person who doesn't know what to do and I kind of click through and this.  But there's another aspect of like a questionnaire or like maybe like this, like maybe telling or sends like a questionnaire and that's like, it's something where they can fill in.  I'm not sure there, but there's it's sort of come from two sides, right? But right now we're building for this.  But I think if we can get this cleaned up, it at least it's a good thing to show like our potential customers.  want to meet with them all next week and like try to get them to buy it and be like, okay, our compliance map has kind of changed these focus areas.  We do overlap with certain focus areas, but not with all of them. And so we're going to rebuild this with you as part of BSME because you're going to have to.  to do this anyway. So yeah, shall you look concerned or confused? It's my standard look.

26:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the three columns, the purple one, the orange one, the blue one, they, because this is red from top to bottom, they happen at the same time in parallel, right?

26:25 - A L
  Yeah, I think it's like, for me, it was just more of a visual of like E, S, and G, know, it doesn't need to be like up and down.  think if we, like at first I was trying to get it to like maybe like E, know, S and G, like this, you know, you could do it that way too, E, S, and G metrics, and then you have one on top.  There really is no order on this other than you probably do these two first, you know, these like the general information, and then you kind of go down and do, and then do the rest of them.  Does this change depending on the, on boarding?

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you mean on the onboarding? So on the onboarding, the thing we're going to do for the policies, if they choose different objectives, does it change which boxes are available?

27:12 - A L
  Yeah, I think where we would go is that they either choose basic or comprehensive. then so if they choose basic only, then they only see the one on the right.  If they do basic and comprehensive, then they need to do one. So like I feel like only Cognite really needs to do the comprehensive because they're at like 750, 800 people.  So they're close to CSRD. So they're kind of expected to do more. Whereas our other ones that are around 200 people, like getting around with basic is already going to be a little bit of a stretch because it is like pretty detailed some stuff, you know, they want to find water usage in a co-working space.  it's stuff that they're still going to have to do that will take some work to be able to get it.  But this is kind of the, at least these are like kind of visually you can be like, okay, these are what you need to do.  to do these boxes and then you have BSME there but of course behind these boxes there is some things that you need to do but it's not it's not a lot like I think the hardest part will be the e side the e um carbon emissions because they go a little bit farther than where we go and then they go into like nature based different things but then um that so I think it's like it doesn't need to look like this I think it's more like for these are kind of the two groups one is basic one is basic and comprehensive and I think that I think to be honest I think we need to kill the ISO 14001 like it was already hard enough like now nobody wanted to do it except for Cognite and now Cognite is saying BSME and this is so much easier than 14001 so that's also good for us but I don't think everything is lost like we have the compliance map that we could change we have the policies procedures and trainings that they can still use we have some controls that map over like scope one and two and luckily we haven't built the other parts that don't overlap as much so then it's like building the

29:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  other parts that that are new in there that we had a plan for so okay so right now the current okay i think we need to to stress this before jumping into the design because for instance this box engine greenhouse gas emissions yeah this is akin to the current cavern reporting right something like that yeah it's a little bit uh i need to look exactly what it is in it but it's it's close to it yeah well but this is on a level like if i click here i'm taking to that specific control right currently in our uh current model it's a little bit more broad right let me just um yeah i feel like how do i say and this is probably what we need to do like some time in

30:01 - A L
  in April is to kind of map this, but like, how do I say this here, for example, share my screen?  I think one is just to have a visual of like, these are the buttons you need to do, because I think that's also good for the user.  I need to enter B3 as part of the standard, so I go in. What the next step is, I think we might need to redesign and rethink, because if also look at the way that we have done, I want to present something else.  So this is VSME, like this is the VSME standard, I've been kind of going through in it. Like, so basic environmental metrics, energy and greenhouse gases, the undertakings though, disclose the total consumption megawatts hours with the breakdown at the table, if obtained, you know, as a breakdown.  So we do look at electricity in the way that we've set it up, right? And we look at renewable, but we don't have it in this table.  I have it in green, because like, this is what we have been. doing, right? And then, and then the scope one, went to go into a location based scope two.  So yeah, we are doing this, they want it in a certain part. But there's a lot that we aren't doing like biodiversity.  And it tells you like, how it really does walk you through what you need to do. You know, like it talks about water withdrawal, it has a different process.  So each of these, we need to go through like the red is where we don't have it. Yeah, I think he stopped sharing but I think, okay, let me try it again.  So in this, I have been mapping like green, we seem to have red, we don't have what we need to put in a place.  Each of the and then comprehensive they have some, know, they talk about specific practices were put in place policies for transitioning towards this.  You know, we have significant scope three categories, depending on we have some so scope three categories, but like a target reduction, you know, you need to have so all of these have things that we need  to go into and then behind that thing that they click there will be like some things that we need to figure out how it's going to look.  So I think it's going to look different than how we made it with the controls. It's not going to be like we set out a control it's more like you know when reporting make sure that you include some of these these things.  And the policies as well right? What do mean about the policies? Yes like they have like so does the undertaking have a code of conduct or human rights policy for its own workforce?  Does it cover? Yes right so we in our thing we can give them a code of conduct and with human rights policy that they can edit and deploy and then they can answer yes to all of this right.  But it's but I think that's a small subsection of everything else that needs to be in here so it's not necessarily going to go straight into a policies page it's like do you have a code of conduct or a policy if no here use our tool to to do this.  But I think that like... But in that case should we change the onboarding for policies if policies...

33:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  is if the policies page disappears? It's a good question.

33:08 - A L
  No, but we still will have the policy flow and the policy with all of the pages in there.

33:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yes, so the whole idea on the onboarding for the policies was that it was overwhelming to give the people so many options and they would have to choose, right?  Yes, as far as understand, just tells you what you need to do, right? Well, yeah, but it also says that you need to set up a policy, right?

33:32 - A L
  And our whole section is about setting up a policy. Like it says right here, you have to have a human.  No, I understand. understand.

33:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then they don't choose which policy. They just set up a policy, right? It's like a checklist. They cannot remove things from it.  they want to be a semi, they have to do those things on the SME, right?

33:53 - A L
  Uh, ish, like they say, you know, you should have a human rights policies and processes. So it doesn't say exactly.  which ones you have so it's like but it should cover these topic areas and like so it's like so I think we have to give them like here's an option for the human rights policy or you could update your own policy you know here's some environmental reduction policies but you could update your policy so it'll still be an entrance where you need to choose I think that entrance doesn't change I think it will just be a lot less policies than they they they need but do we still have a new filter on the beginning of that process so yesterday we discussed that we'll just have first step we'll be choosing ESRG or multiple and then changing the policies yeah I don't know I think it's gonna be you pick the these are the policies that you need to have like here either you report your own it will be still similar but it'll be a lot less policies if we get rid of ISO and the other ones it's like probably like six policies that they will need to select  But it is a good question. think this is also, you know, like, maybe we should just pause and not do development and like, like, maybe not, like, not, you know, I've, talked with even about this, you know, or like, sorry, not also, but this is also what I'm thinking.  Maybe we need to like pause development because it's not like our, our current customers are like dying about this, right?  Like, it could be that we pause after we get these cleaned up and whatever. We just pause development for a month while we figure this out, like what it should actually look like, you know, and dry it out and spend some time on that.  And then. Okay, but there's there's two kinds of visual visuals, right?

35:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's visuals for selling and there's visuals for development. I can understand that some visuals, even if they're not going to be developed, they help with the sales.  So we could update that perhaps not on a super granular level but just have a thing to show. show, right?  then we should try to see how each part connects to each other, Because this change is significant. If we are keeping the old compliance map and we are adding this compliance map, depending on what kind of views they will have, then we need some sort of onboarding for big company, small company, or set it up in the back stage.  But anyway, it needs to be existing. But for these things to coexist, and we don't need, and it's not needing to develop two completely different platforms, the compliance maps, they must have the same level of abstraction.  So right now, the initial compliance map was the level of abstraction was planned, due check, right? And inside of those, there was like a box that says policies.  If you open that box, there's multiple policies in different layers, right? That's a level of abstraction. If we use the compliance map as a bit more of a checklist, just follow through.

37:00 - A L
  on these boxes we are using a different level yeah and this and keeping these two things at the same time would mean eventually that we need to create different flows for controls for yeah no i i i don't think we like and this is where like i'm literally like you know i did this last time where i'm like going through again like fine tooth combing and and like trying to understand what this actually means you know because it's less like tomorrow is one one month the omnibus came out like so this super new that we're trying to figure out and bsme became like a lot more popular right so this is like we're in like the middle of the breaking news or three or four weeks and everyone trying to figure this out and so that's why also my advice is changing week by week as i learn start learning more i'm like okay wait this doesn't make sense okay wait talking to cognite they're saying this okay wait this and this is why like it seems like i keep changing my mind but it's also because this is literally three or four weeks old and everybody is trying to figure out what this means for the company and what this means for the changes and what this means for the industry but as i go through it  I realized that my initial assumption of ISO 14001 and my initial assumption of like, this is best practice, you know, you should do it this way, even though it is a lot simplified compared to what a lot of the consultancies are doing, it's still more complicated than the SME.  like the, you know, sending, like the whole getting like the SME, I think you might be able to do it without all employees involved.  Right, like, know, like, and in mind, like, yes, maybe the policy, you send it out and do that, but you don't need to have this conflict of interest register, it gives an entertainment register, all of that because that's best practice.  The BSME is not, BSME is not like, doesn't isn't focusing on that at all. Like, I can like pound my head and be like, hey, you know, hey, companies, you should do this because it's best practice.  Like, it doesn't matter. They're not going to want to do it. They just want to do BSME because that's what's being said.  And that's minimum. And I can get away with that. Right. I think that's my ego going through this three or four week process being like, my ego being like, you should all do best practice, even if it's the simplest way.  our customers, Like even trying to get all of them on ISO 14,001, which I thought was like a light easy process has been difficult, right?  Like that's also been feedback being like they just want to do the bare minimum on everything, right? And so now, like now we know what we know and we spend time building this platform even though we haven't spent that much time, it's been 30 months and we've learned a lot in that.  Is it time to also now, given BSME has come in, rethink what we can build, can we build a much lighter version given what we know what we know?  Can we use AI in this process to also make it easier given what we know what we know? But it's kind of like a pause reset that we need to figure out sooner rather than later what this means, right?  And I think this is where using April to figure this out is very important so that we don't end up.  And I think it's a good point. Like maybe we don't develop but I was just more thinking like, okay, even I'm running things to do, let's go develop it.  Maybe that's not the right methodology for us to do. Like then, yeah, we're just, yeah. So that's the So, that's kind of the thinking.

40:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think there's two things to do. One of them is to organize how we're to map this. And the other one is to maybe go back and check little adjustments that we didn't have time to do and have a list of those.  And perhaps if they're not too complicated, just iron out some kinks in the design. Especially on common areas, things that should be used regardless, right?  So are we going to have an employee portal with VSME, guess not, right?

40:39 - A L
  Well, I think the thing is, I'm trying to not have, my frustration is about, this is also, I'm trying to work through my ego, right?  I hate reporting softwares because you actually don't implement everything, right? VSME is kind of turning into a reporting software.  So are we going to turn into reporting software or is one of our value adds actually we are reporting software that helps you implement right so like a lot of reporting software's would be like hey upload your policy here you know and then and then it's like a glorified checklist that's where most software ones are can we take it one step as our could our selling point be one more step forward it's like we don't tell you just to upload it it's like we give you this things that you need we help you deploy it in your organization and track that follow-up so that you could do the SME like we are one step better than like just the reporting tool and that's a good sales and marketing like we help you walk through the process we use our tool to be able to assign it to people with an organization you know and they have their own portal where they can submit the information so that you have everything in one you know so maybe the employee portal is not going to everyone but it's going to everybody across the organization that needs to be involved in some of this whether it's HR you know finance it or whatever you can still use our tool as a workflow tool right so there is some you know training like yeah you're supposed to be training people as part of the SME okay here like here's all the the data that you need for the training whatever that matters  it's okay go in like so I think there is still parts of that implementation that we can put into the tool but it could be like I'm being stupid and I'm just trying to hold on to this implementation side and the whole industry is just going to software to to to reporting and they just want a checklist and I should just you know not be old and like a dinosaur and just get with the time that it's going to this this area right and this is kind of also what I'm trying to see.

42:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  okay okay so yeah we have I think it's clear the new priorities let me share my screen just so we but but is it is it really because from from this talk now I'm not sure if the number three is priority or number four is priority I got the number four is priority design wise and development wise we don't know what's the priority is that right yeah I think that's probably right like in terms of like

43:00 - A L
  I thought development wise policy, I'm like why don't we just fix it because I feel like it will need to be fixed.

43:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  we need to add upload of PDFs that's one thing we need to add for sure in either versions of in all versions that we mentioned there's always a PDF upload of your current policy so that's that's one thing for sure.

43:17 - A L
  Is there a way to like edit like edit within like edit the policy is there any AI thing that we can look at and at the same time is there any like a lot of people are like I want to I want to edit the training within the training itself or like or something like that I don't know.  Well the problem with PDFs you cannot edit PDFs that easily so that's really hard to do. Because it was a kind of a shorter faster thing to market is there a different solution for training?

43:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah I'm not sure what other than video and PDFs sound to me like the usual format for these things so I don't think we can use anything else rather than that but for example one thing that we don't  have these questions, questions. So that's something that you don't have. If you upload your own training, you need to be able to define.  Yeah, yeah, custom questions would be good for that too.

44:12 - A L
  and we will need that for sure. you have the magic link entrance, I'm just thinking or Google sign on Google sign on could be something to look at.  Yeah, I would put our parent unit, but sure, why not?

44:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Because we have magic links. So I would say that it solves the issue of logging in. But yeah, we can look into it.  But I would put it lower price given it's rather these other things we mentioned sound like much better UX.

44:38 - A L
  One of the things I would think about even it's like, or like, if the semi ends up taking off, it's going to mean a lot of like a lot of companies being onto their tool, right?  So how could that one like what would we need to make sure we would be able to like onboard a lot of companies?  And then the other question is like, also maybe like to take some time to think how could architecture, infrastructure, work for large companies who want to tap into vSME and ask questionnaires for vSME.  Do we need to have an API where they can like log into our database and they automatically see what the companies are in there?  Would they be part of our platform or would they try to access it from the outside?

45:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't know. This is where we need to think. Those are two different things, but we can have even public APIs and with some data, for example, with that trust center or the integrity hub, that's the thing that companies can tap into in theory visually and we can also make it work with API.  Although I doubt that companies will use that API to be honest. We need to think about how we can integrate, that's I think bringing them into our platform.  example, imagine telling them trying to solve their party management, they can immediately find their suppliers in our database and just we can calculate for them their carbon or footprint or whatever they need to calculate.

45:59 - A L
  How does that plug into their system how do you match their name with our name you know like the names in RSE so these are the things that like I'm not against like I was thinking of telling Talonore being like hey for your pick 100 of your suppliers that you want to test this with and we'll do it for free with them like you know and help the suppliers do that and get on board so I'm like but if that's the case you know what do we need to have in place to onboard like 100 Talonore suppliers to try out the SME right so well in theory in theory the onboarding on this shouldn't be manual at all it should be really automatic so that we don't I mean that's I you know all know that it's ideal case but we should start from that I think immediately it should start like when it comes to the platform they shouldn't be handheld by anyone yeah they should automatically know everything not automatically but they should be guided to the UI yeah so these I think maybe we have to spend some time in April thinking about these strategic things rather than coding but then we just need to think about yeah about that and how that works

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on our side, work on the design side, we work on the onboarding for policy strains in communications and controls.  Yes.

47:12 - A L
  I don't know now how you're saying that. Maybe it's better than- Custom questions, maybe, that's something that we can design.

47:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's for sure. That's for sure something that you'll need, custom questions. So we need a design for that. Where do you click to do a question?  How do you add a question? How do you see questions that maybe? think that's a suggestion. Apple policy, I don't think you design why there's much to do there.  It's just a button. We can have a button somewhere in the UI, and that's it. And then compliance map, guess.  That's when we design what I see. I don't know if you see something.

47:47 - A L
  Yeah, I think that is good for now. I think, yeah, maybe. Things are changing so much, but yes, I think, yeah, I do think like the onboarding, yeah, like maybe the onboarding to the platform, if, you know, we are targeting small, medium, but like, I think for, I think I like what Zhao said is like, you can create something very simple on the compliance map just to be able to show people, but then maybe have a deeper dive into what it actually means and what it looks like.  And then also, like, kind of a designing of what is a typical onboard for like a more product-led growth type of thing?  What does that look like? And is that something that can be, maybe that should be prioritized so that Yvonne and the team can work on that self-onboarding part, do you know what I mean?  And a broken, no matter what, that will have to happen both for like, both for like what we're working on right now and for the next part, know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah. it would be the same, like, either way, maybe.

48:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's the onboarding for the whole platform, perhaps? Yeah, like a product like growth type thing, like getting credit card or getting the different things or Did they sign up with the credit card?  No, I'm just saying like for future, right?

49:15 - A L
  Like in the future we might need them to sign up with credit card if we Do a product like growth thing.  I'm not sure like I don't know these I feel like I feel like and this is like I think I've been kind of feeling like oh, I need to find work for the development team and like, you know, try to figure this out, but maybe This is not the right time, right?  And maybe it's more for the design that needs to Yeah, it's a product discovery.

49:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's product discovery. Definitely one thing that we are missing. I mean, we don't have any payment or subscriptions in our app or anything And we'll need to have it probably somewhere down the line, but that's something that needs to happen if we want to have a growth without managing anything So yeah, so the subscriptions, the cancellations, the all that stuff and that  will require at least a couple of weeks to implement, maybe even a month or so, just so I know.

50:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, I mean, if we're talking about PLG, we should be talking about who inside of that company will start to use the platform on their own for free, and then we'll champion the platform for the other people.  what Notion did? People start using Notion for their own stuff, and then eventually they go up to their boss to say, look, this is the best.  But they've been using it for a while. So PLG assumes that people use the thing before they need to pay for the thing.  And we need to slice, in the experience, what's the free stuff, what they can do for free, and where do we start to gatekeep things and to, you know, stop them from moving?

50:48 - A L
  Yeah, product led growth is not maybe the, yeah, right way, but maybe onboarding an organization. but I think the point is, there's a lot that we need to figure out in April, or probably May time.  I'm ideally April if we can, but we're going into April now in terms of what it can look like and what it takes because also I'm like I'm not against like going to the, this is why I would like it like kind of like drawn out is not going to go to the pilot customers next week and be like, hey, there's eight things that we need to do as part of basic ones.  I want to work with you guys for eight weeks one week. One week every week on one of these eight things until the summertime where I ask you the information that you need and we actually manually kind of get it and understand what that is and then we kind of like design it off of that like so then like it so then we're like kind of doing it with them and then we also know a little bit more rather than I kind of making assumptions and I kind of building it and then seeing if they want it right so that's also like a feeling that like I hope that we'll be able to do that and that's why I need the buy-in to kind of also show them like this is all the eight that needs to be done and this is why I wanted to update the compliance map so it doesn't seem so overwhelming for them.  meant being like it's actually less work than ISO 14,001 but I need you guys you know as part of this.

52:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I mean we can do that for sure but if the lack of that visual is holding you back maybe we can figure out a kind of a slide design that gives you more speed.

52:17 - A L
  Yeah I think it's actually fine whether it's a slide or it's like a visual I think it's just the point that they want like when you go BSME what is it right like and that visual that I made there like the compliance map is like these are the things that you need to do and I do think like for a compliance map for a person who's new for them to feel more or feel safe in BSME it's like okay I have this box I need to go into this box you know whatever in the back we can decide but to have it broken down my boxes and public areas then it's like okay now this is I understand this is what it is.  Got it. Yeah okay so maybe it's that actually more of a priority then like for this week or like what what do you think we have?  I don't know, I got to go in five minutes sharp.

53:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, in terms of priorities. Well, we have another meeting tomorrow.

53:11 - A L
  So, we can also discuss that, yes. Okay. I don't know. Yeah. But does Romeo do an integrity hub today?  you have enough Romeo until tomorrow until we meet?

53:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

53:32 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay. Yeah.

53:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Romeo has enough stuff for tomorrow. Okay.

53:38 - A L
  Then, yeah, let's go for that then. Okey dokey. Okay. Thank you everyone. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.  Bye bye. Bye Bye Bye Bye bye.
