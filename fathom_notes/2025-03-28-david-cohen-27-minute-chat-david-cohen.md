0:00 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, you were you were muted for a second. So can you hear me now?

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I can Good how about you what time is it there?

0:12 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I am so probably close to you right because you're in Brazil.

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, it's it's it's dark I was recording a podcast episode and I'm trying to I'm trying to get the lighting consistent In the best way, but I don't like I have so many questions about that I saw that on your website and I loved the concept of the podcast.  So I'd love to talk about it a little more, too Yeah, the guy that with a superposition named company would appreciate the exotic matter named podcast for sure.

0:42 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, I really would No, it's a it's super excited. You can tell like my back was pretty plain, but I'm sort of trying to To think about that too because I'm working on my I'm not calling it a podcast because it's more like a game show and we'll talk about I'll explain that  It's something I'm thinking about because I need to spruce up my background.

1:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let's talk more about that game show. that's very cool. this is first time we're talking. And I think somebody suggested my name to you.  I don't remember.

1:27 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  think, honestly, I think I've probably just found you through the LinkedIn algorithm because we have a bunch of people in common.  They're like, you should follow him.

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I will play your profile and here we are.

1:40 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  One of the interesting things I'm finding out as I'm launching the company and everything is that I'm meeting so many cool people in so many different spaces.  If I see somebody that has a similar background to mine or something even cool that I like, I'll hit them up and talk to them and here we are.

1:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it is true, right? The world is full of... Very interesting people So thank you because I'll read that as a compliment, but it was really it was a compliment It was really career changing for me when I started to do to be intentional about that, you know Because at some point and we can get like a more structured introduction but at some point I was like I I need to you know connect to these people that are doing cool things on the internet and You know the scheduling are amazing love them and people start to respond and that was so nice because I work I work from home and I'm not in a big metropolis and So these opportunities to connect with other Weird in a good way people are really valuable and it was a huge  Confidence boost as well. Yeah because then you if you like, okay, maybe my Immediate family doesn't get what I'm doing, but there are people in the world that do get what I'm doing.  You see the valley So that was This was very nice when I started to be serious about that.

3:16 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense And I think that like it's been such a such an eye-opener for me Just like you of like like I can get in touch with so many interesting people Like you said boy in a good way out there and like learn from them It's been like Crazy multiplier from even like myself personally, but also in starting my business I like, you know, each meeting new people kind of getting out there and making friends that like, you know that I can also Bring value to and their lives and like help them sort of grow to it.

3:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's been super cool Yeah, yeah, I think it's one of the best things about this kind of Creating your own home own work is where  doing like cool stuff with cool people and having interesting conversations, because I mean sometimes and maybe this will sound cocky, but I think you won't take it in that way, like you talk to your friends or your family that they have a different kind of job, and you have so many cool interesting conversations in a week that they would need like a year to get that number.  Yeah, I know, I get it. Yeah, so anyway, quick intro on my side, I don't want to make much about myself.  So yes, I create workshops for consultants and expertise businesses, and that's probably how you came across my stuff. And basically, I think my current thesis is knowledge work needs to find new modes because, you know, it's free, instant and infinite, infinite.  So we need to find ways of proving that this is cool to work with us. That's why I like the game show so much because that's exactly in that direction.  And in terms of things that I care about, my search history, my book-buying history, it's expertise, systems, and fun.  Okay. Workshops make sense. Game shows make sense together, right? Yeah. So that's it. And I took a look. made notes from what I could...  I have questions and curious. I want to know, how would you introduce yourself in life? Yeah.

5:39 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  So I've been in the consulting field for over a decade now. So I've primarily worked in big consulting firms and also in boutique firms more recently.  But I primarily specialize in data and AI strategy. And really fell in love with sort of workshops and just general collaborative settings.  That's a driver for that work. in big firms over the course. I really started at Accenture, if you know that firm, and that's where I really felt low with it.  in smaller firms, I really realized the power that that sort of setting had for discussions around data and discussions around AI and how to make them real for really meaningful, I would call it small to medium organizations versus the Fortune 500 companies of the world who basically have all the resources and means in the world to make that happen.  What I realized also in that journey is that there were not that many people to serve the smaller, I'm calling them less data literary organizations that like have the want or the interest in getting there but don't have the know-how or the help to kind of navigate.  So from the perspective of, you know, as you said, engaging in sort of fun different ways and navigating the consulting model in a very  be appropriate way for 2025 is what I launched my company to do because it feels like, as you said, I also share that that from a consulting model perspective, there's a time for a refresh of how we work.  you and I have the flexibility that we can work differently and we can work in both in our approach, in our output, but also in how we structure like the financial side of everything, also the like back and forth with our clients.  There's ways that we can work and do things that bigger firms just can't base on their sides. And I think that there's an interesting evolution of the model that we can help push.  obviously, that's partly why I was so interested to talk to you is I think we share kind of a shared mission, if you will, which is what you said.

7:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I felt a lot of yeah shared shared Shared ideas probably shared references, you know, I don't know I don't know what what's like your score on like personality things I found that oftentimes there's like significant match when these conversations begin on such a Because this is very niche right this thing we're interested in right now It's a combination of curiosities that more people have it but it's Not super common and when we get to talk, it's usually a Signal that there are other things that in our perspective what we pay attention to we look at the world But so let me ask a few questions and Because so I took a look at a toy site and I like them I like the teas and I like that and that the name may made all the sense when I got into it.  Yeah, and But one aspect that and I wasn't super clear on right so take it now that's helpful so if I'm a company let's say let's say let's role play this this is not a test right we're just playing let's say I'm a small company I've been bombarded with like AI data you need data for AI and AI for data you need all these things and you need to do it today you're falling behind and so on right and I get it I buy that this is a lack that I have and I don't know how to get started right and I call you let's imagine it's 99 I call you and I say so okay David can you help me get you know data literate what's what's is this like a realistic situation yeah so what happens typically is not that somebody

10:00 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  calls and is like, I want to get data literate, right? It's not that general, guess. That typically happens. And this is something that I recognize that I need to narrow down on the messaging in the website is that people call it to solve very specific narrow problems with their data.  data literate journey happens sort of sideways as a result, or not sideways, but in parallel as a result of a narrow problem that you're trying to solve.  So you wouldn't call me and be like, say, I want to get data literate, you might call me and be like, I want to build my go to market strategy, or I want to build a dashboard, or I want to understand my positioning in my market as it relates to my use of analytics and data, or I want to build a product in AI, right?  or with AI. And I don't know what that looks like, or how I, how I even approach or get the tools to do that.  So the, the journey to, to do that become literate in that space is actually not focused on, and this is something I stress with my clients.  It's not it's not a broad journey of like getting literate. It's solving real problems for real people and helping them build things that make their lives easier while also understanding that there's like a bigger value there beyond just like building things.  So my my role is more we use the workshop construct of real problems in the data in AI space versus just talking about it ethereally I guess.

11:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So would it make sense to think that there's a little bit of it that's like a trojan horse?

11:42 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  people want something but they they get yeah I think that's a that's a very good metaphor in the sense of the the sort of workshop construct and then the like fun game moves and then like the back and forth that sort of meeting is really a trojan horse.  For us is a good way of putting it for like, you know, a deeper discussion around like, how are you and how are you understanding your data today and how are you telling stories with it?  That's what I'm an expert in and like data visualization data storytelling. So that the what what fascinates me about the workshop construct is the ability to basically show and not tell somebody a construct around anything really.  But in my case, it's you know, my work is in data and AI enablement and that has taken many evolutions over the years in my years in consulting.  And now it's, you know, people freaking out because they can't get the most out of their data. They can't get the most out of AI and they hear about it everywhere.  it's like a gamified representation of how how you might get there because in our line of work, I find that people really struggle to understand the frameworks because we tend to also this is something I want to change in how we percent.  We tend to lead with a framework with a solution when we and the resulting world go go to market and what I find is that people don't care right because nobody cares about the how they care about the what so like when when when we talk and when we percent and how I go to market myself is the the tools are just an enablement of the solution which is the as you said it's not really the star of the show to be like you know you you come to me I'll make you more data literate well I will do is like solve a very narrow specific problem for you on your data yeah for sure for sure there's um okay there's a lot of impact there so one of the things that you've made me think of was um I really like that idea of just in case knowledge versus just in time knowledge yeah cool it's just in case right and when you have these like more hands-on project oriented problem solving based um you know the thing you

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  see not theoretically, but you see the decisions that influences and you see how things relate to each other. So I like that image.  And so there's another thing that I was intrigued by. you come at this from, in a technical perspective, from data, right?  And then you've mixed with that which think is very cool. You mixed with that facilitation skills and having these conversations and grading experiences.  And I like the word construct to have framings or to have these discussions, right? Yeah. In a way that's productive and, you know, get something out of it.  But he's not, you know, super, super dry. So you are very, because I've seen that the mirrors and the stuff, you're very, competent at the workshop in facilitating kind of thing, right?  But my question is, you live with the data, right? That's mostly the thing that is at your edge, like data and...

15:13 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  So to give you some sense of what my background is, also on the data side, in my early years, especially in consulting, I've built a lot of tools in the data space, a lot of dashboards in particular.  So I'm an expert in dashboard design and in building dashboards in Tableau or Power BI, for instance. So what you realize in doing that too is that there's a lot of overlap between the way that you build tools for data and that you do this sort of dashboard work.  It's like all about presenting information, really. And so the blending of those two worlds is that I can have a conversation with somebody about anything and structure it in the same way that I would a dashboard to tell a story with or without quantitative.  data. That's another thing that I specialize in. Most people think of data in the space as numbers, like tables.  the data world, the nerdy term, guess, that we would call it is structured data. There's also unstructured data, which is pictures, ideas, emotions, video, whatever form that is not a table.  What I find is that the workshops end up bringing in a lot of unstructured data. That's how you organize, how you get something out of it, and you can even bring structured data in.  You can bring data points, can bring dashboard factors, you can bring whatever into the experiences. The interesting thing for me, from a positioning standpoint, is that I can bring those two worlds together because I can have a conversation with your CEO about whatever topic, but I can also discuss knowledgeably what it's going to take for you to get the data that you're bringing in order to get there.  Because that conversation happens, or when... you and I in a traditional setting said that conversation what happens a lot to me is that you have a very cool very interesting conversation with the CEO or the CEO and then the chief technology officer or chief data person in the background will be rolling their eyes because it's like you know they can't make happen what the CEO wants to happen so there's like a connection that needs to be made there of like you know the person that's making the big picture decisions doesn't understand the the dirty work that it's going to take to get the dirty work doesn't appreciate necessarily the picture stuff as much okay so there's someone I need to introduce you to his name is Tom Kerwin he's from the UK and he's been developing a methodology he showed me the other day is deeper than what you had time to explain to me but I think it was very good because it mixed exactly these things it mixed like the the zoom levels

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and Storytelling as a backbone. Yeah, so I think you'll like it. I'll like it I'll make a I'll ask him because I like to make warm intros, but I'm sure you'll be open to so Yes, yes, I have this this client right now it's not even my like my perfect ICP but it's it's close enough for the stage of the company.  I'm it I'm at right now and and sometimes so they're developing a product right and sometimes It's their first product.  They're like a corporate person that is launching a product and there's a whole set of failure modes From on that on that position like people.  Yeah, I have a similar client myself actually Yeah, people trick up in Common ways and they always think that's different You see the patterns, but anyway, so a fun thing is So we are doing the project and she sometimes mentions AI as  magic, right? No, you can just, you can just use AI and AI will do it. I, feel like I'm, I, I dabbled with AI since before chat, I think I know enough to know what I don't know.  It's just that kind of conscious incompetence. I was like, look, AI is, it's cool. But there's ways of implementing it.  But it's, it's not just like AI, you know, yeah, yeah, sure. We'll figure that out later. And it's so, and I think part of the reason why she's staying on this track for so long is that we are in between CTOs.  So there's not the guy that will need to implement that to pull her back. So she's fully visionary CEO mode.  And yeah, I can really see that conversation taking place. Sorry, this is a little bit of a monologue.

19:54 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  No, I need to apologize.

19:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do that a lot. Actually, I'm at the stage that sometimes stop myself from apologizing for apologizing. great. It's my South European Catholic of bringing, being from South America myself, I get like this position and like the way that works.  Oh, you are from South America originally? Yeah, I'm Venezuelan.

20:26 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I don't speak Portuguese, so you know, then want to lead with the English, but if you speak Spanish, a Spanish speaker myself actually.

20:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, now I speak bad Spanish. think my English and your English are closer than your Spanish and my Spanish.  Fair enough.

20:42 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, that's my Portuguese and your Portuguese are different.

20:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, so so, okay, there's so much stuff and I'm trying to be practical. I'd also love to continue talking about

21:00 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Time by the way like it don't have to like try to cram.

21:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah the next 10 minutes true true true, but so Tell me tell me more about Like you there's the question.  I think it's from Picasso when art critics get together. Yeah, they talk about paintings And painters get together to talk about where to buy cheap turpentine so Let's talk about where to buy cheap turpentine.  How is it going for you like this? Yeah, but a unique business I also have a unique business How has that been for you?

21:34 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  It's a weird challenge for me because it's it's a it's like a it's been a mind-shift of I've been doing good for a long time And when you work under a brand there is a Different process for selling that is in many ways easier because but like the brand especially a big brand sells itself Like you don't have to sell anything you just go places and people know you When you're by yourself  Especially in the in the knowledge workspace as you called it What we're selling is us like our expertise our capability and the way we drive conversations with clients and help them Right.  So that journey for me has been a big change in that like at the end of the day What I'm selling is is me so like I should I should put my personality out there I should you know be be who I am and the way I think about the world And that has been a big change because I was joking about this with many other people I've talked to I feel like when you work at a big consulting firm, they hammer this like fear of Branding into you You are like, you know, you know, this I'm sure very well having worked in other consultancies You are like a representation of the bigger brand and then yours just me So like that that journey has been weird and so that's that's how the the game show idea actually started is I wanted to brand my I want to brand my company as  Or in a way that showcases to everyone, like not just my ICP, the brand being like fun, being engaging, being data driven, if you will, but also has the factor of bringing people together.  I want to show people what I do versus tell them. So that's where the idea came from.

23:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's very cool. And how is it going in terms of what's your plans for that game show?

23:34 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, so right now I'm in the early stages of developing the, so basically I'm going to run it through Miro is the short version because I use a lot of that tool for building it.  So I'm building basically the game board. The way I'm envisioning it is that it would be different episodes for expertise topics.  So I might invite workshop facilitators. So I know you. I also know a couple other people in this space.  invite you for like to play games on that topic, right? And we would have conversations about like, you know, what is it like to be a workshop facilitator?  Who are the people that inspire you? Like what, what bothers you about your job, that sort of thing? And it would be a power of like back and forth games where I'm not really the star of the show.  The star of the show is the framework, right, just to have people come together that don't know each other or that are in, are in like, parallel spaces to play games and kind of come together and share.  Because I feel in a professional setting, there's, there's a space missing where everything like podcast setting is tried and true, right?  Like people know what it is and you learn. But the people in the podcast also from the perspective of who they meet and what they do, don't really get that much out of it other than like getting their whatever they're talking about out there.  So like learning from others is It does happen in that you're kind of going back and forth with a podcast post But there's also the the element missing of other people in that in that equation if that makes sense And so my my idea is to bring that together to to make that happen.  Sorry.

25:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't mean to interrupt you No, no, no, no, I was I was the one interrupting So first one really really good idea and I think my best compliment is that I'm a bit jealous.  It's a really good idea sure and And now a couple of observations so Do you know the internet the dev internet theory, right?  So we're getting there for sure. Yeah I think I have like three years to make friends online Oh, and then we and then we don't know if people are real so I have anything at a lot about this because I usually have conversations like this one-on-one with people and I love them and I always oh, I I always it's like my notes.  They always have a corner Or it's like people I need to introduce people to right. Yeah, it's something I have to do And I've been thinking like it would be fun to  get together and maybe like get two people three people not 15 but just to do something together because we have to make the friends online before this becomes socially hostile right and that idea of you know playing a game together it's so good it's it's it's amazing it's really like it and I think it's very contemporary yeah obviously I'd love to have you on it if you would love to love to be on it yeah especially go ahead no there's a person I don't know if you know him is the facilitator on LinkedIn Said Said uh it's from Berlin and I think you'll like his stuff because he talks a lot about using Miro as a as a game or as a play tool yeah so he has all these tricks with OBS and Miro boards I think you'll you'll like his stuff yeah if you can share his information or if you know him if you would facilitate an intro to him too I would that would be helpful

27:00 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Uh-huh, for sure, for sure, we'll do.

27:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, this is, yeah, really nice. So let me tell on my side, I've been kind of interviewing you.

27:11 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I guess I would love to hear about your stuff. And I can stay longer, by the way, if you're able to as well.

27:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I have a couple of extra minutes. So, any specific thing you want me to start with or just go?  No, mean, we talked a lot about your work.

27:26 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I actually would love to hear more about the podcast, too, since that's in development. I was curious that you're launching it in June, particular, with, like, kind of, I'm assuming you're, like, building up a stable of episodes before you launch, right?

27:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so that's an interesting question. So, basically, I don't want to have a podcast. I just won't have podcast episodes out, right?  Okay. And what I thought was, this is the first time I'm doing it. And, know, I've said there's a lot is going to take longer than what I think it will take.  And And I was like, I really appreciate the act of knowing how different things are made. So I like to write, I like to draw.  This is a workshop, a mobile workshop inside of my office is turned around. you know, it's, I like to do those things.  And I was like, I wish I could know what it is to have made a podcast. So that's what I did.  And then when thinking about what kind of podcast do I want to do? I thought about this perspective of knowledge work is changing.  there's some people have seen it. And some others, I think are in I mean, I live it.

28:45 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  So it makes a lot of sense to me.

28:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, exactly. I think I think you are one of, I think I put it in for for season two.  I just wrote it down because, because, yeah, that is is that perspective you know what I'm talking about. And there's some people that really get it.  So for now I've been interviewing our like you know friends that get it and people that I've spoken to before and I knew we would be have fun and get interesting conversations.  If we get to second season it seems that I will do it eventually but I'm not sure. If we get to it I think I can get even more niche because like you are more niche than what I've been talking about.  Anyway it's something I wanted to do and that's it. I never did it or there's so much stuff to do and I'm always with like side project is kind of a problem.  So what I've learned in terms of being productive as a creative person is because I'm always busy I'm always making things but I don't necessarily take them to shipping stage right?  They stay in some folder. I'm like, this is a bad pattern. because I might as well be doing something else.  mean, I like creative work, but I could be doing something else. Or I could get something out of the things that I do.  So I need to ship. Sure. And yeah, now I have a limit. I have only three projects at the of the time.  And I'm dying to finish the podcast season so I can do the other things. Right. So not because I don't want to do podcasts.

30:26 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Are you going to release them all at once? Or are you going to release them once a week or once a month, or what?

30:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's going to be once a week. And I think I will release maybe some clips for the people involved.  Nice. And also, yeah, it's kind of a low stakes thing in the sense that even the people participating, I'm telling them, look, I'm aiming for June, it's probably a case of under promise over the lever.  Because I'm using Riverside. I don't know if you've used it. I have.

30:54 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I'm actually considering it for the game show too. So I would love to know how you like using it.

31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's really amazing. works really well. I haven't edited anything yet, but it feels really, really good. So it's impressive how we know.  It seems to make a lot of things much easier. So yeah, that's it about the podcast. And no, I love it.

31:23 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  And I'd love to be in it if you need a, you know, guess for the second season, I guess, if you do make it.

31:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think what you have fits perfectly with that. I put even the first season to for sure. And I don't know when that would happen, but it makes so much sense with what you're telling me.  Yeah.

31:45 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  And I guess the other question would be for your day work, I guess. How are you finding it also?  we talked a lot about like my experience, I'm curious to get yours of like, how are you finding it to if you build and get clients?  And so I guess.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  really you know sort of that journey of it's a it's a new not a new space but a niche space as you said so would be curious to hear that how that goes for you too for sure for sure so so the first thing is I think I think I've been spinning my wheels for a little bit you know to be honest and now I'm getting more traction and I think the reason I spun my wheels for so long was uh I didn't have a good understanding on how to talk about this who would need this I was very skills oriented like hey I do workshops is how you do my content was about that and luckily I kept talking to people and to you know learn as much as I could and I started to to get tips and feedback about I want to talk about this right talk about this in terms of that the other that the audience understands  the audience doesn't know anything about workshops. But when I say, hey, here are five workshop exercises, this is just for workshopping people.  This is not for my audience right there. That is a shift because when you're on the pressure and you're in great content, you go towards what's easy, what's easy is what the tech tools and skills you already have.  But then I started to do customer discovery interviews with people like, tell me about your thing, and they would tell me what was difficult.  I haven't done so many of them, but it's amazing how much you get out of your own head in terms of, oh, okay, so maybe I should talk about this in these terms.  That was helpful. Another thing that was helpful as well was committing, so LinkedIn is a , no reach. I use words, words for LinkedIn all the time.  It's a love-hate relationship, a lot of hate. and but I've made a commitment to myself to I want to post every business day for the first quarter I started a little bit better so I'm still I still have a few days to go so but the thing is I've been doing that and I've learned a lot not because LinkedIn is you know I think I've gained maybe 300 followers for three months of almost daily posting and I don't think that's great ROI but it's really sharp and the way I talk about these things yeah so that was good as well another thing that has been helpful was and I feel that this is a common failure mode for nerds which is like we overvalue the the skill or the you know the technical aspects and we under we undervalue like marketing yeah and  And for instance, one of the things that was really illuminating, just yesterday I had a conversation that was really illuminating, which was, I was talking to somebody, they were helping me in change for some other help.  And I was telling them, oh yeah, I'm aiming at agencies because I think agencies are easy to find online.  And boutique consulting companies are smaller, they're not so present. And the guy said, no, no, no, let me show you.  He opened the, he shared the screen on LinkedIn Sales Navigator and he showed me, showed it to me. And I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I've been going about this, finding people in a kind of naive way, publish content and see if I will show it to the people.  But those like five minutes, was like, you know what, yeah, maybe I should just pay for LinkedIn Sales Navigator and find the audience that I need and then I get engaged with them in a very intentional way.  this is an example of. solution was not for me to make better content or the solution it helps up to appointing other things but not for growing my audience right so that was also turning point not this only thing but getting understanding like even if the thing i'm doing is kind of new it fits within a box that is not that new so there are best practices around this and trying to connect with people this has been helpful maybe this helpful to you as well i've been trying to connect with people that help my target market so i'm not a i'm not a competitor and like for instance positioning experts i know a lot of positioning experts i understand positioning but i'm not about doing positioning and i'm not a threat right and they're like oh that that's an easy conversation to have and and it also  Fits with the kind of problems they help their clients with So they are helping an advisory firm position Which will mean that you'll need they will need to talk about their services in a different way And maybe they'll need to know productize their services up to a point But the positioning guys don't do that and say this guy might do it.

  know, sure That's helpful Well Yeah, I mean, no, that's really fascinating because I like obviously in many of the same ways have Kind of landed many of the same spots that that you have on that front I am I used Lincoln cells navigator pretty heavily in my last job And so the that kind of seeing it happen like that and being more intentional as you said about like who I'm targeting It's what's next for me.  Like I'm getting there, but I don't I haven't Officially launched my company even so it's

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like uh um that will be the next step of like reaching the right people versus just reaching anybody now i'm in the reach anybody stage so by by luck i guess i'm landing on some of the right people but you know i want to land on the right people more often so your parents have to be more intentional about who you reach out to yeah yeah absolutely and and it's really i mean at some point this this starts to be kind of a personal almost spiritual journey right uh finding your place in the world and today is where you feel like a million bucks today is where you're like oh i'm not sure i'm doing the right thing yeah i know kind of it's it's it's part for the course i think so just just before i was talking to i was interviewing for the podcast a guy that has a newsletter i'll recommend to you yeah and he is an advisor to two agents two consultants boutique consultant and we were talking about these patterns  like especially like that guy then is specialized in X corporate people like they just they were director or VP of something and now they're studying and there are like signals that they will do well or they are not on the right track like patterns you know so that's that's always interesting and I think some of my my I keep using these words my favorite modes at the start were I thought and I was thinking about this today earlier today so there's no way of saying this without coming across as a bit of a jerk we are both clever people and we are used to going through life knowing that we're clever people so sometimes at least on my side when faced with a problem my go-to strategy is to press the clever button  and think about something really smart, like, oh, I need a product, you know? And that's a blind spot, because oftentimes that's not the right strategy for that problem.  That problem is not a complex problem. You know, the Kunevin kind of thing? Okay, so that problem is not a complex problem.  That's a best practices thing. Just follow the best practices. Don't try to learn things from first principles. And I've noticed that, I think that's what I did for a long time, which is when faced with a new problem in the domain I didn't understand, I'd go to strategy, would be to try to really understand it and come across with, oh, something that no one has ever seen before, which is very good at attracting like-minded people, but very bad at, you know, connecting with people that think in different ways.- Well, that's right.

  What I really thought of me is- One, you're cutting off.

41:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're cutting off. Can you repeat?

41:04 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  Yeah, can you hear me? Hello? Yes.

41:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, so it really helped me on that front with like two realizations basically.

41:11 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  One was that every client is a good client. In the sense of like, I wanted to help everybody when I started this and I realized that like, I can't come up with a clever solution to everything, like you said.  Yeah, yeah. maybe my solution isn't good for everyone. So like having the like ego shift of help everybody and not everybody and so that right?  I help everybody with everything. I have to know other people that can help those. I can make the connection and help those people have that that that path to get the right person for who they need.  But that might not be

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  be me like I thought the helper for everything and like I might be the person you call to help you with any consulting problem and I'm realizing that's not it and then that's okay and it's just healthy right yeah true it's true very much true also it alleviates that pressure of I gotta say smart things really quickly otherwise still not want to work with me yeah like it's okay that you don't know something yeah and you don't need to generalize things like this is a thing I've done a lot like try to be oh I guys just press shoot it in and so quickly got what was the the thinking point and sometimes it wasn't and I need to reveal that lost political capital like oh I think what's wrong is this thing no it's not that thing let's try that thing I'm sorry you know but yeah like I said it's a very personal journey and it gets weird when you talk to people that have their own another way of you know earning a living but more perhaps traditional  And because my wife, she's also like kind of an independent consultant on a different thing, so in our home, we talk about this kind of thing all the time, and we both work from home and have a lot of flexibility, and at some points we're like, well, this is a lifestyle we've built.  But sometimes it gets hard to relate. It's hard for other people to relate to that. We just feel like you don't work or you do whatever you want.  It's really not like that. Sorry, I've been talking a lot. I this type of conversation anyway.

43:34 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  I get so much out of this too, so you don't have to apologize like I said.

43:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Again, right?

43:42 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
  But anyways, no, I mean, I'd love to stay in touch. obviously there's a lot we have in common, so as we both continue growing, we'd love to just continue going back and forth on ideas.  if you have anything that you think might be useful, and I'll do the same, please go ahead and share it.  don't hesitate to.

44:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, for sure. Yeah, I'm interested in that.

44:33 - David Cohen (superpositionstrat.com)
