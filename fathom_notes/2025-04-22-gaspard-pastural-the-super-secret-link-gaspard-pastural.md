0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello, how are you guys talking? Good, thank you for being here for this. have so many questions. We never talked.

0:15 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  It's the first time we talk, I think.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, it is. We sent some just back and forth, but we never got to talk.

0:26 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I like to use letters, so I've been throwing you questions. I've been throwing you questions, I think I like it.

0:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for saying that. As you know, sometimes we say things into the void. Nothing comes back and you're like, nobody's seeing this, but it's very nice that you say that.  But I don't remember where you're from.

0:50 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I am Portuguese, but I live in Brazil.

0:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I thought there were four enemies.

0:57 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Come again?

0:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I thought there were four enemies.

1:00 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  enemies, like a Brazilian friend who told me no, Portuguese and Brazilian or whatever. Yeah, yeah.

1:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now the thing is, right now there's a lot of Brazilians in Portugal and I think Portugal is not used to be a country that receives immigrants.  I think France is, but Portugal is not. So this is kind of a new thing for us. And especially the older people, they can be xenophobic and racist.  So I think some Brazilians are facing that and yeah, they're not too happy about it, which I understand. And there's also the whole colonization thing like being discussed.  I think these are all things that France has debated way before, but it's kind of a new thing for us.  yeah, society is adjusting. But I live in Brazil and I mean, I've been living here for 12 years. Twice only twice I've had like bad interactions because I'm Portuguese.  So I would say it's it's always good So it's uncommon that people Have trouble with it, but anyway Yeah, it's it's good it's good.  I like it I liked here and So let me give you a little bit of context around the boat and the whole thing.  I think it's fair So if you've been following the newsletter, you've seen that, you know, I talk about workshops and consultants and things I've realized is that Given an intersection that I don't see so many people there are others, but it's not super common You know, so the intersection of workshops for consulting you see a lot of people talking about consulting It's a lot of people talking about the workshops, but mixing these two things so far doesn't seem very common and  that I'm very wrong, or maybe I'm early, I don't know. I hope I'm early, early. And so what I was thinking was, I should write a book and get people to know what I think about this thing.  And I read a book about writing books. It's very good. If you think about writing a book, I really recommend this, OK?  I'm sure. One of the things that the book says that is a good process to write the book is that you should interview people that are doing the thing that you want to teach to see how they think about it, to get out of your own head.  And you should also have conversations where you'd like to teach the materials of the book, like you're testing the book, right?  For this conversation, because I've seen in your content, you have run workshops, so you have experience with taking your expertise and packaging it into a workshop.  So I have a lot of questions. printed script. I have questions about how this became a part of your method, like how workshops became part of the way you do work.  And that's a context, that's a context for this conversation. So thank you for being open to it. No worries about that.

4:18 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I remember the book, how to write successful books or useful books.

4:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

4:23 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  And the same author of the book about how to run a workshop.

4:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's crazy. Rob Fitzpatrick. Exactly. When I see stuff, I have a mix between jealous and like, oh my God, it's just like me.  But he's ahead, of course. But yeah, I like his stuff. like his stuff. The thing about the workshop book that he wrote is that it's mostly workshops for teaching.  It's not so much workshops for figuring out out things together. So there's like these two different kinds of workshops.  It's more about, you know, participatory teaching, giving people an opportunity to, you know, apply what they're learning when they are learning it.  So, but yeah, I really like it. It's very good. That's the book. That's the book. So, Gaspar, without further ado, I'll just give you kind of a sense.  The first thing is like, how did you realize that maybe a workshop would be a useful way for you to do your thing?

5:42 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I've seen it in agencies. maybe to give you a bit of background, I worked with marketing agencies. Like, I was doing another job like a few years ago and I paid with it because I've seen it arrived and I said, oh, I did something more stable.  went and I experimented and by going through multiple agencies, like four, five in government, like jump from one to the other every six months just to learn.  And I saw that the workshop was a nice kid magnet, first to get a first step in the door and I was kind of the agency model, kind of test the expertise, like an audit or something.  And so when I went as a freelancer, I often did audits, like a workshop based then. And it's, even if I, when I don't offer it, when I go into conversation, I see it as a way to, okay, if you're not ready to buy the full packets, it's a way for me to offer, like the offer.  And you should say, oh, that's better now, it's the lighter way. currently, to give you a bit more context as well, I'm repackaging my offers.  So I want to have one workshop as my entry point. I'm, I've been, I've done it recently. It's, I put my profile like two days ago, and that's the workshop for the positionings, what I do, like an audit.  And how I see it as a help for me to get clients is because it's not so I don't I use it to prove my expertise but also show the problem and reinforce why they should actually fix it.  That's how I see it. That's why I want to use it. I'm not sure about the pricing. I'm not sure about the funnel because I didn't have any clients for it yet.  Most workshops are really concrete, like on actionable stuff whereas positioning is not always my entry point whereas that's my course.  It isn't the entry, so I'm trying to figure this out a little bit. That's the context.

7:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's good. All of it was good, but I was especially intrigued at the end because other people have questions about the pricing aspect.  And also correct me if I'm wrong. What I understood was that you do positioning, but...

8:00 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  the workshop so this is the thing I'm not sure you do position that's how I see you on LinkedIn right but you said that your workshop your audits are not about positioning yeah so far I'm posting on positioning etc and I got a few clients on this part launched this my own business like two years ago yeah at the time I growth marketing acquisition operations like I've been able to get some leads from this reputation I had and network I have so even if I do get conversations where usually people don't want something strategic they want a device on okay I'm doing this it doesn't work how can I improve it okay you don't realize the positioning so I also like a light first audit workshop or something on the channel you want me to work it like I called emails are content something and then when we turn this  everything and say oh but you should work on the positioning and then they get interested into this that's why the pricing I'm not sure because the clients out for this were usually either inbound or in-force so it's easier for me to sell because I can say my price could be twice the one I put on LinkedIn but when I post on LinkedIn I want to get people that don't know me yet to buy my my first offer like to get to trust me once and I'm not sure because it's the difference in wealth approach that if I met a client a lead from an intro he has more trust in me so I can twice hire it as mine because you know that is I'm coming from a reliable reliable source otherwise it's from LinkedIn I'm not sure because I don't see many leads ready to buy right away got it got it I have the same thing I know what you mean I know what you mean and it's for me a bit of a tension point because if I talk about workshops my expectation is that people

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that I will have an workshop for workshops, right? Yeah. It feels that it makes sense. But the difficult part for me to package the workshop into a workshop, and I think maybe this is similar in a sense, is that positioning is also quite broad.  mean, there's a discipline to it, but it's quite broad, it can touch on many things. In a sense, that's in my interpretation.  So I'm talking about how I think about your world, correct me if I think I'm wrong. But in my interpretation, so positioning is really, really strategic.  mean, I remember reading the Al-Ri's books like five years ago, and then I like the topic of positioning, and I agree it's like super powerful, a bit vague sometimes, and people like, they don't know what it is, think it's messaging, but it's more messaging, know, stuff like that.  So in my position, of workshops. I'm always like, yeah the people that come to me because they know me or they know somebody that knows me, they're more flexible to the idea of I don't know exactly what you do but I'll trust you and we'll figure it out and those conversations for me they are much more natural and also I don't struggle so much with saying exactly what we'll get at the end in terms of deliverables right?  the deliverables like even in my case like workshops there's a set of deliverables that are kind of obvious like oh you get the canvas, you get the instructions, you get the assets to print or to use on the mirror board things are kind of obvious but sometimes it's not they don't really get the workshop they get something else right so I empathize with what I still is your attention about this.  People that know me we can have a more exploratory conversation, people that don't know me, they want like something quick to just swipe the credit card and says, I paid it, get that.  Yeah.

12:07 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  So, yeah, I see exactly, and that's funny, we read the same books. Yeah, it's exactly the problem that I'm working on because I have too many clients from inbound only, like with a mouth and a few referrals.  I'm posting my name, I don't see results from it. And I think it comes from how easy it is for them to buy from me.  So, I'm considering doing like a workshop, like a group workshop or something, something like a low commitment, like a lay-on and paid audit or a webinar, something to then set the audits, like multiple steps.  I'm not sure yet, so I'm working on this book. That's, and also I don't know if I should maybe change my scope or something, I said, positioning is quite big.  And I've also tried to find my audience, so I'm working with founders quite early, but not that early, so it's a bit of a weird scope, so some are really advanced, are not.  So I'm trying to find the denominator or something that links them together, and that's what I'm looking at. So you know everything, so if you have any questions that's your list, know the white answers.  Yeah, yeah.

13:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now I don't know how I feel about this, but I sometimes feel a bit self-conscious about talking about workshops, because I'm pretty confident in my workshop skill, but I'm not the best guy in the world about workshops.  And though the best guys in the world are online as well, people can find them. And I need to frame this the way I come across in a way that there's a uniqueness that is not just competitive, like who's the  best because I'm not the best workshop guy in the world, but there's an extension of finding an audience, pleasing the algorithm so it shows your stuff to people, but at the same time so it to people that would buy.  For instance, I'm learning that I love talking to independent consultants or solos, but they're not good business because they're like me.  They're will get the book, but they will not buy the service. So yeah, is this the same for you?  No, but I've talked with someone that's called Max Trailer. I know Max.

14:40 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Yeah, you know him? He's working with a but that was a bad niche for him, and I think it's where he's the same.  think maybe your niche could be agencies.

14:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm aiming more at agencies. And yes, when I found when I discovered Max initially, he was talking much more to consultants and now he's like full-on agencies and I'm doing something similar.  it makes sense okay um so i want to keep us in time because there is generous of you so i'll just jump to another direction of exploring i think it's our catholic upbringing um so you've had experience with the workshops yeah at the agencies and you saw that they and they worked really well for these building trusts with clients initially and also you know they give you a lot of data from what's happening at your client's world and they give you an opportunity to to show up okay and did you when you started to offer your own like for your own company your own workshops you you you learned that from the book from rock physical  How did you learn about how to do that?

16:02 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Well, I did some agencies, so I was quite... Practical, And I didn't actually learn, I just did it. I mean, I prepare my stuff, I know my stuff, I didn't know it beforehand, so I don't comment yet, so it's quite clear.  The real difference between agencies and solos, and I discovered that, is that agencies, you don't really care about the pricing, because you are trying to get leads.  So it's a way to ease the conversation. Like the agencies that were working out, they were really losing money on workshops.  But because we had retainers, we had many people working for ongoing clients, we could afford to lose money on workshops because they were to close clients, or to retain them longer afterwards, you know, these kind of things.  The workshop was really useful for the customers already, because the... quite time-consuming to create for each customer because they're all different.  So it was really more of a lead, a funnel, or a lead magnet kind of a way to help people buy from us.  Whereas when I'm a consultant, solo is the opposite. I don't have the time, I can't afford to give free workshops.  Yes.

17:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or it's more, I'm doing the opposite.

17:21 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I've sell really premium workshops, really premiums. I raise the testing and that's how it's the main difference. I can even say I don't mind if they don't want to pay.  I'm just going to cut them a deal and or sell them later. I'm going to rebuild them or make an offer or something.  And it's really actionable. So they see the result and they can end on a roadmap. So it's easy for them to see how to work with them afterward.  For as a solo, at the end of my workshops, I don't offer any roadmap. I do offer a roadmap recommendations, but I won't implement it because I'm not doing any work afterwards.  I'm just inviting. So it's more of a... I want them to pay for this expertise because that's why I'm giving everything I know in this package.  it's different than I and that's why I was struggling at the beginning.

18:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tell me more about your struggling at the beginning.

18:13 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  At the beginning, when I switched from agencies after the workshop, and because my service was consulting and not services, going to work, I was at loss in terms of, okay, at the end of the workshop, they will not sign it for me or anything.  So at agencies, after the workshop, they say, oh, it's really clear, can you do it for us? Okay, you implement everything for them, and you pay for it, and they send a retainer, and then become a long-term client, like a SaaS model, like a software.  So you're profitable because in the end, you invested some time in the workshops, but you can get money back as well.  When I'm a solo, that's why at the beginning, I often do free workshops to get started. But actually, they've got new worst clients where they got what they do, answers they wanted on it.  our team what to do. And then because I didn't implement it, they wanted to do it themselves. So I did stop doing free workshop and I did only read 80 ones only.  And that was fine. That's what I'm doing right now. But I think there are two kinds of workshops, the ones that are here to make your clients or the ones that here to be your living.

19:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yes. And that's such a that's such a existential definition, right?

19:32 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  you're here for real, that's why I think your clients would be more agencies because the solos, they do the workshops and they're paid for it and they don't see the problem because they don't do anything afterwards.  Whereas when you're in an agency at the end, you have to close. So you're kind of at this pressure to do the workshop well.

19:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

19:53 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Or to offer valuable workshops or attractive people with the workshop and it's more direction on this topic as well.  I thought about the agency when we talked. No, I agree.

20:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  agree. And thank you for saying that. Do you offer retainers for your work?

20:11 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Yes, like other things, a number of hours per week, and I'm packaging a few developers in Notion. I'm working on a few dashboard, stuff, frameworks, but not really nothing really actionable, just to help founders think.  So it's just like one of the things I'm offering, and I'm considering offering a cohort, like a group. But I don't have the volume yet to solve the problem.

20:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I haven't run a cohort, I wouldn't know. But I think the same way about that, need a certain volume to make a cohort cool.  Otherwise, it feels a bit sad, like three people.

20:57 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  That wouldn't be too bad if it really was useful. Well, but even three people would be like, all my clients are in different stages, so I don't think people who are not competitors, so it's really, like, if they're being in a problem, I don't mind, but I would be at last if I was targeting only two early founders or like, it's a balance of pricing and profitability, I think.  I mean, I think it would be ideal for me, because that's easy for me to dive into, to get more value out of me, I don't know, like, 35 would be ideal.

21:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good point, because if you have a lot of variability, by having a huge cohort, that thing gets averaged out, but if the cohort is small and you have a lot of variability, it's difficult.  I was working with someone recently, also marketing consultant, and he had exactly this issue that you're talking about, was like, all my clients are a little bit different.  And experts usually see these differences better than the clients themselves, right? yeah, the same thing, like, for some clients, this would be the approach.  For some clients, this would be the approach. cannot get these two guys in the same room at the same time because it's going to be tricky.  But so the reason for my question was, the way we've been talking about workshops here has been a lot around the business objective of a workshop, client acquisition, right, in this sense.  That's how we've been talking and thinking about it. And one of things you've mentioned about the agencies was that, you know, agencies can afford to lose money on a workshop because then you have the retainers and you have to do the work stage and they recoup the money on that.  And then I asked you, you have retainers and you said, I'm having more retainers now, I sensed that this is...  something you're still, you know, calibrating somehow, like the new retainers you have, okay.

23:07 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Well, it's, it's, it's hard to put a price on retainer for advisory. Different type of funders I would pay for the device.  Yes. It's, at this day, everyone's looking at profitability and cutting expenses. It would be like paying for coaching, you know.  Yeah. So I didn't find the right way to frame it. Because either it's too early to pay for it, I don't have money, or I already have marketing teams or I don't want to pay for the advisory.  So it's, I didn't find this, I'm still calibrating, as you said. Yeah.

23:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was, there's a fit, right? In terms of, of course there's a fit, but in terms of a balance, in terms of if they're really early, all  advice is really valuable because they don't know anything but they have no money and then as they get as they get money they also learn and then the advice needs to be really you know powerful and I was talking to someone not a client I'll probably be a client of this person and he told me that you know coach selling coaching is known to be extremely difficult because it's even if you know the value of talking to someone that knows how to do these things when we're thinking about the decision usually we mention it to like the family buying committee like the wife or the husband and and they'll say what you're paying for somebody to think with you I can think with you and then the buying committee kept the decision so this guy told me was don't try to sell thought partnership try to sell kind of  I think I think that's how we framed it like the transformation which is the advice I'm sure you've seen Yeah, yeah I've seen the guy who's helping coaching Like it's just another name is a yellow picture Okay, okay, but anyway, so so yeah, we are in this kind of space of It's not coaching but it's similar to coaching in a sense like the dynamic is a little bit like like coaching so, okay I think I do And your experience and maybe maybe for this question it will be useful to go back to your agency times Okay So they were not paying for the workshops, right?  There was no buying decision around the workshops or do it

26:00 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  They would, but that would be easy for them to see the value and they would pay like for small tickets back to minus less than 2,000 euros.  And that would be because they saw, okay, because we, when we are working in an agency, you target clients that are already doing the work or they are bigger, better access to it.  So if you can provide just 2,000 is really low for them. And that's we actionable. Like when I just talk about like LinkedIn ads, like a really specific topic, and they know they will get a return from it, because even if they don't work with the agency afterwards, they will have a clear answer to it, like what to optimize a few ideas, et cetera.  So they kind of borrowing the agencies expertise are the kind of good deal. So, yeah, that's, it's not just free with like.

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  of that not a really new job yeah yeah you waste a waste time exploring doing everything custom to make sure it shows all good you all and but then you expect them to close to sign the whatever you say after with like the roadmap or the execution recommendation yeah so thank you for taking that trip to the past and now I'll pull it back to the present in the ideal world so again like I'm learning from you I'm going to sell your workshop so but in an ideal world I assume that you're doing workshops because you know they serve a purpose this is about the workshop if you could do the same thing if you could get the same result without the workshop you'd get it but in your experience what has been the most frustrating or more difficult part about

28:00 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  setting up workshops first I would I would still do it if there was not the best way to do it because it's more fun as well just to mention that I mean it's more fun see that's where I enjoy it I see I people I see it live so I enjoy it otherwise I would do each video and but I don't know I think it's really about the custom access to information from the clients and I'm request the commands just to prepare everything so yeah I don't I don't I don't find them how to do I don't see anything that's struggling with and is that a part of it that the workshop itself is on the bottom the problem is how I use the workshop tell me more please like I don't have any problem doing the workshops because that I never seen fail  And even if it did, I just expanded and just everything was fine again. What I struggled with is how to implement the workshops because I know they are my way to get me to more clients.  But how do I implement this in a way that makes it, that looks like it clicks right away. Like to package my offer to one like front end offer.  think it's Pierre Arabelle who uses this terms. It's a French market hose.

29:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi, great to have you for graphics.

29:27 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Yeah, that is really kind of what he's doing. did a video once on the front end offer. It makes it easy for people to background you because you have only one offer to choose from.  And I think workshops are the best for consultants and maybe agencies as well with the audits. So this is the moral struggle.  I've implemented it in a way that clicks, that works. And to deliver workshop with Linux, it allows me to get someone upset in my own scope.  Okay.

30:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now I'll try to dig deeper. implement is a big word. It's a bit of an iceberg. Like at the top, it feels like once we dig deeper, there's more to it.  Can you perhaps think about a time, a specific time, that you were facing this struggle like how to implement?  Can you tell me more about that? I know we've been touching on it, but can you?

30:23 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Yeah, think we are diving with new workshops. It's more about the author now, more than new workshops. Like we were talking about the author, but this is more about my, as a solo, how do I create my own business?  It's more, it's the different scope, like a workshop or not. It's just my, it's a consulting. So in that category, I think the best way for me to show my value is the workshop.  The thing I'm struggling on is, okay, I should offer the workshop because it's an easy way for me to show my expertise and to buy from it because it's a cheap offer and something I can.  off-package and make it productize because it's not the same but the same more or less every time. So the struggle is more what topics should I choose and how do I market it in a way that people want to buy it all the way.  So and it seems easy for people without me losing my mind over poor customers or poor lead quality or just in the wrong direction.  But that's because I'm a solo so I'm doubting everything I do and I don't know I can do many offers just up to one that's pretty different from agencies.

31:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes yes no I know I know exactly what it mean. Okay this is good. So picking a topic and pricing the workshop like putting the workshop together is not a difficult part yeah that's easy.  Selecting a topic out of the many opportunities that you see is very difficult. Is that it? Yeah.

31:58 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Some people struggle. with some part of the workshop. Like I think it's Vincent Pierry, a guy on LinkedIn who is here, coaching for a workshop, talks.  At this, you have some pressure for the workshop. I'm used to it. I can't provide the expertise. I don't have anything on the execution, really.  Otherwise, I wouldn't offer workshops. so that's why it's more about what's out there.

32:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is a difficult thing to do. Select which thing to turn from into a workshop because there's a lot of work before the workshop.  So there's an investment, right? Yeah. But you have done workshops, so this means that in the past, you have made this decision, even if it's not an easy one, but you have made it.  For instance, that workshop that you've shared on the big startup incubator, what's the name? Yeah, yeah, Station F. Station F, yes, yes.  How did you select? Can you tell me the story of that workshop? How did you select the theme for it?  How did you come up with it? Oh, this workshop was terrible.

33:09 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  It's a free one. gave it for free. It's an incubator, so they have a lot of really young early founders, which is cool, but I just wanted to have an access to station F.  I knew from a permanent relationship with an incubator and they asked me, okay, we have this batch of founders we want to coach and we need someone for this topic.  So I chose the... proposed the timeline and topic and I did the workshop almost live. prepared something that I was...  It's not an incubator, this funder won't help me anyway. So they are really young, most of them won't do anything because they are not really clear in my opinion.  So I just did to get access to station F. All the founders there. It's a bit of... It's not really the best workshop to talk about everything.

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  intro for someone I knew like oh do you know someone there yeah of course and took me a few minutes for sure but I think maybe let me phrase my question in a different way what I like about the story is that the workshops they're about the business objective they're not about the workshop that's not why people want to learn about workshops cool your business objective was to get to get inside of station f right that was the thing you wanted you didn't expect to make money from these guys from the participants and so you offered to make a workshop for them and say hey guys I have these expertise I run workshops can I run a workshop for you guys say sure and you did run the workshop you are not surprised to realize that the participants of the workshop will not buy for me because they're too small too too young they're not the guys but it's not a surprise it's not a failure it is you were expecting this but the workshop did allow you to get inside of station f and  You know what? I am... So in that sense, from my perspective, it was kind of successful for the goal it had.  Is this accurate?

36:11 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I don't know if you put it that way, but I wouldn't... Like, if I didn't do it, that would be okay.  I mean, I didn't really mind it. They asked you, or you asked them? Both ways, kind of. I was like, how can we do some things so I can throw it online then and get some views and then interact with people?  But that's kind of an initiative, I do the same with podcasts. I join a few webinars, I join a few...  I guess the kind of work you do to promote yourself, and I don't see it as a direct revenue update, like I'm not sure it would really increase anything.  But yes, I don't really count it as something that matters to me. Even in this work, yeah, this work, but it's not something I would...  I'm carrying way more about how I can offer workshops easy and product-wise way to sell my stuff, more than promoting myself.  Promoting myself is free. I'm paid for my time, so everyone I can get for free, of course, they will say yes.  It's not about ego, about these guys, they need something from free, so yeah, they will say yes, and they won't give me anything in return about a few of these abilities.

37:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, absolutely, I get your point.

37:37 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  In this guy, didn't understand positioning again, so that's my problem, that's not really a workshop thing, that's my problem.  I still have to explain, clarify with everything, adjust the content, and yeah, didn't start really important to me in this workshop.  I just posted it for the echo, I know what you mean, I know what you mean.

37:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so tell me about the workshop that works really well for you? That you really, you know, had what you wanted from it?

38:07 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Well, met a girl who wanted some advice on one channel, that was like, I think I was content right now, and I worked with a workshop fan, and it's already been, oh, but we also need their business, and then a few things.  So, and then I sold them like four workshops, and I was really hired, one of the high packages I made, that was 20k for four workshops, and in the end, because I just, it was for one client, so I just had to do one analytics of what to do, and I didn't have to pay four, actually, but only one.  This was not that much work to do, but that was fine for me, and that was one of the best I made, but I didn't make one that I currently would like to read you, because this one was worth one, because I wanted just some money out, and it was beyond both marketing.  Now I'm trying to sell expertise, which is quite niche. positioning. I didn't do a workshop that I'm really proud of or I think was successful.  But I think that's more of a topic or a model workshop. That's why the beginning of the topic is the thing that I'm struggling on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I'm going to think a lot. Let's go ahead.

39:26 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  No, I think it's a I'm a weird history because I have a weird job with multiple scopes. I didn't do many services multiple times.  this workshops for the ones that somebody wants time as well. So it's hard to say there is no pattern with I can't tell you a learning pattern.  So I think it's, you know, I don't know English what to say, but just take it lightly. I'm not sure if like I'm not going to run your interview.

40:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  understand what you mean because I think you're very light, also in the stage of our businesses. to give a little bit more context, like I've been talking about this workshop consult for consultants for close to two years, but I have the workshop before, right?  And much of the struggles you've shared with me, and thank you for being open about it, makes the conversation much better.  So much of some of the struggles or challenges you describe, it was exactly like my daily life. doing something that it's valuable, but people don't get it, they only get it if they see it, but to make them see it, you need to price it in a way that they'll just, yeah, take it, but then they get, they see it and they get the value out of it and they don't want the next thing.  That's very, very familiar. I mean, if we were closer together, we would get a coffee for sure. Enough said, but you follow it.  Yeah. And, but so my point is, I think there's a lot of people in this position. And this is why it's interesting for me to explore with you like, let's say the messy needle like, I've done a workshop, I've learned workshops by doing them, you know, I mean, a lot of people I think are like that.  And what I want to avoid with the book is to come up with some  theory about just the four steps to workshops, you know, without first understanding, that's like the common experience for people, because most people I talk about this, they've learned workshops the same way you have, you have workshops, they were working at the company where there were workshops, they saw it.  They have the right social skills. Because some people they see the workshops, but they don't have the right personality for it.  And they don't adopt the tool. But you have funny workshops. So this tells me that you like this, you know, taking with people creating just enough structure, and so on.  So it's really valuable for me to know, like that, first, I'm not alone. That's that's useful. And to know, like, how you think about these things, right?  like, especially, I want to, I mean, I'll stop apologizing, but I'll start thanking you a lot, which is the other side of this coin.  when you shared, like, the distinction between agencies can lose money on workshops, but souls cannot, which is kind of, yes, of course.  But I didn't have it so clear. So this is really valuable for me as well. You're going on the book.  So, yeah, I mean.

42:37 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I think your business is close to, if you target solos and consultants, you're close to Ryan Muselman. I was looking for his name, and I found it again.  Can you paste it on?

42:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm going to paste it in chat.

42:50 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  He's doing, he's helping, like, coaches to create the package and the funnel. And they usually, OK. Hmm Crafty we offer and you use would be craft to push up that you can sell easily to show you there would be like an off your angle Or maybe more like Yeah, Nick Nick, I think I've seen yes, but this guy this Ryan I have not seen Yeah, well this you get I think we want You are like them a kind of the same angle if you're writing solos but this guy they sell uh The volumes like multiple lines at the same time or uh not that premium like a sugar a day Coaching But I think max trailer would be the world for the agencies Yeah, yeah, that's all about who you target and I think the workshops we workshops are really interesting that depends what you're targeting if this is really doing the workshop or outside of the workshop Really different topics for everyone of us so Pretty interesting.

43:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you go about it. So, yeah

44:00 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I like your content and I think it's pretty clear. I'm not sure I would need it because for me, it's really about how to sell it more than the workshop itself.  you see, that's. Everything is related, right?

44:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, they are not the same thing, but they are connected for sure. They are connected as well.

44:21 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  I'm trying to show you, but it's nothing that's pretty interesting what you are doing. That's why we're the right direction.  I'm not going to see. Thank you for saying that.

44:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, This is great. This is really good. Thank you. I've made notes and I'll ask Fathom and I'll do all those things.  Can I keep you posted on what happens and so on?

44:47 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Sure. Okay.

44:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll do that. And I'll take a look at your, I remember you were saying that you're putting the website up maybe two weeks ago, but I didn't check it.  Is it up now? The new offer?

45:02 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Just like two days ago, yes, we... No one saw it yet. Like I can say that to you.

45:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm pretty impressed.

45:16 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Perfect.

45:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm trying.

45:18 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Just a little bit like on the... On the web at night. Like, okay, stop. Because I didn't... I replicated your main program myself.  Like the... The 10K offer for other consulting program. There's like six weeks thing. But there's too much commitment. So like, okay, I need to set up a workshop or a medium offer in between.  And I thought about this workshop that I openly kind of did a few times. But I thought it would be the easiest way to sell from LinkedIn, actually.  Enough from one to one of the intros. But only for the LinkedIn part. So I put this on my profile like two days ago and I need to redo everything.  Too much. I like it.

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I will take a closer look, I like that you mentioned you cannot read the label from inside the bottle.  It's a picture that recently came to my awareness, it's very useful, I use it a lot now.

46:15 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  It's pretty easy, when you touch the beauty, I don't make illustration as pretty as yours, but touch the beauty.

46:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is such a beauty, it's really good.

46:25 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  For example, the AIS, on this style, on this. It's really crisp.

46:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. I have to go now, and also I think you have to go now, but thank you, this was really good.  I really appreciate how much you shared with me, and I'm glad we got to talk. I'm glad I got to see you and hear you.

46:46 - Gaspard Pastural (gaspardpastural.com)
  Same, I'm glad I got to talk, I hope I will do something, I don't know. If you have any further questions, just shoot in the email or you can take a look online.  And yeah, best of luck. hope to see you soon.

46:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you, thank you.
