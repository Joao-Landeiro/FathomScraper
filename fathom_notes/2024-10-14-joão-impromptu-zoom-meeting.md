0:00 - Nate Jebb
  My friend, hold on. Where are you? Where I can see him. Hey, what's going on?

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good to see you. Good to see you. I'm sorry. Still fighting a few tabs and windows and.

0:14 - Nate Jebb
  Oh, that's okay.

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to see. Okay. Now I see. How are you doing?

0:27 - Nate Jebb
  I'm doing great. I am. I was really excited just to hear how it went.

0:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And even by the way, if nothing has happened since we talked, that's fine.

0:40 - Nate Jebb
  Good things have happened. That's fine. I just like talking to you. So that's what's up with me.

0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's so funny.

0:49 - Nate Jebb
  Can you hear me? Yeah.

0:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. No, because I have this microphone. I bought this external microphone and I was talking to you and I'm looking at it's off light.  So is apparently off, but you can hear me. So it's a bit confusing. Anyway, I can believe with that.  Yeah, I got a set I didn't call my friends. Yes, that feels embarrassed. Oh, that's how it goes.

1:14 - Nate Jebb
  Expect that there will be more week times like that.

1:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you're fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This has been a, I mean, just to give a little bit of context, I know you don't demand an explanation.  I think it's just interesting. bit of kind of busy weeks. And I think today I will use the second.  It will be my second time using what it told me about persuasive question asking and persuasive selling for me.  So if this lands a sale, it's going to be again two for two, which 100% hit rate, it's pretty amazing.  So that's, thank you, thank you for that.

2:02 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah. Yeah, it's any framework that makes the majority of what I need to get done simple. I really appreciate that.  And just, it's such a great framework. It's like, have them tell you what's important. Think about if your products can solve that important issue.  And then to simply explain to them how they could and ask, do they want to do that? Like that really cuts through a lot of sales BS that I've heard.

2:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you know, one of the things, actually I have some, some questions for you about perhaps some more nuanced application of this.  But I found that to be, to be, to make sense. And so I have to.

3:00 - Nate Jebb
  questions.

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me just write them down so I don't lose them. So the first question is related to using this more contextual, maybe, kind of approach.  When what I sell is more more, you know, packets, productize, know, like either it works or it doesn't. So let me put some meat on this explanation.  The first time I've used this, it was for a thing I've never done, but I mean, I never done like as a package, but then I put together like a document that says, we're going to do this much sessions, this will be the outcome of the sessions and so on and so plan here.  mean, I'm not just, you know, blindingly hiring as well, right? And I think that that was useful. And the second application of this will be today, and I think it's for a different thing from that, right?  So I cannot use the same process because this is a slightly different thing. The first one was a guy that wanted to create his first consulting product.  And the second one is a guy that already has kind of a product. Anyone has to use workshops and that kind of stuff to elevate what he does.  So it's not the same thing. At the stage I am right now, this is not difficult to manage. just, know, I reframe these things a little bit, but I was wondering like, okay, so when I have like a portfolio of like three, four offers, like there's these things, it could be the case I imagine that what people tell me does not fit with any of those offers, but it would fit with me, not just those offers, right?

4:57 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

4:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, it's so good to just.

5:00 - Nate Jebb
  Let's hear yourself talk up like, yeah, but an obvious way of solving this. Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think you in the end time with you is the product.  Now, you may have to explain to them that in a certain outcome is the product, but the thing that's going to solve it is time with you, work that you're going to do after the fact.  So I think as long as you can figure out what their issue is and find a clean way to explain how you're going to spend throughout this time making the outcome they want happen, then that's your that's your product and then you have to do the persuasive selling format to explain how that product works.

5:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

5:58 - Nate Jebb
  Did I see your name at July?

6:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You said it as well as you might be able to, because it's a very nasal sound, you are...

6:08 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I don't think I've ever had anyone non-native speaker really hit it, even like French people, which they are good with the nasals.

6:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, Joao is good, it's very good.

6:20 - Nate Jebb
  Okay, thank you. No problem. I actually would like your help on something. Great, if that's okay with you.

6:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very okay.

6:33 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I'm excited for that. I'm just going to talk, because I know you can't. But I have a lot of work to do.  Like, basically, I can tell there's a lot of dis... tends to travel for me with what I'm doing at work right now and it can be difficult because people on my team may want to know what are you working on or how far along are you and I can't always give an explanation but I need to be able to and I think I would even feel good from the clarity just knowing like yeah I made progress today I know what I did and I have mild stones and I know I'm either a little behind or a little ahead I don't feel guilty about either one but I would like to know generally where I stand and here's what I'm working on we've been able to get a fair amount of people to sign up for our software but they don't stay and they don't stay for good reason it's because they they haven't put  Any information into our software, it's called Playbook Builder, you know, if you don't have any playbooks You should stop paying And I I've worked with people one-on-one and just tried to help them build playbooks and those people have stayed So that's good But I can't just do one-on-one calls with everyone Well, actually, here's the tricky thing At this point, I might be able to do one-on-one calls with everyone But I can't Tell everyone on my team or even tell myself that that's my long-term strategy It can't just be my time so The way that we have the solution I've proposed Is that instead of it be basically Nate Does it with you one-on-one?  We have two options Nate does it with you as a group, so it's you and other people. not one-to-one, it's one-to-many.  And then also there's a do-it-yourself playbook because if we are a company that makes playbooks, shouldn't we be able to make one?  That trains you how to make them. know, it's weirdly hilariously self-referential, but but we should be able to. And so I'm working on that right now.  And then the do-it-with-you-want-to-many thing is I'm trying to do a community kind of like Dave Gray has done. And the community, the basic idea of it is I've got a lot of energy for this stuff, and I think energy is the foundational element.  It's not information. It doesn't. And I think I can like I think bumping into me and spending time with me.  You like to make progress, because it's like, yeah, I've got a plan, you know, it's exciting. And I want to do that in two forums.  I'm calling them orientations and working sessions. In the orientations, there's two kinds. There's the 101 course and the 201 course.  101 is anyone that your company can come to an orientation where I just run them through. What's Playbook Builder?  Why do you use it? How does it work? It's almost like a what to expect when your company's launching Playbook Builder.  And then the 201 orientation is actually kind of a hands-on training about the self-serve Playbook. So I'm going to say like, listen, I've made a Playbook.  You can do this yourself. But I know you're going to have questions that are specific to you in your situation.  So let's walk through the Playbook. get a high level and then ask me your questions and I'll try to give you an on-ramp to that playbook.  So in the end, I do want you doing the work, but I'll teach you how to work. If you've gone through that session, then you are welcome to come to the working sessions.  You can't come to the working sessions unless you have been trained on how to build your own playbooks. Because all the working sessions are just kind of quiet, music's playing, and we all are working on our own playbooks.  So I'm trying to give a multi-faceted approach for people at different skill levels to build their own playbooks. So that's one of the things, and then I have a couple of other things I want to say, but let me stop for a moment.  Does anything in perity, as I say, all of that?

12:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think there's perhaps three things.

12:06 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first one, I think it's just the beach head into the topic, which is like getting visibility on how you're moving along as part of you as a team.  Not so much related to the product, but when people ask you how far along you are. So I think there's that world, but I think that was just a way of getting into this other thing, right?  And this other thing makes me think that is a bit of activation and churn issue. That's what it And then  based on that so this is kind of a pyramid we're going up and then we have like product features or like the how specific how you the hypothesis about how to solve this right and how clear is it for you and the company the reason why people like how much granularity do you have on why people are not staying like yeah i'll just leave the question here i think i'm pretty clear what is it what do you think is is the i don't think people want to do this work it's like exercise they want the results they want to be fit we're in the business

14:00 - Nate Jebb
  context. They want their company to be clear on what they're doing to have less chaos. want all of that.  But it takes work to achieve it and they don't want to do the work.

14:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They don't want to exercise so to speak. Okay, so just to humor me. This is something people told you or this is like a strong assumption.

14:28 - Nate Jebb
  Many, many people have told me we are no longer using your tool because we don't have time to work on it.

14:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Do you have any idea on if there are other so my assumption I'll just the director's cut explain how I'm thinking.  So what I'm thinking is

15:01 - Nate Jebb
  they they say that they don't have the time is it's common but then we figure out that people are spending time on other initiatives right that are probably more immediate right do you know what other things are they doing instead of doing the playbook it's different by industry but we're working with small the mid-size business owners and I think for most of them believe that things in their business won't be done well if they don't do it and so I think there were I'll give you example a guy owned a furniture dealership so that means people come into his office they say I want a new dining room table and chairs please can I buy it they buy it let's say it shipped away to them they're very upset they call and they complain and then this guy who the owner gets on the phone with them and calms them down and finds  way that they want to keep working with them. They're doing stuff like that. They're just responding to what's going on in their email inbox or their client calls.

16:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're just putting out fires. And I'll make I might make some questions that I might might ask some questions that are obvious but since I have no context I'll just go ahead.  Do you when you guys a cell playbook builder do you have this notion of what would be the biggest leverages for them in terms of like what tree processes they need to focus on to start getting value?

16:44 - Nate Jebb
  I think in theory it's onboarding, capturing your retiring employees knowledge before they leave. Selling the business or preparing to sell the business.  and getting your teams to have their hand off speed cleaner like they gather and hand off the right information.  Those are the ideas, but I don't see people do it that well anyway.

17:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just thinking out loud, the way I think about this for things, so on onboarding preparing to sell and offs and there was something else documenting what retiring employee before they retire.  The way I the way this comes across to me is that this is more focused except for the retiring thing.  more focused on what it does and less so on what problems it solves, right? So onboarding. On what income, to me, it makes me think, oh, this is about getting people up to speed faster or up to the same level of quality or stuff like that.  Prepare to sell. Yeah, prepare to sell is also little bit like the retiring employee sort of thing, outcome, kind of outcome focused.  And the end of, to me, hands-off comes across as super important, crucial in every industry, but a little bit like the fish doesn't know it's wet.  So people are like, yeah, sure, hand-offs. But I don't know, I'm just a speculator on top of a little bit of information.  So let me see if I can call less my thinking into this.

18:53 - Nate Jebb
  Wait, can I say that back?

18:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you just said? Because I think you said some good stuff.

18:57 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah. All I told you were out comes. I didn't tell you what problems specifically need to be solved to get to those outcomes.  So it's like what I just told you. mean, who doesn't want to get a higher multiple when they sell their business?  I can help you get a higher multiple. Okay, but what actually are we talking about? is the work you're going to do?  And I think when it gets down to that, I don't know.

19:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What work they need they need to do?

19:40 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, because you can I've only been able to certain it case by case. mean, for example, I worked with a property manager and she did everything for this guy.  He owned 90 rental business. And when I interviewed her, I think, a lot of the value was I realized that she was using her personal network to get things done.  And so I said, who do we use to mow the lawns? And she said, well, I have a friend, okay, that's not helpful.  What is his name? His name is Marco, okay, what is Marco's phone number? It's this. How do we pay Marco?  pay him with Zell or Cash, okay? Is Marco available to work for us any time or does he have a backlog?  No, anytime. How quickly can he begin working on a project for us, usually within 24 hours?

20:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the stuff that really helped.

20:45 - Nate Jebb
  But I don't know how to make up a principle about that, it's just you got to get your hands dirty.  That's why I'm having trouble coaching people in general how to do it, because you got to

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Use your brain and see you what would help me get the job done There's a I don't know if this this fits, but I found it to be useful sometimes There's this idea from a computer programming.  They call it rubber duck debugging.

21:19 - Nate Jebb
  Have you heard this?-hmm.

21:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay No, it's but I don't get how you're applying it though And I knew it as you have to say it to the doc like all right here's what I'm gonna do here, you know, yeah, yeah, so What I imagine that is And if I stray off topic, please bring me back but if what I imagine that you would just describe to this property manager is the difficulty of making them realize Or is it a difficulty of teaching other people how to explore the implicit knowledge of others?  So, you have a lot of repetitions on this, a lot of flight hours on this, and you probably have the sense of when somebody says something and you're like, there's something else here that we need to, you know, get to the bottom up, right?  Yes. This is probably second nature to you. But to lot of people, this isn't. And the challenge is, how can we help others that do not have this lens, this perspective, get sufficiently competent at understanding how other people work, right?  And I think this idea of the debugging is, it does, it's an ergonomic idea. think people can kind of understand it.  And can say what the idea is, Robert, our debugging, can you teach it to me? Sure. So, let's say you are doing something complex like code, and at some point it stops working, and you're like, I don't understand why it stops working, which is a very common  I think it's tough to write you, but you just don't understand. And you kind of feel like you should be working.  There's something wrong with somewhere else. Oftentimes, you don't want to go through the trouble of checking every single line until you find the missing column or whatever.  So you get a rubber duck and you put it on your desk. And you explain what each line of code does.  You talk about the line of code in terms of what's the purpose of that line of code. And you explain what it does and how it works.  And as you go through this, it happens the same thing that happened to me at the beginning of this call.  I was asking you, how do I deal with the fact that? And then I heard myself saying this. was like, OK, yeah, I know the answer, right?

23:46 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

23:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think it's an approach that equips people that are not experts at process mapping. It gives them isos.  pose a step function in terms of increasing their ability. Like, they don't know where to start mapping processes from others.  And you just give them this, and they went from 0 to 1. Like, OK, maybe it won't be the best thing, but it's good.  OK, now I get it. And OK, so that's the thing about rubber debugging.

24:27 - Nate Jebb
  Then you were also making the point that there's a difficulty in teaching people how to explore the implicit knowledge of others, and that it's second nature to me, because I've just done that.  Yeah. How do I teach someone? And you said, rubber debugging feels like a good step. And then I cut you off and said, explain rubber debugging.

24:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  felt like you had more you were going to set up. Yeah, so rubber duct there. RDD, RDD, otherwise I'll just tie my tongue into a knot.  So RDD, it feels like. the first good first step and it's also very self-referential. So if you if you do it yourself about how you map other people's processes, it will become explicit to yourself the kind of questions you ask, right?  Yeah, because I think a lot of what we do is related to the certain like tried-in-true questions that we don't even notice that we're doing.

25:25 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah. Yeah.

25:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this is why sometimes I say, oh, I'm now in Director's Cut mode where I think out loud so people can understand where the question the question comes from.  Actually, this could be also a useful tool to state.

25:40 - Nate Jebb
  What is it again, direct your mode.

25:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you remember when you watched the DVD that the Director's got? Yeah. On this scene, I wanted them to feel afraid.  So I changed thinking. But instead of making it sound that you're just Thinking with that with no filter you frame that in the context of I will speak out loud the way I'm thinking So you understand where where I'm coming from?

26:09 - Nate Jebb
  Well, maybe what I could do is this is I mean the problem with all this is you're talking about how you work And so it all becomes so self-referential that you are triple yourself.  Yeah, but But I have these calls Recordings of me doing this work. It might make sense to do a director's cut of those Where I'm recording myself Showing that call and causing it and saying at this moment.  This is why I did this.

26:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is why I did that That would be a pretty simple way to teach it Yes, I think that's very cool and Something that you can do this afternoon with that is do you have the transcripts of those calls?  Yeah You can I've tried It is like this weekend, and it was good enough.

27:02 - Nate Jebb
  And I can share my screen with you.

27:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I uploaded that on that Google Notebook LM. And this can be opaque to them, right?

27:10 - Nate Jebb
  can do it on yourself.

27:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So they don't see you doing this. Because you would like to share your screen. Yeah. me share my screen.
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ZDixtGBv2P-bZPjgxMwGxpGi15zayHL4?timestamp=1644.383417
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ZDixtGBv2P-bZPjgxMwGxpGi15zayHL4?timestamp=1644.383417  Google Chrome. Share. OK. OK. OK. really don't like this Oobar. OK. Where is it? I'm a little bit boss.  This is the first I've been using it for OK. Can you see my screen?

27:50 - Nate Jebb
  Just your email. Just what? I just see your email. Oh, it's just the emails you and I have sent each other.  That's all. I see.

28:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I want to share this thing, share. Now you see something else?

28:13 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, yeah.

28:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  both of them. Yeah. OK, so I what I did was I got all my emails I've written. I exported them as a PDF.  I uploaded them here and then I asked them, what can you say about my method? About my thinking, can you extract the framework for my thinking?  So if you have these recordings, maybe you can do the same.

28:35 - Nate Jebb
  Is notebook LMS the one to use?

28:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I I don't know. I've heard because it's free and even the free version allows you to upload stuff, right?  And that's why I why when you use chat GPT. But I don't pay for chat GPT.

28:53 - Nate Jebb
  I think if you pay, you could do it. Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah.

28:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, but I'd like to find the. The questions I've asked, it's probably thinking right now. It's a little bit slow.  Okay, I'll try again. from this email, emails, extract what are two principles if we want a thinking. Yeah, I guess it didn't save the history of the thing.  But it was very interesting when I got it, because it didn't get it perfectly, I think, but it was useful enough for me to like, okay, okay, I kind of know how I work now, you know.  So this could be useful in terms of view, understanding of replies and Portuguese.

29:52 - Nate Jebb
  But it says, show instead of saying. Yeah, so.

30:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Legibility is more important than precision, workshops are important, understand clients' needs, focus on results and value, so this stuff is a little bit generic, right?  Yeah, address emotional blocks and stuff like that. But anyway, it was relatively fast. So, I think that maybe this conversation is right now, I'm taking it all over the place.

30:35 - Nate Jebb
  So, it's fine to me, I have no problem with that.

30:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my thinking behind this is this. The assumption that the problem is to be solved with a community is a very impactful one.  because that's an expensive way of solving a problem in terms of time, dedication, and if we could find other ways of addressing the problem with less effort, maybe it prevents you from going into this deep thing that will need its own flywheels and its own acceleration before it starts yielding results, right?

31:25 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

31:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So from a very tactical perspective, and maybe I've done this, I would check out what's the common thinking around increasing activation and reducing churn, because there's stuff there that it's like low hanging fruit.  So just using an example, I don't know if it is an accurate example to your situation. be like, oh, so and so I've noticed that you've been using this for a week, but you haven't yet done anything with it.  Can I help you with something? This would be like a relatively basic thing that probably you guys do. You know, all the other things are like reducing that time to value moment, a moment.  So perhaps just that in a short list of whenever we work with people like the people like you, we've noticed that they get the most value when they capture this specific process, right?  Yeah, it's probably also something you guys do. So basically, I think this is a checklist kind of thinking that could just make sure that you are not concentrating on the eye effort, eye uncertainty thing, the

34:10 - Nate Jebb
  I'm just processing what you're saying. Give me one moment. just want to think about I've heard what you said and I found a lot of value in it.  I'd like to say a totally tangential or maybe even unrelated thing and get your thoughts on it.

34:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's still related to my work, but that's true.

34:42 - Nate Jebb
  I don't know if this can be taught or needs to be. I found the people who use their accounts.  They don't actually have any questions. it all. They just get in there and they do it.

35:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem. Just like I would.

35:04 - Nate Jebb
  No problem. The people who just can't figure it out, it's a lost cost. I shouldn't even focus on them.  So I feel like the solution to the problem is picking a different market to target for sales, not trying to help people who really can't be helped.  Without an immense amount of work. So what's your thought on that?

35:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes a lot of sense to me. It makes me think that a lot of it can be addressed, I don't know if it solves, but with a qualifying, these guys?

35:49 - Nate Jebb
  Because one thing I've noticed and I don't have a ton of data on this is why I have a ton of data on where we get our leads.  They're almost all out of this EOS. community and this community says you need to do process but the way they teach it is very big and confusing so that when we get clients from that community yeah EOS um they are entrepreneurial operating system they actually go ahead please they're confused and they're really hard to work with when i've gotten leads from google they have no problems with their software they get it right away and they like it now that to me would say i need to change where i'm getting leads from because i'm spending so much time i'm really spending all of my time on the leads from this EOS community and in the long run they're not paying on

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  off.

37:01 - Nate Jebb
  Because, you know, in the past 12 months, I worked with 272 companies from this community. Only 60 of them have stayed as paying clients.  And I've had many, many, many calls with each company between two and 10 calls. And only 60 have stayed.  I'm already seeing some of those are churning. So to me, I feel like I'm targeting the wrong type of person.

37:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That, that could be the case. Could you demonstrate that, could you demonstrate that, that, that hypothesis to the rest of your team?

37:49 - Nate Jebb
  I could demonstrate that varidist group and remodel health found us over Google and immediately jumped in and made it happen.  I could demonstrate that, I'm just thinking a lot of night watch, when they were trying to do it the EOS way, took a bunch of time.  And when they said to this gal and their team Jessica, just go ahead and do what makes sense to you.  She got it done right away. So I actually think EOS has been a block for us because they are teaching people a framework that makes it difficult to work with our tool.

38:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. That's a very interesting idea. Yeah, I really like that idea of that concept that I don't know if we ever spoke about this, but sometimes I watch like gun videos on YouTube.  I don't don't gun or anything. I don't think it's good anyway, but that kind of stuff. I hear people saying that it's much easier to teach women how to shoot well because they have their less vices.  They have not been contaminated by movies and video games, holding it in sideways and stuff like that. So they're going from the ground up.  And, apparently, it's easier to teach people if they don't come into you with misconceptions.

39:09 - Nate Jebb
  That's true. Learn from the ground up. People who learn from the ground up with me, they don't have a problem and I don't have to teach them that much.

39:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, and I think this is a, I would assume this is a relatively common challenge because everything is being frameworked, right?  And even if on the surface things are different, but deep down, there's the same frameworks. People coming to you with different words, different jargon, different concepts.  There's always like this translation. Oh, it's like EOS, but a little bit different, you know, they have to make this translation in real time.  So, to me, it makes sense that that conclusion you've arrived. You've arrived that maybe EOS is kind of distraction even perhaps because it could feel very enticing but I think there's maybe a halfway measure we could do here I don't usually like halfway measures but maybe there's something here related to the way you guys qualify how these people start working with you and maybe you could just you know select people for that are more ready but because you got 60 guys from EOS it would not be a problem if you didn't spend so much time on the other guys right I mean oh no no yeah right well wait wait I don't know if I knew what you meant say it again my assumption is that EOS brings a lot of leads but these leads are not of the same quality some of them you know you get some traction on them  and some after lot of work, and others you put in a lot of work and still they don't really, know, stay, right?  So, yes, they don't arrive at you ready. They arrive at you and they still need a little bit of, you know, finishing touches to be ready.  And these finishing touches require lot of investment on your side in terms of time, attention, stuff like that. Well, if these are...

41:31 - Nate Jebb
  Can you see my screen?

41:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you stop me? Yeah.

41:38 - Nate Jebb
  Okay.

41:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, now I see your screen.

41:41 - Nate Jebb
  What I'm sorry, I cut you off really.

41:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's good.

41:46 - Nate Jebb
  I have a hunch that you're right. So, I had a survey I was just working on to try to figure out why someone's doing it in the first place.  And this question is pretty important, but then I also realized in the problem is this quiz, this survey is way, way too long, but how long is it?  Well I can cut it down, but I think it's like 27 questions, like it's just really long.

42:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't think that's necessarily too long, okay? Okay. I've heard people with 40, 50 questions.

42:29 - Nate Jebb
  But like, there are things that they need to, there are beliefs that they have that will make the work easier difficult for them, like, do they believe that every single skill is transferable?  If they say yes, that's actually a problem, not every skill. If you can do it, you can teach it.

42:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's not true.

42:50 - Nate Jebb
  Yes, they, they, could avoid our training headaches if we recruited more thoughtfully, like, are you training poorly or are you getting people who aren't suited  to the work, you know, and all of these things, it takes five to 10 years to become skilled, like certain people want their salespeople to be effective in the first three months.  What if it took three years for them to be useful? Now maybe it doesn't, I don't know, but I've found all of these things the word process only is one meaning.  That's not true. It means so many different things to different people. So I'm just trying to get a gauge on what they believe.  It means handoffs, like I'm going to just skim through a few more, but process refers to how. I believe data and rigorous analysis are prerequisites for good business decisions.  These people tend to be bad at doing process because they're really, they have everything prepared so they get nervous and they're perfectionistic.  This person's better at process. I expect to have to make business decisions amidst uncertainty most of the time. They will just get started and figure it out.  You know, my employees need to be told what to do. If that's what you believe about your employees, you're probably going to make a training that's like overly simplified and not useful and kind of annoying.  Did you see how I'm? These are all things that butt up against the issue. And if you believe the right things, you have no problems with this work.  And if you don't believe the right things, it's like it. You can't understand why it's not working.

44:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

44:44 - Nate Jebb
  Does this what I don't actually know what it is that I'm showing you, I like made this compulsively and wasn't sure what it was.  What do you what's coming when I show this to you? Because I don't really fully get it. just know it's relevant.

45:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I think this makes a lot of sense, I don't think it's too long. I think this is in a way you transfer into form that sort of implicit expertise you have about mapping others and so it's like what matters the most, which is good.  I think this is the right way to go and then there's like, there's people that are really really good at this and they find ways of phrasing the questions in a way that people don't know what they're supposed to answer, because sometimes people know what they're supposed to answer, they give you false answers, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Research scorecard marketing approach (ref. Daniel Priestley) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ZDixtGBv2P-bZPjgxMwGxpGi15zayHL4?timestamp=2745.9999  And there's a whole science around form design, let's say, which I'm not too experienced with. But I think the idea behind this is really good.  Have you heard of Skork? So there's this guy, I think you would appreciate this because he has a book on this and I think it makes sense.  So the name is Daniel, Daniel Priestley. I'll just, I'll find the, what do you prefer is page, YouTube video, YouTube video, yeah.  Okay, so I haven't watched this specific video. I've watched other videos from this guy. I'll just send you the video over chat.  And I mean, from here, I think you can find a way into things. Basically, what the guy does is this thing you're doing, it creates a form, it does two things with the form.  The first one is to collect information, which is the thing you're doing. But the other thing, which is also very clever, is that he uses the form a little bit as a personality assessment.  So people have a motivation incentive to fill in the form, right? I'm going to give you an example. Let's say you create a form that says, check out, already, are you to sell your company.

47:37 - Nate Jebb
  Okay?

47:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you ask these questions, and people will want to fill in the form. Even if they do not become clients, you get a certain sense of the market, of how people think about these things.  some of them might be like, oh, this guy really gets me, I want to work with him. What this Daniel guy does also is he has some sort of automation.  edit scoring thing that gives you a score like a oroscope or a scope and at the end you get like a PDF that says where do you stand on that score I've done this for myself and I can show you the results he sent me yeah let me share my screen entire screen share okay I think you see my entire screen right okay so this was the report the thing gave me okay see yeah okay and this was his company at the time and this is the his framework and basically everything is red well anyway that doesn't matter that's bad the point was I answered like 50 questions I don't remember all of them and then he shows  me where do I stand and this is very smart because then I can see the path forward like oh I'm still at this stage but I can see the next stage is this thing okay and yes it is on software to do this thing so this is I think a relatively easy thing to prototype and for instance the only thing I had going going well for me was that I had some methodology okay and then it starts to explain this report is generated automatically with you know automations anyway doesn't matter but the point is there's three elements here first they ask me a lot of questions right and I answer these questions because I was incentivized to because I wanted to know what can I do to improve my business I didn't I didn't feel I was filling in an intake form I felt I was getting like a pre free consulting sort of thing because I give it this stuff it gave me an assessment this is free this is useful for me okay  So that was relevant. He got more information about this kind of market he serves. So he probably uses that with just his communication, his arguments, all this sort of stuff.  And the next thing is, I think he works with kind of a waiting list. And what he does now is that whenever there's openings for his consulting work, he just calls the people that are the most ready.  And in this way, he increases his probability of getting like a good case study out of it. Because he will not spend so much time with people that are not ready.

50:39 - Nate Jebb
  That's right. So really smart.

50:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I was the first time, because this guy is one of those like really good at selling stuff online.  And I was like, can I trust this guy? Is it just good at talking about this stuff? But I think the principles are solid.  And I've heard a lot of people doing the same sort of thing. I've known friends that have like improvised, because he has his own software, right?  Yeah, right now he has a software for this stuff. But I have friends that do this like with growth marketing and stuff like that.  There's a book. And where's the book? Yeah, maybe there's, what? What is oversubscribed that's the book? I think that's the book.

51:37 - Nate Jebb
  Wow. No, this makes a lot of sense. mean, I believe that there's room for high paid consulting from us.  People want to. I've found that this for 25 years, know, I mean, people want to work with us, even if as a lead source, we went, Hey, we might grow more slowly.  But let's reselect the people who want to work with us and give them a little help charge for it.  And our monthly recurring revenue won't increase as quickly, but we'll have a lot of cash on hand. That's not a bad.

52:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, not.

52:31 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I mean, you're really giving me good stuff, man.

52:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'm glad to hear that.

  Um, let's, let's change the topic just for a second, because let's put it this way. Do you think that you could get a post it?  No. Ow. Not right now, you don't have to do it right now.

53:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, good.

53:04 - Nate Jebb
  And write the phone number of just one of the people that you would like to call. You don't have to call them.  Ever. But you could write their phone number out and put it on your computer. And then. And. What is something that you like to eat?  Like a good thing to eat like it tastes good, not healthy. Chocolate. Do you have any chocolate in the house?

53:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

53:43 - Nate Jebb
  I would suggest you go get the chocolate, sit it next to the post it. And you can have it anytime you want as long as you make that call.

53:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you can even make the call and hang up right away. That's allowed to.

53:59 - Nate Jebb
  Okay. So there's like no risk. I'm just, you know, you could set yourself up here to make one call.  That's my only encouragement to you. I know you'll do it in the long run that you have it in you.  You're very skilled and you care about your business. But it's 50 percent of the work is making the first call.  And so I would encourage you to make the structure around you really easy to do that. That's my only thought.  All right. But you do you should get the chocolate out for real and be in serious movement.

54:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now that's that's easy because I mean I have circles right here. Everything I need.

54:40 - Nate Jebb
  Everything I need. Everything you need. And then what should we do? What should we do next? Because I do think you could fill yourself up with business.  I know you've had lot going on. There's no guilt or any shame or anything. what do you want to do next?  we want to put it on a hold for a month? I'd be happy to or do you want to try to make a call some time in the next week or two?  No shame either way.

Okay, so let's pretend you did make the call.  right, you know That what you were gonna do on the call is say Hey My friend, I've got an idea.  Can you help me? You were gonna say something like that. They say, oh sure. I'll help you And then you were gonna say There's something i'm trying to do at work.  Would you be willing to spend 20 minutes with me and give me feedback on it on a zoom call?  That's it. That's all you were gonna say. So I'm making you do this now pretend you're calling me Okay, so pick up pick up your phone My phone is not here, but i'll pick it on your hand your hand phone your hand phone So call me.

57:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, ring ring Hello, hi So, I Pedro, how are you?

58:02 - Nate Jebb
  time to see. Wow, man. Wow, great to hear from you. no, it's been a while.

58:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's going on? So much. Actually, I apologize. So Pedro, I'm working on something. I'm developing something, a new, a new product, service product.  And I think it's been the right person to give me a little bit of feedback on it. Because you know me, you've seen the way I work, and I'd like to show you, show it to you and get your input on it.  Would you be OK for a 15 minute call, one of these days?

58:41 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I'd love to.

58:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we? Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. mean, that was quick. Can we schedule it now? Do you have like two minutes now?  So we find a time and date and just put it on the calendar. Would that be okay with you?

59:01 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, sure. Yeah, one, you want to meet?

59:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what do you think about two o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday, 15 minutes?

59:18 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I can do it.

59:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so yeah, thank you, thank you. I'll just put it in my agenda. There's no pre-work, don't need to worry about anything, I'll just call you.  And I'll tell a little bit more about this thing I'm building. And I'll see, I'll get your feedback on it, which is really valuable.  And this is not a sales call, it's just, you know, you know me, you know, I work and I think it's valuable for me to show you stuff before it's ready.  If you have a good eye for that.

59:52 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, sounds like a plan, I look forward to it.

59:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, thank you, thank you so much. And I'll see you all on Wednesday then.

1:00:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thanks.

1:00:05 - Nate Jebb
  Good job Okay, so here's what you did well, okay It always feels awkward to do something bad. Yeah, here's what you did well.  You asked directly for a time Mm-hmm, I have other notes too, but I'm just gonna give you that one note for now Thank you Yeah, and then here's one thing that should change I Think it might make sense to send a text before you call mm-hmm and say Hey, I know it's been a while since we've spoken Okay, you be willing to help me with something.  I'll give you a call and explain a bit more detail because One thing I felt while we got on the call was, oh, wow, we've known each other for a while, but we haven't talked in a while.  felt kind of like, wait, you're finally calling me now, but you're asking for something, know, like a little bit, but you can't call them and then catch up and then like flip it to an  because although you were just doing that, so I think if you texted, hey, no one's been a long time since we've spoken, can you help me with something?  I can call you an explain it in more detail. That would probably be a good start because then when you call and say, hey, I really want to catch up with you, but I've got this specific thing I think you can help me with.  I basically just need to have a call with you where you could give me feedback on something. Are you open to that?  they'd say like, yeah, I mean feedback on what? And you would basically say, I have consulting work I'm doing, but before I start asking people.  To work with me. I've got a practice and I know that you know, I trust you So can I practice with you and I'll say to you my pitch and then you explain to me?  What you like and what you didn't like and and there's not you're not gonna get any business out of that but that's gonna start getting you to not Have any hesitance What are your thoughts on that?

1:02:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think it was a very elegant way of dealing with that of that just call out of the blue and just ask for a time and the person's like It's a bit of a drive-by sort of thing, right?  They were doing something else. I just interrupted them So I think that was a very interesting way of handling that and also the practicing aspect I mean, I The practicing thing alone just recording myself for like an hour doing the persuasive question asking  And I think I should do the same thing just hearing myself repeat, not necessarily these conversations like what I do, because it kind of changes every time I say it, which is annoying and a source of insecurity for me, So I think it's just a good, very practical exercise I could do and get an improvement in how I feel about saying this stuff.

1:03:26 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, and I'll say this, because what you're feeling right now, like I don't know if you feel this, but there's awkwardness to this, you know, it feels awkward, and that's just how it is that's okay.

It's very kind of you, very generous. But I will not schedule that.  But the 50 is the key aspect here, which is, it's not just, oh, practice a little bit, it's like practice 50 times.  That's right.
