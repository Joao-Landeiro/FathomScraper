0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so we're back. We were just talking about the purpose of the employee portal, right? employee portal is basically a data collection tool that wants to be a fun, interesting, engaging data collection tool.  Is this a good synthesis?

0:21 - A L
  Yeah, it makes it easy for your chat to create the place. I would say the purpose engages employees in ESG.  Okay.

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you connect this? I think of the purpose it serves.

0:44 - A L
  If we want to go even more meta-battery or something like that, ideally it's so engaging that employees will tell other people about it and other companies will be like, oh, I'm at ESG or I do this.

0:56 - Mau Medeiros
  There's some kind of social effect to it.

1:00 - A L
  Mm-hmm.

1:06 - Mau Medeiros
  So, I'll try to capture that.

1:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I guess she's so interesting. Share about it with other people.

1:26 - A L
  With people outside of the company or internally within the company, but they'll talk about it.

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Inside and outside. Do you agree with this statement? Yeah. Okay. So, on what we assume to be true, we added two more things in this session.  added these two. Of this stuff that we assumed to be true, do you think there are things that we have a higher confidence level and some other things that we are less sure about?

2:19 - A L
  I think it's useful to have centralized place. That's probably true. That's more pretty high confidence. I think managing multiple communication channels is true.  Compliance officers would use your data collection, that is true. Um, I think companies might have, uh, I would like that would probably be lower, but like on true the top part, that one, uh, because it'd be higher up in the middle, probably.  And, um, users prefer not to need another login. think that's true. All right. And then, um, I think the other thing around the easiness around it, uh, do I have high confidence?  No, because there hasn't been a tool that has really tried to do this before, you know, so I don't know, but that's my assumption based off of my experience.  I, I, that would be like, kind of, that would be one of the differentiating parts of us compared to other tools.  I'm making it easy for employees to do it. They just say you need to do it, you know.

3:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So you was, that's kind of in the middle or on the top half of the thing?

3:58 - A L
  Yeah, I have no idea. Yeah like these are like we're not unsure but this is my assumption. I don't think you guys, you know, would you would you Would you prefer that like you know as a employee like you probably would but I don't know if it's gonna Change your participation or you guys will still do that bare minimum even if it's a bad tool, right?  I'm not sure Yeah I think Expenses like you want to get your money So you'll do even if it's a crappy tool you'll probably fill it out because you want to get your money out of it, right?  But but other things maybe you just won't and you're like if you look at like I click on a survey and I realize It's too long.  I'll just give up, right? And then not you're not so yeah I think one of the things that is usually helpful in this stuff is to appeal to the more Selfish reasons for people doing things, right?

4:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so because those are very resilient to emotion like I'm always selfish. I sometimes feel

5:01 - A L
  Yeah, so exactly what is the selfish thing about it like I'm not sure like you get it done or like you can brag about it or you can like, like maybe there's a leaderboard and you can be like, yep, now you know, you, you know, I don't know, but that's kind of the feeling.  Yeah. Yeah, we could.

5:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the reason why we're doing this this grading is precisely to surface. Because this is normal, Everything's an assumption.  Everything's an hypothesis. But when we surface this stuff, we can start to have a different conversation about, oh, what could I do to try to increase my confidence level on this?  And maybe I'll just disprove something that I thought it was true. But now I don't waste that effort, right?  So this stuff that I've marked in a slightly different way, I'll just keep it this way because it was new.  But we can refer back to this at some point to figure out what's like the leanness.

6:00 - A L
  play of getting a huge ROI for like okay so I'll do a quick question error I'll ask like four people and this is enough for me to increase my confidence level on this thing enough that the next task makes sense otherwise I'm just you know in the dark room you know we have like so next week next week I have introduced I think I invited you guys we have like customer pilot meetings you know like just also to hand over from from Rui and them so we could like you guys can join and ask some of these questions too that you might have you know it's like okay now we're the employee portal we have some questions and then and get it is a 30-minute meeting so it'll be tight but it's good a good you know conversation around that yeah cool can also help you I don't know if you have already a script for these conversations but we can also help you usually has one but it's because it's only 30 minutes and they haven't seen a lot so we're hoping that we can show them like some of the designs that we have and  We need to actually chase up an update from Pryrui on some of these things, what can be shared.

7:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

7:12 - A L
  OK. Perfect.

7:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on this front, basically, the conclusion of this is that some aspect of this, we are more confident. aspects, are not so sure.  It doesn't mean that we are less confident. It's just that we are as more of an unknown, right? So related to unknowns, from these four things that we do not know, We have some assumptions, but we do not know.  What task should we make the easiest task for the employee? OK.

7:51 - A L
  For the employee as well?

7:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

7:55 - A L
  Yeah. I'll to create an incentive. Yeah. one is we definitely don't know that one how to create it or how to create an incentive for employees not to track their ESD tasks but make them do their ESD tasks and then I do like I think it has to be like in the email or in the communication that we send I worry a little bit based on what I've seen so far is that employees won't even click on it because they think it's spam like you know if you get an email being like fill in your policy thing and then like as it looks like doesn't look like it from the company but that's maybe something that can be fixed like they might be like I don't want to do this because this is a third party tool or something so we need to figure out you know how to manage that that's really interesting because right now there's a lot of pressure for cyber security phishing tests and stuff like that right yes so I think because I've seen some of the emails that we like the developers are making and it was like the language wasn't that good it wasn't that bad and people would be like I'm not clicking this you know so we would have to you know do something

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  internal communication first you know to the whole organization outside of this tool probably be like please watch out but then we need to you know uh yeah check on that yeah yeah okay okay this is really interesting because that sort of consideration uh I think it aligns more with uh not just product but also go to market and even like the setup phase of like educating the the owners of the tool right yeah okay uh anything else that we you feel that we we are more unsure like we really don't know about because you've mentioned this stuff you've mentioned the no I think well what we don't know um yeah well employees like using it I guess is one the things do we have um because I've seen I've seen  the stuff around benchmarks, right? And most of the stuff around the benchmarks was this outside perspective of like, oh, this is how they present themselves and how they communicate, how they position themselves.  And it was more difficult to get a feeling of what it is to actually use, know, Vanta as an employee, right?

10:24 - A L
  Yeah, and I think that like, for, and the thing about it, like that, because we use Sprintow, which is like Vanta's thing, like, for me, it's like, there aren't that many tasks, I don't have to go into it that often.  And like, when I do, I kind of go in and click and I forgot that I did it, which is nice, right?  Oftentimes, you get annoyed when you go into a compliance tool and you're like trying to figure it out and like , like this.  It's really easy, when you or Sprintow makes it really easy, you go in there, you know exactly what you need to do, you're done, then you move on, right?  And so you don't have this bad feeling about it. Yeah.

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah So I'm trying to connect that with yeah my point is We do not know I assume this you can please if I'm wrong we don't know we do not know exactly how our Other employees of our perspective clients feel about this stuff, right?  Yeah, no, I don't know.

11:31 - A L
  Yeah, this is like kind of a new area We but like we know that Banta and Sprinto have like thousands of clients.  So we know that the process works because It and you know, we have some customers that are using these tools So it's not like it's not we're not creating something totally new But we are kind of doing it in this new air new adjacent area, right?  And security and privacy people are doing it but not necessarily in the ESG space Mm-hmm. Okay.

12:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just tools to an organization. Okay. Perfect. Okay. I think we can keep that in mind for this next session.  Okay. So now we are looking at the two main profiles for the employee portal. We understand that the employee portal might have different privileges like, oh, this person can approve stuff, this person doesn't approve anything, just fills out stuff.  That's clear. But for now, the employee is the average employee, not a leader, not a team leader. We would like to understand and you recognize these questions from the Valid Proposition Campus is the job to be done,  that they are trying to achieve and how they would consider that they have achieved that job and what is making it hard, right?  a good example, for instance, in terms of the compliance officers, which is an audience that we're more familiar with this, one of the things that they are trying to achieve is to have, you know, up-to-date records on a wide range of things.  Yeah. And so success for them could be several things. One of them is, you know, thoroughness of those details, also easy, you know, how easy it is to get those information, those things.  And one of the things that is making it difficult for them is, you know, different platforms, different tools, no time.  People are sending, like, not a lot of information. Sometimes they send information that is poorly formatted and then are competing for their attention towards the end of the quarter and they don't care and they have other things.  Exactly. This is my me speculating right, that's right. that's true experience. Yeah Okay So maybe we'll just bring that up and that will be a good kickstart into this activity.  So the on the blue side Thinking about compliance offices. What that what are they trying to do and we can do this together because we have so much Context from the project.  We can probably assume something.

14:22 - A L
  Yeah, like getting an overview of Of all of the compliance for the employee portal is like getting an overview of all the tasks assigned, I guess mm-hmm the other tasks assigned Get an audit trail of audit trail of all of the activities Getting an easy way to be able to Track and chase up the people who have responded So it's kind of like the last one, but it's  People who haven't done it have a central for the employee portal. think those are the maybe the main ones.  Yeah, and then like, like, able to consistently get information in real time with the important portal, like real time information.

15:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, from from our previous conversations, I would assume I would suggest we also add the kind of nudging the participants to the employees to Yeah, reminding them.  Yeah, like sending a reminder that they need to do it. And also remind them in my mind when I think about reminding, I think about something that is already passed.  It's the best time, right? Oh, please, you should have done this.

16:04 - A L
  I think one is like, it's been deployed so they'll get a reminder when it's deployed, but then we should have like, probably a due date or like, know, yeah, or something like, like when it's past due, you have several more reminders.

16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could we assume that for the compliance officer, if it doesn't have to remind people that the way the platform is built is convincing and persuasive and easy to use enough that it doesn't even have to remind most people.  Maybe it's to remind five percent.

16:36 - A L
  Ideally, yeah, exactly. That would be the ideal situation.

16:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll put incentivize employees.

16:46 - A L
  Yeah, employees, completion of tasks. Of tasks, okay.

16:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So these are all the stuff that a compliance officer would, you know, try to do with. that platform and this is the very easy segue what they would consider success in the use of the employee portal.

17:12 - A L
  To me it's like just not needing to remind people that everything is automatically works you know it's deployed you don't need to chase up it's like doing all of the chasing up or the manual things that you would need to do anyway so you just kind of know that it's under control mm-hmm could you could you restate that for me please?  I like things like a feeling of things that are are under control so that things are yeah things are updated because they're updated automatically so you have a feeling of control that everything is covered and then consider success would be like in place willingly filling in the information on time mm-hmm  And then I think, um, and then also employees being positive and not whining about the tool, you know, that's like the employees actually think the tool is useful and not bothersome.  Because they're compliance officers are always scared about bothering the business. Yeah. So, okay, that's like an, I think the audit trail or like, you know, but that goes with control.  Like, you know, the audit that it's being done so that like the overview on the tracking and all of that, that part is a success.  So if you have that information, but it's also maybe I don't know if that goes there somewhere else.

18:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because it would not help us if we have a very interesting experience that people like to do, but doesn't collect the right information, right?  Exactly.

18:47 - A L
  So I kind of like collect audit, audit and all of that have a good other ways it doesn't work and like, yeah, audit reporting.  So all of that information. Yeah.

19:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What I'm thinking is, so there are standards for these audit trails and reporting stuff, right? So I would assume that the less data wrangling I need to do the best, right?  Yeah, exactly.

19:18 - A L
  yeah, I guess it's like, yeah, streamline, they automatically get the reporting because a lot of this is done manually, right?  You send out an MS forms and then you go and get to Excel and then you need to update it anytime someone else updates the MS form, then you need to, you know, look at again and put in another thing.  So automatically done.

19:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Willingly filing information on time is important. Yeah, positive not whining. Okay. And again, from the perspective of the employee portal, we understand that it doesn't

20:00 - A L
  exist right now. So this is a bit of an assumption for the compliance officer or it'll make it hard if the employees don't use the tool right because then it's kind of then there's going to have to do a lot of the chasing and different things and if like the employees so I think one of the employees don't use the tool or employees are scared to use the tool you know because they're worried about like data privacy like yeah I'm probably they're not going to be scared there's to be a few but it was more like employees just still don't prioritize it right it's like you could do all that but everyone's trying to hit their numbers and their targets and they still don't use the tool right that could be I think.

20:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when you when you when I when I go back to times where I had to fill up this this sort of stuff yeah I was I was that employee

21:00 - A L
  Right. I've been that employee on other things too. yeah, right.

21:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what it comes to mind is it's like if it's not immediately clear what I need to do I'll just write the note on my to-do list like figure out what to do and then that's like a thing right I need a half an hour to figure out what the task is and then exactly okay okay so perhaps employees not understanding what it's expected of them exactly yeah not employees not understanding what expected or how long it will them yeah okay  So more things that prevent people from using the platform.

22:12 - A L
  I think like the single sign on or like, you know, if I get login things, I give the single sign on is not working or they have the extra login and authenticate and get in.  People get kind of annoyed at that and don't try to do it. Okay. So what I will say now is a little bit of speculation, but based on what we've talked so far, maybe it makes sense or it's just useful for discussion.

22:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This sort of tasks, the outcome is just people stop bothering me, right? I don't get anything. I don't have a sense of oh, I've achieved something's like oh somebody will stop anointing anoint me But not anoint me anymore if I do this right so I don't the compliance officer side employee side.  Yeah.

23:17 - A L
  Yeah for the employee I Think it's more that they don't need to get chased. I was thinking we're on the compliance officer side, right?  So that's it. Yeah, you're correct. I'll leave that for For the other one.

23:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so let me I don't know if that's how you write the nice Okay, so Now we'll put on our  heads and think about the internal employees. So internal employees that are not necessarily related to the topics of ESG, what are they trying to do?  This is a very general question. Well, what are they trying to do?

24:24 - A L
  Well, I think they're just trying to do their jobs and the minimum thing that's required for them, you know.

24:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

24:50 - A L
  Yeah.

24:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One of the things that, again, I mean, in this section, a lot of what we'll say is a little bit of speculation.  So some of these things we are more confident Others were less but one of the things that that relates to what we've discussed is for an employee that is you know negotiating different Platforms for from like there's something from our cutting.  There's something from compliance. There's something from Health and safety, you know all of the stuff HR So they have all these different platforms, right?  And these different attributions that they need to work on I think there's something There's something here related to figure out what is more important, right?  Like if I cannot do everything the thing I will not do is I know maybe some tasks that Comes from a department that I don't really care too much about Yeah, like for employee.

25:49 - A L
  It's more like Not being chased You know like just getting things done and off their off their to-do list, you know making their to  do this really clear of what they need to do and just getting it done, you know, compliance. I think sometimes like, you know, compliance people are not good at giving the messages on why you need to do this or when, and often it's extremely ad hoc.  So like, you know, come out of nowhere because compliance people are trying to figure this out manually. But if there's like a consistent thing, you know, like at the first of the month or like whatever, you always get a reminder about different things like you kind of know, like, you know, okay, and like, and that could be something I hadn't thought about.  But like, you know, every month, there's a kind of a reminder like your paycheck is coming every month, you know, like you need to do these stuff and this stuff and stuff.  So it's a more like not like ad hoc setting, like sometimes compliance people will be like, all right, this is launching, you need to do this now, because we need to make this deadline for the board thing and then push all the employees to do it at the same time, you know, because it launched.  So there's a little bit more consistency, a little bit less drop and it's become something in a day to day.

26:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think I think that that deserves like a separate posted along the lines of predictability. of understanding what's coming not not getting caught you know by surprise something like that would you agree with that sorry what what is it so what did what you just said to me I would synthesize that in terms of as an employee I don't get caught off-guard I want to know what's coming yeah so like the worst situation is getting receiving an email or a ms team's message from the compliance officer oh you have until four o'clock today to do this otherwise we get a huge fine right exactly okay okay it's coming okay um anything you want to add here or you can just slide down to the next thing  So for an employee, what would be success even that what they're trying to do?

28:12 - A L
  Would it be successful? I think that's maybe this is linked to them feeling good if they do it and then the success is like, hey, I saved the tree or something like that.  like, I don't know, that's the hard thing about compliance. Compliance people are always like, yeah, this is so great.  I did compliance. It's more like, I just need to do it, right? And how do I do it in a way that bothers people at least.  So success, they're able to do it in one go or do it in a very short time, I guess.  You know, Mal, what's your question?

28:48 - Mau Medeiros
  It's just a comment about that because on top of everything that they have to do, sometimes, Even when the company hires 45 as a tool for ESG, not necessarily the company is going to be aligned with everything, so it's going to be a process about implementing the culture of ESG, and maybe the tool in the platform is part of it, but in terms of personal realization or personal engagement with ESG, I think that's something there can tackle, somehow to make them feel special about doing that on top of what the company is just like trying to do, because sometimes that could be a kind of a disconnection and the speech is not going to be the same, so me as a person, I can engage with that.  I can feel special and I can feel realized or engaged on top of the company. What's doing? I think this this compares about you know time and speed about engaging with the platform something just to it's not a question it's just like a reflection here you know and how we can all the time make the platform dialogue with the final customer and make them feel connected and engaged with ESG so it's that kind of award the prize and that when it comes to gamification that could be something I just have to play around so it's just a comment yeah no yeah so I think that would be really and that's why I feel like if we make it like a little bit of interesting compliance to like when they do a conflict of interest register it's not like I need to do a conflict of interest register

31:00 - A L
  It's like, why are you doing a conflict of interest register? Because you're protecting the company. You're preventing corruption, which affects the development of a country.  There's a greater good on why you're doing it. that could be a learning part of it. But it's like, motivate them a little bit more.  not just like, oh, I need to do this because compliance does it. But it's like, why are we doing this?  It's not just the avoid fines. But there is actually a greater good reason. There's a strong correlation between countries lost a lot of corruption to countries of higher amount of corruption and economic development for all people.  So it's like, there is some kind of goodness that you can maybe play to. yeah, so I think that could be something interesting.

31:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Absolutely. mean, yeah, there's a thread that connects all of this stuff. So perhaps bring here a new aspect, which is, I don't know.

32:00 - A L
  do well by doing good that sort of thing yeah yeah like yeah something like that yeah okay um one aspect that I think is quite universal in terms of you know every job almost it's looking good for your boss right something like being visible as yeah either like just like sometimes on compliance you end up having to chase the line manager to get the employee to get their job done you know and that's but you know that happens but do this as employee again trouble usually not it's more that they just you know the line manager houses them but I think um yeah but I think that it's obviously people don't like to be chased and they don't like to be cut off guard like we said up there so it's like there's a common pace for  for things around there but um yeah I'm not sure.

33:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What I had in mind and I don't know if this is too far a stretch but what I had in mind was like oh so my boss which is busier than I am yeah can see that he never has to chase me around for the sg stuff he can see that I'm reliable and dependable right yeah something along those lines like is it like a card or something like that then they I'm not sure yeah I don't know exactly how these manifests in the tool and in a row great you know on time good job and you get you know yeah I don't know because I think especially you know very career conscious people that's kind of a playbook right so you gotta took your own horn and you gotta have like ammunition for those conversations about getting promotion and stuff like that I don't think you'll ever get a promotion for a different area that is not compliance  It's not like that you do answer things on time. But it could be a sign that tells your boss, oh, this person is good at self-managing, or they don't give me trouble, or they stay on top of things.  have an image of being dependable. So I think I would try to synthesize this in terms of something along the lines of being visible or having arguments to take to your boss about, well, you do stuff, right?  Of course, of course, it's under a good light. Let's see. Based on what we said above, I would also assume.  and please correct me that not everybody's like this but for a lot of people or for some people being able to plan out your work with a little bit of reading room it's usually a good thing right yeah I think this is kind of like not getting caught on guard but just kind of knowing what you need to do and just so you can get it done or just get it done faster um yeah okay so that's kind of the the other side of I'm trying to not be caught off guard so I'll love to be able to plan out my my week or my quarter or something like that okay is there anything else you'd like to add here?

35:54 - A L
  no I don't think so yeah okay so

36:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's making it hard and perhaps after these exercise will take like a five minute break or something? what's making it hard for for the employee the lack of prioritization, right?

36:12 - A L
  We'll just don't prioritize ESG or compliance. They have like their regular jobs that they need to do I think if what makes it hard is that Yeah, lack of prioritization lack of interest yeah And then I get like the tools to make it difficult a lot of I feel that from my experience a lot of the compliance tools Make it so difficult to understand how you there's a joke in the Compliance community that most of the compliance tool are so complex that you need to hire a full-time person to manage it on behalf of your Organization so that's what makes it hard as I can please find it too difficult to log in too difficult to do It's not a very fun  phase people like just like you know I had one reporting to what I hated doing I had to have my admin do it with me because it was so difficult to understand I just had like a bad feeling every quarter that I had to fill out this tool you know so I think that's where it gets hard to do.

37:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's dive into that specific experience what made it hard for you like specifically on that tool?

37:23 - A L
  The user interface was just horrible you didn't know where you're supposed to go or what you were supposed to do yeah there are like so many subsections of subsections that you need to go in and out of yeah you didn't know where to put what you're doing so there's a lot yeah it's confusing navigation it was like too many subsections so it's like you go into one button and you go to another one go to another one you kind of lost track of where you are and there weren't very clear directions on what you were supposed to do so you're like like so like the lack of directions or a lack of  he's made it really understanding like how do I do it so I have to and because I think this is the sound it's like a lot of these compliance activities you don't do it that often right so it's like you don't and so when you go in so it's like literally every quarter I kind of forgot because I have to do it once a quarter and then I'll be like oh  how do I do this again like I don't understand this tool it doesn't make sense and then yeah at the end I just had my ad to do it all the time because I couldn't figure it out it was just really annoying like I still think about it anger right that's a lot of compliance tools are so I want that opposite effect of fortifying like it then you know yeah that's a very I think that's a very interesting point or the the fact that things that we've I have these all the time like booking things for like a holiday yeah because they only do it like a few times a year and I'm always like oh I don't especially like

39:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Low cost airlines and stuff like that. is this the part where they tried to trick me or all the parts of the parts where they tried to trick me, right?  Yeah So, okay, okay, that's very good Was there anything related to the fact that you needed to do it in in one go?

39:18 - A L
  Like he didn't save Yeah, if you stop Did save the information but it was just so lost like you like there's so many subsections you kind of got lost like Did they save this information?  Did it go through here? I'm not totally sure if it went through, you know, and it's just like You weren't we weren't sure if you actually did the task, you know, okay?

39:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Okay, okay, this is very useful because we can use this to point towards specific things you can do in the interface, right?  like small nudges like

40:00 - A L
  like, oh, form saved, or this is done, it changes, stuff like this, really helpful.

40:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, okay. What other things might be making it hard?

40:18 - A L
  I think it's like maybe competing interests, right? But like, there's a lot of other work to do, I guess makes it hard for employees to focus on it, you know, getting it caught in spam so they don't notice it, like not standing out enough, it looks like another like email or a spam that you need to do so people don't realize they need to do it.

40:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's really interesting because, mean, we used to think that this competition for attention happened in our personal lives, right?  But now it also happens in our professional lives. every tool needs to talk was in a way that captures our attention with, it's like even the banks, don't know how it is in Norway, but here in Brazil like banks, like especially digital banks are sending like this cute messages with funny copywriting and some people don't like it.

41:14 - A L
  Yeah, but I like that just reminded me because I like, so we're using kind of the startup bank that makes the user interface so easy that I love it, but they don't have all of the features that like a traditional bank has like Euro accounts and all these different things.  I still have an account in the Euro like the traditional Nordic bank and their user interface is so difficult, like it's two months in, I still can't log in, I can't like get it to work and it's so frustrating and so like it's almost the point that we want to keep the other one because it's so easy to use because like, but it doesn't have as many features as this old established one, but that's like a feeling like I get really annoyed that like I've literally had the account for September and I can't log in so many different ways of doing it.  There's like this this startup one, it's so easy. Like you just log in, you get in, you can see exactly what you need.  So we're thinking of actually not getting the startup and using both of them because we use our interface of that startup more.  Mal, raise your hand.

42:15 - Mau Medeiros
  Yeah, I think what Joan brought here is very interesting in terms of having a user type as a bank.  Yeah. I did a huge project for Banco do Brasil, which is the largest bank here in Brazil, four or five years ago.  Only the HR department is 900 people. How well?

42:45 - A L
  Which is huge.

42:47 - Mau Medeiros
  I did this job about employee experience five years ago and now they contacted me recently because they still didn't manage to...  design, an important experience, which is aligned with, you know, the current people's mindset in terms of new generations and how to deal with people and everything.  So they are very behind. So I think that that's interesting aligned about what you said in terms of it has to be very easy because they have a lot of tasks to do.  And even when it comes to employee experience and talking about, you know, something else, which is more than numbers, yeah, when it comes to the financial segment, it's very hard to implement and it is interesting in a way of thinking about the business itself is how to maybe in the future to adapt for different contexts.  in terms of how to approach this customers, especially these ones that they have a lot to do during the day, or a lot of tools to do.  So I think it's interesting user case to tackle in the future. So I think that that could really improve the platform in terms of how to connect with people in a very, very, very, very easy way.  So yeah, just another comment that, know, I'm just writing down and then just like verbalizing.

44:36 - A L
  yeah, I think it is a good way because a lot of the compliance tools out in the market now are like the banking, like the old banking kind of tools that are very like difficult and like harsh and like kind of very line based, you know, kind of also like our previous designs, a lot of boxes, a lot of boxes, a lot of boxes.  One of the actually most popular accounting tools in Norway is something called beacon, F-I-K-E-N. I know and it just is the whole total UI is like step one do this and has cartoons and it kind of like makes this like really tedious process of accounting very easy.  And that's kind of the same idea I want to do with four to five because I think it just took off because a lot of people just want to be told what to do how to do it and done in a nice way that's not like frustrating so I think to keep in mind around that aspect of it is important.

45:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because one of the things I was scribbling here on the side is we are serving users of course, and we have this ultimately we need to make part of the decisions right so we have users and then we collect information from them in many different ways one of them could be interviews.  We take this information we synthesize it synthesize it into. guidelines and these guidelines inform our product decisions, right? So users, that collection, guidelines, product decisions.  And one of things that like from hearing you talk occurred to me is, and this is just like top of my mind, the Toyota analogy is very useful in terms of communicating expectations around what is quality, right?  Quality differs between audiences, right? For some people, quality is like, oh, I want it to be dependable, dependable for others is like I want it to be luxurious and so on.  But now this example, we've, you know, got into the banking, I think is a really powerful way of communicating this.  So, because people, not everybody has a Toyota, right? people, a lot of people, I think, have a more firsthand experience with using a digital bank.  versus a traditional bank, and I think this is not a decision, of course, this is just a thing that came to be, but maybe there's something there in terms of the way we communicate this.

47:13 - A L
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I agree. I know, I think that's a good point then, like, because like beacon.no, I put the thing in the chat, but that was actually our original blueprint when we started a year ago, and I feel like we've gone away from it and we've kind of lost it in all of this discussion around ESG, but it is really taking like a traditional sector and like simplifying it, making it a lot more user-friendly, and I think it's the the same thing I noticed that, you know, with our bank folio, which also does something very similar versus the traditional one, so I think it's a good way and I think it is a good messaging because a lot of people do get frustrated with the banking apps and how horrible they are, so yeah, a good way to do it.

47:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, okay, we can just, I just didn't want to miss But anyway, so now we have, we have the two sides of the decoration, right?  The compliance officer and the internal employees. And it's relatively clear that by making it easier for the internal employees, we'll make it easier for the compliance officer, right?  And now we can look a little bit at what it looks like right now, okay? And to be honest, I quite like the way it looks right now.  So my angle here is not one of, you know, putting it down. It's just like, we can connect these things, right?

48:37 - A L
  I think it's fun to be honest, cause like this is like just like a nice user interface, but it's still very boxy, right?  It's very like form stripping kind of thing, right? Like if you, if you look at like beacon, like they, you know, sometimes have cartoons or they sometimes have different things in it, that make this like really important.  task or less intimidating. I guess less intimidating is my goal. I think the colors are nice to make it less intimidating, but it does feel like a lot of boxes.  But I'm quite open at this point. This is so much better than most of the compliance tools out there, so I would be happy with this.  Yeah, exactly.

49:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My apologies. I think there's someone knocking at my door and I'll be back.

49:32 - Mau Medeiros
  Yeah, I agree with that when it comes to being very boxy. I think this is the first thing that people start trying to avoid.  So I don't know, this is the part of the creative development of this project. I was just thinking how to put something  interesting in the middle of the journey you know which is more playful or more informative or something and then you go to the next phase after you just see something beautiful on the screen or important on the screen or a kind of message so not you keep the same flow as just blocking everything and just making just checking all the boxes you know it's bring something to the experience that you know is kind of something in between I don't know I don't know how or but just this is something just came to my mind or when you swap screens or you go to the next phase something like that yeah so that would help yeah the other hand I think it's very boxy but I really like the color  I think it is kind of fluid and easy. I don't know exactly how you intend to work with the branding and, you know, the visual identity in the future.  as it's now, I think it's okay. I think it's important.

51:19 - A L
  I think we'll probably have to change the branding when we have more of the product done to kind of match the product.  You guys could help us with that. But so I think this is nice. I think it's a lot of boxes, but I think it's still going to be much better than what is out there.  I the more fun and quirky that we can make it, think, yeah, if you just go to Pitch.no and you kind of click on it, they have a free trial you can see.  You can do a translation button on your browser and you can see how they do it. it's like, you know, this is how you set up your articles of association.  is how you do this. So it takes a really, like, finance and whatever.

52:00 - Mau Medeiros
  but then makes it like you know their their headline is super easy you know accounting right and accounting is like much easier than you think like we can do it we help you do it yourself right so it's a very similar model and we kind of taken off because a lot of people will use them versus consulting so if we could do something even like vegan style like I think that could be good too yeah I think from a branding perspective I don't know how exactly or how you're going to tackle but I always think about everything which is figurative or something about how the brand expresses itself but it comes something about the symbol yeah the logo so how are you how are you telling that story in a way it doesn't need necessarily to be literal but how is you know the power of the symbol or the meaning of the symbol  to tell stories.

53:01 - A L
  Yeah and that's why we have you know like how we had done it is it's like I was just trying to find like a like and I'm happy for the logo to change we just kind of made a firefly because we're saying you know we like the path towards you know compliance so people can follow the firefly and like you know get out of the forest or you know fire it's kind of leading by example there you know um but I think it's also I know that like eggs and kind of we try on a different type of firefly or different things and I think we could also incorporate the firefly more if you want like step one you know kind follow the the thing if you want to do something cartoonish but like um but that was the idea of the firefly before we had two x that were kind of looking like a brick wall like to like to build up and then we kind of changed the firefly right before the summer but I'm not really like I'm not like to hold into it I'm happy to change it too if we feel like okay the design will actually be better reflected with like the lumina like the sun then we can also change too so it's uh I'm pretty into like artistic direction from you guys on what you think like the  everything.

54:01 - Mau Medeiros
  Yeah I think just look at you know the current website when a radio or something like that it's just like how to incorporate and make the Firefly tell a story or be part of the whole journey instead of only being on the left top corner of you know the platform it could be you know the element of you know of dialogue somehow.

54:28 - A L
  Yeah I think you can see it like it flies around the thing but I agree like I think we need to rethink our whole branding once this product is like furthering and then have it's ready for market then we you know we can change everything you know on that so that's I agree with that.

54:45 - Mau Medeiros
  Yeah because you know it's just like trying to the traditional form of US interface of course we have to follow some rules and get the journey but  I know how yet, but I just think that, you know, it's really comes to my mind in terms of evolving about what we have already.  Yeah. That's great. Yeah.

55:15 - A L
  Okay, so I'm back.

55:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for for reading. So, in the meanwhile, did you discuss something about this screen we are looking at?

55:30 - A L
  No, I think it I think it's fine. think if you always want to make it more creative, you're welcome to.  Otherwise, it's still much better than it was before. One thing you need to consider is that is more about language because we probably will have to translate it and then translate different versions of it for different languages for our customers.  Eventually, I don't know that affects the design, but you just like just be aware that we might have different languages like some other ones that are in there.  So, like, there could be people who like, you know, some of the. I would say factory floors for some of our pilot customers, they might not have actually that much education.  So like, you know, having more symbols or having a very clear, you know, what it means could be good too, like very simple for them.

56:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's, there's, so on the subject of making things easier to use or safer. There's that kind of a pyramid, think, and the first approach removes the complexity, of course, is always the desire thing.  then the next thing is that you just kind of create boundaries around the complexity, so people know you're now entering a complex zone, Like deleting an account on social media, they ask you to confirm.  And one of the, one of the things that, you know, we have that is is less integrated, but it's very flexible.  So it's the onboarding experience, right? So when people join for the first time, when they enter for the first time, maybe the interface is not self-explanatory because it's a bit of a, it's a difficult thing to pursue the self-explanatory interface because people have different expectations and so on.  But we could have like a journey that people join and they go through it and any interface, even if it's a little bit complex, it becomes simpler because it's like a tutorial.  I don't know if you're into video games, but video games do this really well. So that's an approach we could take, which is a little bit less about the way it looks statically and a little bit more how information is gradually presented.

57:49 - A L
  I'm really open on that. you guys are the experts here, I really have strong opinions. Yeah.

57:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So about this. What I like about this is it's very easy to quickly understand what's happening and what you need to do, which addresses some of the things we discussed before.  You did mention something about the language, and I tend to agree with that, which I think is normal for this stage of the project, which is just naming things what they are from an expert perspective.  As the project advances, we start to label things from the perspective of the user that might have a different point of reference.  Status of submissions is a very expert oriented language. My form is perhaps a more user oriented language, but this is very easy to work with.  Basically, for almost all of the things, there's some aspect of a form, which sending information, and with Roméo Romeo has found, has listed a few good practices for like forms that I think will be very useful here.  This idea of the review is very good as well and as a submission confirmation which I think connects with that thing you said before of did I do the task, did I finish the task, is the thing actually done, know, stuff like that.

59:25 - A L
  Yeah, I could be having a section called completed task where they can check and I realized at the home, but one there, there is probably, there's no button, like the first picture on the top left of that page of where we are.  Where does it say like, oh yeah, status of some police, that would be where you would like have a CO submission, yeah, so you can see where you've done it, yeah, and there, as I say that that's important to have that, so that's good.  Yeah, no, so I think that's, I think it's fine. I think it, I think be more fun. I think it could be a little bit more like you know like yeah but I this is also good also for what it is right so it's uh yeah um yeah I I tend to agree with you on that but a quick question just to be sure when we and I know you've mentioned the the examples but just uh explain me like I'm five um when you when you say you want it to be more fun the the image that it paints in my mind is closer to like uh mascots animated mascots kind of Duolingo sort of vibe that's like yeah probably like a Duolingo kind of fun more gamified you know like so people's like are kind of used to like you know scrolling right like you know how do you make it like easy for that and then also like you know you go into like maybe you're right that it needs to be like a step or something like you you click on gifts and entertainment here and then suddenly you jump into the one on the right it's a little bit intimidating  Right, like it's like you click on this and then suddenly have a form like do we need you know, something else in between?  Okay, okay. I'm not sure but it's just like Do we need it's being like, oh, thanks for step one, you know That gives in there like a little maybe it actually has to be a little bit more information about the case and entertainment thing before you suddenly the client go into a form, right like it could be one more page or like it could be like Like a toggle being like here's more information about the gifts in entertainment.  Why is important? Whatever toggle Here's the form, you know, like rather than jumping straight into a form Like it just in terms of like the learning or explanation, you know, or why you need to do it that could actually Be helpful.  I think I see your point.

1:01:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Like we paint a picture of this so for instance, let's say I press on gifts and entertainment and the next screen is not this screen is Screen between this that just you know

1:02:00 - A L
  this perhaps very colorful like I know blue and there's like two big buttons is this a gift with the picture of a gift like a wrap gift or is this about hospitality with a picture of I don't know a glass of wine and then maybe some explanation on like you know thanks for this this is really good and then like that or it could just be like on this page but it's like a toggle you know like more information and then on one side it's like that part or on the I'm not sure because I don't know people might be like oh I don't want to like have an explanation about what it is I know what it is I just want to put it in um others might be like like so maybe it's like like two one is like an info button that they can click on you know that says this is what it gives an entertainment why it's important and then there's a link here I need to submit it so the ones who want to submit it can just submit it the ones who want to learn a little bit more I'm not sure like I'm just trying to I just like that's like feeling of like if we want to make a more petticoca call or maybe more steps like to engage with  Well, that could be a way, but I'm not sure.

1:03:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a good point, as well. Because one of the ideas that is very prevalent in the UX world is how can we create an experience that is both welcoming for new users, but also doesn't hold back experienced users.  A silly example of this is, and I'm not suggesting we start by implementing this, right? It's just an example.  It's to have, like, keyboard shortcuts, right? Expert users rely on keyboard shortcuts. Beginner users don't. So, eventually, as people get more used to this and become part of their life, something that we do not want is like, oh, my God, I cannot stand to look at this animation of the, you know, wrapping up again.  I just want to see it and do it really quickly. Yeah, exactly. OK. But also, nothing that you said was really useful for us is that you are open to the idea of maybe we need an extra screen.  Because sometimes the clients assume that the least amount of screens the better. And it's not good.

1:04:17 - A L
  I think sometimes it's better to split it up into bite-sized chunks. And that's for everything, right? Because compliance is really complex, right?  And so trying to simplify it into digestible steps And that's one of the challenges in our field is most of the time it's subject matter experts like me throwing you the book because we assume that you care about the subject as much as we do, right?  So it's really about putting in a journey that you guys will care about so you guys will actually do it.  yeah.

1:04:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, absolutely. I think that makes all the sense in the world. And the other thing is the submissions of review, which is a more detailed perspective on this big team.  It is likely, I assume, that for most people, they will not have this many at You know, it'll be like one if anything, like it's not going to be that many.  Yeah, so this is a useful idea to consider, which is if most people will have less than those, it could mean that the best design is a little bit different from a table.  But I think the table is a very easy thing to code. And if you want speed for now, I think it's probably smart.  Yeah, if you have another video on how to do it, then that's fine too. There's also another opportunity for making things funny, which is what they call empty states.  So let's say you enter the submissions area and you don't have any submissions. The best add way of solving this with just having you have no submissions that would be very easy to do, but not very interesting.  A very interesting way would be like you have no submissions and then a button like create your first submission.  Perhaps a funnier way, I like to think in terms of bronze, silver and gold options, right? So the gold option would be like maybe the little sun, what's the name of the sun?  forgot the name of the sun. They had lumina is what they named it. Lumina, yeah, maybe it will change, right?  But it would say, oh, your submissions go here, submissions are these things, if you want to do submissions.

1:06:32 - A L
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like something fun, being like, hey, you want to do your submissions, submissions are helpful for the company, like try your today, like something like that.  Totally, I think would be good. Like Twitter 404, which was the bird in the whale, right?

1:06:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  one of things that we didn't find and we've been looking for it, but maybe it's in a different file, I don't know, was the approval flow of the policies from the perspective of the employee?  Yeah. Actually, they are testing it now.

1:07:03 - A L
  And I can, let me see if I can get in. Because it's in the tool right now. They've just kind of launched it, and they're practicing it.  My computer just froze really quick. Let me see if I can find the page is not found. me see if I can.  OK, yeah. So I can, let me share my screen really quick if I can. So OK, I'll leave the entire screen as OK, do you see my screen?  It's loading.

1:08:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I see your screen.

1:08:02 - A L
  so right now it's like you get an email that says a new policy is ready for your review and confirmation Then that you guys should have access to this to for if I would change this a little bit But it's like heads up a new policy is ready for your review and confirmation Why because not being policies like hosting a great event here that I like give everything to run smoothly We view it now and stay ahead of any we could change this text, right?  And then it goes on this policy this link isn't working So then you have This dashboard link. So this is like that that live app right now, right?  So you go to come right now is that compliance map so you can see that it's being built And this is like a new version of Luma, which I'm not sure and it kind of needs more wings But then you have the policy part here and then Okay, well now it's not there, but it where's the employee There was that there's an there's a view an employee view, but I don't see it actually here  This is the deployment view. Maybe they're still working on it, maybe I wonder if I could access the homework.  No, access denied. There's an employee view where you go in and you check off where you go in and check off that you've seen it.  Yeah, so you're going to email and then you go into the tool and the tool has a check off.  I have a, actually, let me share my screen because I was, it's actually in the Slack maybe, but maybe you guys don't see that channel.  Let me share my screen because we're looking at this yesterday. Let me see. Let me see. This is a screenshot I'm trying to find, I'm going to put it here, you third, let me send this one, I think it's in this one, so okay now let's see if this one works, no, but they have it goes in like this, do you see this screen?  I see a screen, submit your request and report an incident, I couldn't find it and then actually down here like you see these three dots then you go in and it's like review the policy and then you look at the they pop up the policy and then you just sign off on it but if you guys go in the tool you might be able to see it but that's kind of how it's set up right now but I wouldn't say it's like it could be  It's not ideal, but that's kind of how it's how it's done Does that make sense? It does so just to see if I got it what you showed me was first the email Yeah, I'm just gonna write to connect it and link to the employee photo Okay, I just asked for a link so I can send it to you guys too, but yeah, okay Oh Yeah, I'm here.

1:11:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah So what what you've shown us was there's this email and the email would take us to that section and you showed us Screenshot of that in the mobile form and there's two buttons like either I approve or I do not approve, right?  Well, yeah

1:12:00 - A L
  submit a request and then report an incident, like just kind of a thing. But there's another one for policy, which is like review a policy and then you go into this policy section where you review a policy.  But that's the mobile version. need to get the actual like the the web version so you guys can look at it.

1:12:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:12:22 - A L
  But basically that's interaction right?

1:12:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I get an email. The email takes me to a place where I have two buttons. I have the content and I have two buttons that confirm.

1:12:31 - A L
  It goes to a portal, but the way that they had done the link, like it went to like this submit a request, but maybe it should have actually gone.  I think they said it should have gone to the policy section. But whether or not there should be so many sections is another question too.  But I think that I think there is a drawing that they're taking it from. So it must be like somewhere in the figma, I think, for policy.

1:13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  about policy approval screen. OK. So that's good. That's good news, actually, because we have something more developed. OK, sharing the screen again.  The training. The training is going to develop now.

1:13:27 - A L
  So the workflow for training and communications and policy is pretty much exactly the same. The only difference is training is either a PDF or a PowerPoint that they confirm in.  The rest of it is very similar. It's like, I think the tool is not working for me to show you, but it's like, you you click on it and then there's a policy that you select from.  You edit the policy. It's very similar to the one that's in the Figma. And then you do that. And then you get an email notification saying you need to confirm.  or review the training and then you look at it, the policy, and then you sign off at the bottom of it and then review and accept it.

1:14:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I mean, no, that thing is that we could find out on the pigment for sure. My point is, so earlier today in this session, we're having now, we've mentioned that maybe the in-play portal could be this place where people would go to learn more about ESG, And that takes me to a place of, maybe there's internal courses or video lessons or PDFs you can download, stuff like that.  And my question around that is, there's a few questions. Let me just write them down. So the first question is, in terms of content, right?  So. Fortify is a subject matter expert in terms of ESG and Fortify knows a lot about ESG and how to talk about it, how to teach it to other people, what kind of questions people have and so on.  So it like from a surface level it makes sense to consider that maybe there's some sort of vanilla ESG training powered by Fortify, right, for clients that don't have their own ESG training.  And this if this were to be the case it would have to be more generalistic, right? Oh, why ESG matters?  What's the E? What's the S? What's the G? sort of thing. If we enter this world of, which I think it's what we're entering, this world of companies being able to upload their own files and their own training, it makes me think about what  if companies already have their own training platforms, right, their own internal elements, learning management? Yeah, and I think some of them do.

1:16:10 - A L
  So some have asked us, can we just link to theirs so that like, okay, others are like, we would like to replace their LMS.  I think it's more like, I think it's like also like short-term and long-term. Like if we could even get this, I would be happy, you know, but like if we want to end up doing like some kind of, you know, game or like little quizzes around, you know, ESG that you could put on the side, know, like make it fun for them, or if it's just like in doing the task that they need to do, it's more fun and it's less, you know, like I would say, like, you know, or like a little bit, like every time they do something, there's like one pedagogical pop-up that does it, right?  Like it doesn't necessarily need to be like a repository of this is what carbon accounting does, you know, because I think then you just kind of, nobody's going to really look at it and spend their Saturday looking at what carbon accounting is anyway, you know, one person, you know, and the thousands would do that.  So I don't think we should spend time... I'm on that. I'm creating like an ESG repository in the task that they need to do already, where can they learn a little bit more so they understand why they're doing it and what it's about, you know.  Okay, okay.

1:17:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  not a separate thing, but more within the test. ahead. Yeah. Okay. More info within the test. Okay. I don't know.  Here. Perfect. Okay. So I'm bringing everyone with me to me. So connecting these two things, right? Especially the red side of the employee, internal employees, right?  What they would consider success and how are we making it, you know, easier with our own platform, right? Let me just copy a few positive notes here.  Okay. So So, by seeing what I need to do, seeing how what I need to do fits with your overall picture, I feel that right now, because we don't have many screens on that, that's something we could improve, right?  It's not very explicit, like, oh, you're doing this gift and hospitality form, because there's this legislation and we have observed that, right?  So, I would add that there's an opportunity here to connect with the why. Would you agree with this? Would this make sense to you?  Yeah, like, there's even white space on that form, right?

1:18:44 - A L
  Like, you know, that, there's white space on that form that you can be like, you know, this is like, I guess, and thanks for doing gift and hospitality and like, something like very simple, like this helps, you know, blah, blah, blah.  There's a lot of things that you can do within like the form that they need to do.

1:19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That gives them some more context Another thing that it's Interesting that we could do is for instance when there's a confirmation of the submission.  Okay We also have an opportunity to connect with the thanks for doing this because now you like save the world Yeah, exactly And this is not even a technical challenge.  It's just uh, yeah Writing in content challenge here Okay So There's also I also see and this is I mean this for this section.  We are pretty much freestyle, right? but there's also I think an aspect of some things you need to do a few times a year, right?

1:19:55 - A L
  and When you do them and you take them away from you, mean

1:20:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, they're not in yet to do this for a while, right? You just bought yourself some time. Yeah, yeah.-hmm.

1:20:09 - A L
  Uh-huh.

1:20:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  uh, time, free, uh, no need to redo in less than X days, okay? So, there's maybe something here, okay?  This connects with being able to plan out their work. And there's also, I mean, when we, when we move into the space of just text and content, there's so many opportunities.  Because there's also an opportunity, I think, to connect with how well you're looking for your boss, right? So, for instance, let's say you fill out the, the, the gift submission.  Yeah. And there's like 30 people that should do it, and you're number 14.

1:21:07 - A L
  You don't need to do anything else besides just pointing that out to make people think, oh, okay, next time I want to be, you know.

1:21:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay.

1:21:16 - A L
  That would be not necessarily on these ongoing subscription ones, because those, like, nobody would do it at the same time.  But there are anti-conflict of interest register or policy review or things that, when it goes to the organization all at the same time, then there is something, but there are some that are, like, depending, like, if you happen to meet with a government official at the time.  But for the ones that are, you know, like, you need to review this policy that goes to everybody, then, yeah, those probably make sense.  Mm-hmm.

1:21:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we're connecting. Sorry, my room, I need to... Okay. Okay. So lack of prioritization against their daily jobs, lack of interest.  Tools are too complex on many fronts. Okay, so here there's there's some stuff we can make More information during the form which is exactly what you've mentioned right more more eyes as you as you usually Say opportunity to add More I Buttons and in line instructions Help Okay, so this would connect with making it less complex, right?  One of the things that Could also maybe be helpful is so if this is my first time entering the platform  And we've mentioned the onboarding tutorial sort of thing. Where do I begin, right? What's the first thing I should do?  And there's these tasks, which I think are useful. Maybe we could, for instance, explore. I don't know if this is possible because we're not designing this in real time, right?  But maybe we could just gray out or make this stuff a little bit more subdued until people fill out the first activities that you need to do on your first use, right?  I don't know if I explained myself well.

1:23:52 - A L
  Yeah, I think also like maybe you don't throw everything at them at once. know, yeah, you can drop it a little bit like and then when they see more.  then we do it that way.

1:24:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's something here about language, right? Yeah. Here there's also the empty states or empty states to make it more fun.  What else stands out to you? mean, of course, this is an ongoing project, but it could be more like learning or more like eyes.

1:24:44 - A L
  think that was one of the the feedback from our pilots. You know, we don't explain enough. It's just suddenly go into a conflict of suddenly go into this, know, it goes straight.  It's a little bit too direct into the point more for like people who know it, right? if you like if you suddenly walked in, like if you suddenly  I don't know, like Mao looks at this, he's like, you know what all of these mean, like, and when you should actually be doing it.  And it just has sponsorships and donations, but it's like, why would you even click on it? Like, do you know what, when you would do it and why?  You know, it just like, there's all these boxes, but like, there's no, there's no explanation in being like, you know, like, yeah, maybe under make a subscription, make a submission.  should be like, these are, you know, there should be some line that explains like, you know, these are, these are, you know, ongoing activities when you have been to, you know, that you might come across in your day to day work.  Please plan out and apply for these in advance, you know, minimum two weeks or something like that to get your approval for your line manager.  And then like have an eye for each of them to explain what each of them mean in case they want to hover like, you know, and find out what gives an entertainment actually means because gives an entertainment might be like, gifts are okay under $100.  So then you don't have to do it for ones, you know, under $100. But like, there needs to be some kind of  Is it like going straight there like some kind of explanation a little bit like or an eyes so that they can confirm Mm-hmm.

1:26:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Don't know if this is the right time to For this sort of idea, but I'll just say it.  Maybe there's something around a Wizard, you know, like I don't know where to start then just get a few adding questions like oh AI wizard that pops up like these are the typical things, you know part of this will be a part of the training Right, there will be a policy that says like gives an entertainment under whatever need to be doing it And they need to confirm that they've read it, right?

1:26:38 - A L
  But oftentimes those look at it and those confirm that they've read it without actually reading So but yeah, it could be like a wizard that pops up or it could be like an eye in the beginning that they can Click on it to make sure that they're you know, it's clear and yeah Mm-hmm, okay

1:27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I made a note here on the side, let's go back to what's making it hard. So lack of prioritization against their daily jobs.  That thing said about plan for two weeks ahead, I thought it was really interesting because we forget that the task doesn't end with us, right?  We forget that the task needs approval from other people. So make it clear that this needs to be done by Wednesday.  I mean, maybe it's not your part that needs to be done by Wednesday. It's the whole thing needs to be done by Wednesday, right?  Dev lines, approvals, et cetera. Okay. This will be a very fun exercise for us to think about specific ways of manifesting the same thing.  to give an example, for instance, if you have a recurring task, the conflict of interest, we can, for instance, on a very basic level, just make it shine brighter when the deadline is coming close, so people know, oh, we need to do this.  We could also put some sort of visual indication that thing is hitting up, right? we have the mascot getting nervous and sweating bullets.

1:28:42 - A L
  I think that's fun, but to be honest, most of the employees are not going to be going into the employee portal every day, most likely to be triggered by an email coming, so that sweaty guy could come in and email, maybe being like, hey, you need to do this.  They're probably not going to see it in the employee portal, like growing red along the way so yeah so I think like even having the email part of the design right now because the way that they've been doing the email just like here's some text or whatever but I do think the email in itself is like quite important on how we want to like trade the messaging and what you need to do yeah I agree I agree it's a whole system right uh it's a whole okay what things could we do I think this would be a very interesting thing for us to to answer what things do we do that would make people want to check into the platform every now and then like not everybody will do it but some will what things could we do to make them want to go I don't know like to be honest I guess at the learning aspect of it or like I don't know I don't know if we should have that assumption that I guess maybe we said like we want them to  But realistically, I think about the Vanta and security and privacy, like, I don't want to go to the portal unless I'm absolutely required to.  But maybe ESG has more of a touchy-feely than, like, security and privacy. So maybe they want to go in to see the impact that they've made, or they want to see how many points that they need to get to the next level.  Maybe that, you know, that might be something if it's, like, gamified, just to check their status. But I wouldn't necessarily see it as something that they need to use all the time.  It's more that they know that they need to use it when they need to use it. Got it, got it.

1:30:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what you said just made me think of something else, which is so the integrity hub is outwards-facing, right?  But there's a certain element of bragging in an integrity hub, right? Maybe that's a thing that, you know, keeps on changing.  Like, if you enter the employee portal, I don't know if that's for this version, but at some point it could make sense.  to be oh I want to see how my company is doing right yeah the same information that goes on the integrity hub could also be in the incorporated in that no I agree okay good okay okay but I understand your point I mean is perhaps not super realistic to expect people to want to open this all the time but is if we can make it interesting when people do open it see something has changed to be uh is a bit like the slot machines right I mean they know what's going to change but something can change you could have three different views at the front page right and yeah just for instance like there's very simple things that just about  having Like three different versions of the mascot Yeah, or the mascot changes of the seasons, you know And I think you know right now this is on desktop like some of it will be done on like it I think the view will need to be like how is it done on mobile and stuff?

1:32:19 - A L
  So it's good like uh to to see there Good point good point Design it for mobile because right now the design that I showed there like it didn't totally make sense on mobile But I think a lot of this will be checked on mobile It would be like on your commute like I need to read this policy or oh, I need to review this training It is not going to be done Necessarily during the office on a desktop.  It's more likely to be done on your phone So I think if you guys can think about how this design would look on your phone And make a cool design on that like a web interface phone.  I think that would be pretty important Okay

1:33:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, and that's that also what you just said made me think of incomplete tasks. Because if I'm doing it on the phone, I'm more likely to be interrupted.  If I'm more likely to be interrupted, I want to know where to find what I was filling up a form.  Where is it? Oh, it's just here. You're just still doing it, right? Yeah.

1:33:20 - A L
  Like, you know, make a note like really like the mobile version will be key for the success of the employee portal.  So to to think about how this is going to show up on your iPhone. Most Norwegians have like an iPhone type thing.  Like, you know, like how would this look scrolling on a lot of these things?

1:33:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you would say that, of course we need both, but perhaps the desktop version is less of an unknown.  We can see it now, but the mobile version needs a little bit more love. Yeah, exactly.

1:33:51 - A L
  Okay, okay.

1:33:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we just, you know, thought a little bit about some possible ideas and some directions, and I think the biggest advantage  of us doing this ad hoc creative session was just seeing how when we are informed by what people expect from this the ideas are easy right and it's also easy to throw away ideas which is a very important thing because sometimes we fall in love with them we are creative beings we like our ideas and without this notion of what people expect from it it's just difficult to say no to an idea and this is to reinforce I think the value of next week's conversations to learn more about client so I'll shift to another I don't know if you want to dwell more on this we can we do have the time no I don't think so and so now we we bring this stuff from from the previous workshops and I mean you've done this you remember this  the the the intention behind this is to get to this like architecture of experience right more generalist take on it and the the useful aspect of doing this sort of thing is that we can question specific parts of this model right and this is what we'll try to do here I think we have space here to to ask ourselves more questions so first let's move through the whole thing and if there's something with change we can change at some point the employee enters the employee portal there's the four things they check out pending tasks and then execute them they can send a new submission and there's different kinds of submissions yeah you can check the status of past missions and they can also consume training content  other one out.

1:36:02 - A L
  And like so the way that we have set it up, I don't know, I'm thinking more and more and think about what we don't need is kind of like that, that long, like content or learning like a thing, because people aren't going to have time to look at it.  But I think how we had set it up, it's like that policy one, they get an email, you need to you need to click on this policy or you need to fill in this conflict of interest form.  So go straight to it goes straight to the task that you need to go to. And that was actually feedback from our pilots.  They didn't want to go to them early portal first, you get an email. This is the task that you need to do.  You go to the task, fill it in. And then afterwards it could be like, yay, complete and then go to the employee portal about the other tasks that you might need to do.

1:36:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it goes straight to into a specific task. And they execute the task. and then maybe they will explore the portal after doing that test, right?  And like a trigger could be like a quarterly on the top one.

1:37:10 - A L
  A trigger could be like a quarterly email reminder like, hey, have you submitted your, you know, it could be like a quarterly email reminder saying, hey, have you figured, you know, have you filled out, are you going to be traveling, are you going to meet with government officials, please, you know, check out the employee portal, and then they enter the portal from that reminder.  And then the ability to, you know, check their tasks and different things, you know.

1:37:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's also the more automated email, oh, everybody has done this, but you haven't, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Totally. Okay.  Okay. I would assume, please correct me, that there's something around ad hoc emails, like, oh, these things just came up and  Yeah, like reminder emails also right like the compliance officer can set reminders if they keep ignoring it and then saying that you need to you need to fill it in Okay So the task The test do you think the task the specific task has a link What do you think so On the email we made a link so they can just click on the link and then go straight to the task Mm-hmm, but my point is could I just copy the link and send it through my whatever system I have What do you mean?

1:38:45 - A L
  I wouldn't watch their system, okay?

1:38:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's imagine there's a company that's using I know Facebook Workspace whatever some other thing right and you want to people are used to checking those notifications and those you know  they're no communications. And you as a compliance officer, you don't wanna send another separate email, you just want to send a link that you can put into whatever communication and people click on it and go straight to the task.

1:39:15 - A L
  Yeah, I think that can work as long as, yeah, I think that's fine. Or you send them to the employee portal and then they find the task that way.  Cause then it might be hard for the compliance person to find all the links for each specific task, but it's good, like if they can do that too.  Cause yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1:39:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't think this replaces the internal email management. So I'm trying to think of, so imagine this, there's an operation that work happens at the manufacturing company.

1:39:47 - A L
  Like I would probably say that, like if you need them to do a task, like if you're gonna do a blanket email, like or either one, like if it's not like, I would probably just say go to the employee portal.  And they go like you need to you have an outstanding task go to employee portal and then they go to an employee portal and then they see their tasks that they need to do Rather than trying find out because oftentimes they'll have multiple tasks they need to do so not to have to copy everyone to lend them the task But if there's a task specific email for that task, you know when it's launched or when it's followed up, then I think it's fine To have it that way Got it got it Um, yeah, okay, perfect.

1:40:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I make sense to me. So Um The training content you said something about this you said something about removing it Yeah I think it depends on what you call training content, right?

1:40:38 - A L
  Because one of the tasks is to do training So that is one of the tasks like the specific tasks If we wanted to have like, you know, we had talked about we want this platform for employees to learn and to like care about ESG and whatever if that's the learning training content I don't think we should prioritize that or have that now because I don't think there's going to be a lot of people going in and Trying to have training content  Carbon accounting or something like that. Got it. Got it. So in that case, this is more about Because if you have content then you should say consumes poly like that's a specific task because there's a policy Content, there's a you know conflict of interest content that like there's so I don't I don't think you even need that box to be honest Because it's like pending tasks, which are linked to the specific tasks, you know, yeah And then and then that yeah Okay, and so the the tasks are Policy these procedures Communication and then controls which have a lot of subsections on a lot of the other ones.

1:41:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Okay, and all of these are a kind of task so You Okay, anyway, we got this, yeah, perfect, so let me zoom out a little bit, there's feedback on completion as well, there's different kinds of feedback we could do, we just explored some of those a little while ago, check status of pass submissions, spending tasks, submission.  Okay, these are the three behaviors that people will do on the thing, right? And it's probably like this, okay.  And for this specific task, yeah, okay, I won't copy this thing, perfect. So, did I interrupt you? Okay, so based on this, what we have discussed, we have discussed a few things, I'll just write down a few things we've discussed, so I don't  forget. There's something related to email flows, right? And also email content design and design, right? So when I talk about email flows, I'm thinking about rules, like business rules, figures, stuff like that.

1:43:19 - A L
  Content design is more visual, how it looks, what it is, right?

1:43:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And another thing that we have here is, we do not need, oh, one of the things that is not very clear to me right now, it is clear, but it's not clear if we could change it.  Yeah, it is the login aspect, right? So as it stands right now, people have like the usual email and password.  What's Uh, what's, um, I'll do, I'll do like the 45 feel about this because it's conflict with the trouble with different logins.  What do you mean?

1:44:17 - A L
  Like the different logins? Like we have single sign-on that we're setting. hopefully like this often they'll be able to go in.  perfect, perfect, But yeah, sometimes there's trouble with that and everything, yeah.

1:44:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, seeing the single sign-on probably solves like 90% of that thing. So the onboarding journey for first time users, something like this.

1:44:41 - A L
  And I think the information, like, you know, there's a lot, there's some missing information, like, you know, the I buttons, that was some of the feedback from the pilot, you know, like, why are we doing this?  Why, why are you, what is a conflict of interest? Why are we doing this? And a little bit of information to explain what it is.  Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay.

1:45:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, the other notes I have here. There's something about making the forms yeah, perhaps more friendly.

1:45:16 - A L
  Yeah, exactly. I think it's a good thing making the forms more friendly. Mm-hmm. More encouraging them to fill it in, right?  Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1:45:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:45:31 - A L
  Okay.

1:45:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Integrating more fun or character experience. Yeah. There's something to do with. Okay. I'll just write it, but this is a much bigger thing.

1:45:52 - A L
  Mobile design. Design.

1:45:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's a big thing. Yeah. gamification, we've discussed this, which is also a of a nice very issue. I'll put like gamification mechanics.

1:46:12 - A L
  like point systems or something, or like, yeah.

1:46:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  With the boards, badges, that sort of thing. Okay, now going to this. I think there's something to do around, I mean, this is just a suggestion, around interviews with the employees, right?  Even if, I mean, the next week interviews will be useful for sure. But if we could find ways, and we'll have some ideas on that, to build.  Like a model of what people are looking for a model that we could share inside of the fortifier organization We make a decision.  Oh if employees know what they want, right?

1:47:10 - A L
  So but I wouldn't mind like, you know, you can You could even do it with you guys right like give it to like people that you know Like we could send a link to them and go into the employee portal and see does it make sense for them Does I understand and get feedback from random Population that random population is probably going to be similar to the employee population, you know, but um, but yeah We can also ask the organizations like hey, can we have like five employees and like give us your feedback?  But I feel like Yeah, I don't know if I want to bother them with that part of it. I'd rather them test out the policy parts around it.  Um, yeah I I see your point and I agree with it.

1:47:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think basically, um So there there's two aspects we can We can find this information at least parts of this information without interviewing people  because there's like patterns and best practices and stuff like that that you could just could just like collate into something and you're like oh this is like a model of how these people think about this and this would not bother them would not require scheduling calls and anything like that.  If we go into the into the aspect of interviewing them it there's two ways of going about it. One of them is understanding their world which is less about collecting feedback just like tell me about your what's what's your job what you need to do what's difficult what's your experience using other tools like we don't show them anything just want to know about the world and the other approach is just oh we've done this we want to see what you think of it right.

1:48:48 - A L
  I think the first one doesn't work very well in Norway I think like what we've seen with our clients like and though we actually show them a prototype or a vision they can't even picture in their head how it would be and play they would have  something to click through so that they can actually see whether or not it works. They're not very creative people.  So either we have to have like a first guest prototype That we give and then let them click through and say is this good or not Or you know, we can like and the thing is like a person in a random company It's like it could be any of our friends Like you know, like I think we have enough network of just people that we can extend it to Because it's not really it's kind of agnostic if you're if you work at the company and you were to receive this tool Would you know how to use it and what do you like about it?  know, so it doesn't need to necessarily bother our pilot customers It could just be like our friends or like our you know, our partners and like different things around that Got it Makes sense Yeah, we can do that for sure and I agree with you.

  It's a little bit of agnostic and because it is agnostic Maybe we can even do away with interviews. just build up best practices Okay, let me get back on this tip.  Okay What else we've discussed now? Let's see what we have. Email flows What's your So there's the Lumina mask that's right and the mask is being a little bit of a An avatar, right?

1:50:42 - A L
  Yeah Yeah, like Lumina was what? Pinar created from eggs Because I think she didn't like using the she didn't like the the firefly But I really have no strong opinion.  think luminous cute. I think the firefly is cute. So if you guys think it's actually no should be something named George.  I'm fine with it, too. it's like, I think it's kind of fun for it.

1:51:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, my point about this is less about how it looks and more about its role within the experience, right?

1:51:12 - A L
  Yeah, I think it's fun to have cartoons and stuff, but I'm a little bit childish in my nature. But like, I think that like, I think that's why, like, vegan, I think that's why it's been popular.  Could you take this really boring, serious subject and you make it less, you know, intimidating and more fun and like that?  So I think the more you can do that, the more we'll stand out from the other tools that are in the market.  And that's my thing. It's like, I think if you take it a little too seriously, then you start to stand out like what differentiates you from everything else that's out there.  And that's what I'm a little bit worried about the employee portal. like, it looks nice. It looks clean. There's a lot of boxes.  It's not like distinctive that much, you know? It's maybe a little bit distinctive because it's a little bit cleaner than the other ones, but it's not like, there's no compliance tools really using cartoons now or like using different animations and that, you know, that I've seen.  that's like kind of stand out, then I think that would be good, right, to make it more fun, animated and interesting, in that sense.

1:52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In that case, because, okay, when I think about the developer, the helper character or Lumina or George, whatever, there's like layers to this, right?  The first layer is the way it looks. Yeah. And then we have a layer about where it shows up, right?  So if it just shows up as a like a logo, it's not really doing its job as a helper, it shows up at difficult moments, or if you are clicking the I and it pops up and says, oh, by the way, the definition of a gift is this, and then we have also aspects of like the way it talks to you, tone, what's kind of an acceptable joke.  So let me give you an example. Let's assume this very vanilla a sort of a mascot, right? It's like a wide circle with legs and arms.  Like an M&M, right? if we're doing on one extreme, we could have the M&M if you're looking at an empty page that there's nothing in it, right?  On one extreme, we could have the M&M picking its nose, which is kind of too funny. On the other extreme, we have like the M&M just, you know, lifting a finger, say, oh, don't forget to send up your expenses reports by, you know, so there's like, there's a, my point, I think, my point is, There's a lot of childness, and I think that, like, I think it's funny, but like, I'm very childish.

1:53:39 - A L
  So I think that it, like, you have to think this is a compliance tool at the end. It's not like too crazy.

1:53:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then, you know, people need to use it.

1:53:47 - A L
  But I think that I'm not against like also going rogue too, to be honest. I think it's kind of funny, like, God, compliance is so freaking serious that, you know, like, once it's not, you know,  Like I don't know, I wouldn't mind like you draw a few ones and show it to the pilot customers and see if it's gonna send their workforce, you know, like Or like that.  I don't have a strong opinion on it, but I do think making it more fun and friendly It goes a long way In in such boring tools are out there in the market you know So basically in terms of deliverables This sort of as developing a helper character probably looks like a character character sheet So there's a picture of the character in different positions.

1:54:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's sort of things they say the sort of things they don't say Like really like pencil on paper And with that we would start to build up What it could look like even if it's not as that that developed it Yeah, I don't know how easy it is like if some people are serious and they want to turn the helper off And they could do that But other people who don't really care like it's kind of fun But I don't have to look at beacon.no They they do it like in a way like it is

1:55:00 - A L
  there and it's fun but it doesn't get in your way because it's so on the side you know like of the thing like here's your main task but then here's some things like there but um yeah I'm quite open with it but I guess my main point is like how to differentiate it from other typical compliance tools in the market that are very kind of rectangle-based uh you know type things um but I do think that that yeah that will help us make a standout um so so I think it's kind of like you're saying like in the banking like sector when Mal was saying like you know like there are some really like annoying tools and then like how do you make it easy that you you don't mind using it like even like transferring on wise or transfer wise it's so much more convenient than going into a bank and trying to figure out how to do it right so something like that I would say got it got it so yeah we can can put something something together on that um so in terms of

1:56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the things we need to focus like immediately from these things. What things would you drag into the now?

1:56:10 - A L
  I think the mobile design now is important. I think maybe like email design. I don't think that'll take too long, but I think that's good to have, which might be around the developer, helper character that can also be flown into the email flow, then integrating more fun or character into the experience and information into the experience, I would say integrating information and integrating more fun.  I guess, well, making the forms more friendly, that's kind of the same as integrating fun into it. would say those are kind of similar.

1:56:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Would you? Yeah, they have the same outcome, but they might be different.

1:57:00 - A L
  right so I guess out of those I would say maybe email flows would take it out then because we have an email for them we'll click on the link once like the email is just to get them to click on the link right and once they click on the link it's more likely you keep them to actually use the the thing and and stay there all right so we'll do the emails later or on the next perhaps yeah yeah and the helper character I think is good um whether that's part of the friendly sort of like encouraging people to come in you know uh yeah sorry I got a little bit confused so let's try to uh which ones do you want to on to keep on inside the now box let's say limit to four maybe um yeah I think those four are good okay and which ones would you put on the next box  Maybe the email flow and then develop the helper ones and the email content design And then the later would be the gamification and the onboarding journey.

1:58:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think it's got it Okay, so So what sends out is I think this is very coherent, right? So the first we are really dealing with more Foundational aspects the design needs to work in the mobile We know that we need to find ways of integrating information into the flows and that Influences the design and of course in mobile we are more limited.  So it makes sense to consider that right now Redesigning some aspects of the forms to make them the more friendly and inviting is also very much a design task that could be you know amplified with  helper but doesn't need that to work. We don't need a helper to make the forms more friendly and inviting.  And you can integrate a little bit more fun and character into the experience. This one is a little bit more I'll say undefined because there's not exactly a known winning condition.  But there's ways of thinking about this. This is about animations. This is about sounds it makes. This is about, you know, the language it uses.  We have some space here, right? Then we go back to the more interaction-oriented aspects, which is like the email flows are really important.  The email content is also very important. And all this stuff, you know, learns from what we've done before. So when we integrate more fun and character into the experience, the email flows, even if they don't have a character, they will reflect that up to a point, right?

1:59:55 - A L
  And then with the character, just goes to 11.

1:59:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then later, And I also personally agree with this. The gamification mechanics, it's something we can layer on top of it a little bit afterwards.  And the onboarding journey for first time users I think is also a very powerful thing. To be honest, I would shift this swap disorder.  Yeah, I think that's a great. Yeah, OK, I'll do it that way. OK, so yeah, for the employee portal, that's that's what.

2:00:34 - A L
  I think we are also missing that approved review. needs to be soon, right? Yeah, that needs to be soon as part of the design.  OK, so approval review.

2:00:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we move something from the now to the next to make space for the approval review?

2:00:53 - A L
  Yeah, I think the integrating more fun and experience into the thing can be moved next.

2:01:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is nice because there's clearly a theme for each phase. for the first phase, we're really dealing with getting a working tool.  Everything we have here is about this. The second one is making it exciting. And the second one is making people actually use it.  They stand out to me as the themes of these groups.

2:01:40 - A L
  Yeah, let me see if we've missed something else.

2:01:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You added this stuff, but we understand that probably the ProverView is a subset of the internal employees. Abby, that's what we had for today.  No, I think it's good.

2:02:00 - A L
  It's good to kind of go through this and kind of catch everything around it because we hadn't done this before But what if like you're thinking and timing and also in terms of the review I was talking with Yvonne today, and he wanted to like better understand what you guys are thinking and Yeah, I think you had an updated timeline, but I need to like yeah, what are I guess the next deliverables on those timelines so that Okay, let me check this out So for now what days today today's 19?

2:02:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So right now we are An Going through the flows of the training section Which should be relatively fast and also for the workshop you'll get the Actuals or like suggestions from this workshop either tomorrow or Thursday  for what do you mean by workshop? So this was the workshop, like what we had right now, right? And we just make some drafts of what this could look like in terms of just a very low fidelity, fast enough for us to make decisions on it.  And based on that, we can, you know, flesh it out a little bit better. Do want me to share the screen with you?  can do that. Yeah, maybe we could do that so we can, yeah.

2:03:27 - A L
  Yeah, okay. So share this step, this step.

2:03:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is where we are at the 19th, okay? Yeah. Okay, and the first track, which is components, we are here.  Okay. We have already some stuff commented on Figma. We are pulling it up into a report.

2:03:49 - A L
  Okay, so that will be on the 20th.

2:03:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that'll be on Friday, 22nd.

2:03:53 - A L
  yeah, it's Friday.

2:03:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  on Friday, you get this thing and you also get this, the risk assessment section. The review of 18. Okay.

2:04:07 - A L
  So by this Friday we'll have like the risk assessment and the training comments there.

2:04:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you'll have the training session, the training, the risk assessment, the low fidelity changes or suggestions to the employee portal that we just did.

2:04:29 - A L
  And yeah, that is it. For the employee portal, we'll have something on Friday then. It seems like we'll have something on Friday, not figma screens.  So do we need to set up a meeting on Friday to go through it? Okay. Could make sense, yes.

2:04:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But maybe in that case we use the meeting for all the different things. Yeah, because it looks like several deliverables for Friday.  So maybe we should set up a meeting for that. Okay, let me just, okay, opening my agenda here. Let me put, let me change the time zone for your time zone.  I could do 3 p.m. my time zone, 3 to 4. Time converter per clock, 3 p.m. 3 p.m. for you means 11 a.m.  for us here in Brazil. You can also do earlier if that helps then.

2:05:38 - A L
  I don't know the time change. It's not a bad time for me.

2:05:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's okay.

2:05:47 - A L
  I can also do like 12.30 my time then because it's ideally, yeah, I'd prefer not to have a meeting at 3 to 4 on a Friday.  I don't know if that's, I could do like 12.30.

2:06:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  one to two p.m. One to two p.m. So one to two p.m. I cannot do that time, unfortunately, on Friday.  It could be an hour earlier or is it on a like, no, because yeah, because no, I can't because that's I do train at that time and then I get home need a shower.

2:06:24 - A L
  Okay, three to four then I guess at the time you have three to four would work for me.

2:06:32 - Mau Medeiros
  Yes, I might have a meeting, but it's not confirmed yet. So yeah, let's put that on three p.m.

2:06:41 - A L
  Yeah, so that's 11. Okay, I'll send an invite.

2:06:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, perfect.

2:06:50 - A L
  Okay, that's one. Okay, I'll send it right now.

2:06:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Should I add even and And to the invites, um, just put me on it because I think they'll be traveling, um, maybe Yvonne, um, ends traveling.

2:07:08 - A L
  Okay. Yeah. You just put me on right now. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Perfect. I'll finish that setting this up in a little second.  Okay, Abby. Thank you so much. It's good. Oh, wait, do we need to set up like another like three hour session for another part, like in the future that we should just put in our calendar to hold?

2:07:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or is this like after, you know, this we do, we do the next one would be the next one would be a week from now, a lot to be six.  Okay.

2:07:50 - A L
  Uh, and the other one would be on the six. Oh, it's already pretty tight on the 26th. Um, I might be able to do from three to five like two hours on the on the 26th or two to five 30 like two and a half hours.  don't know if that's enough. You only use two and a half hours so maybe so can you put that in because my calendar is getting packed on on the 26th.  So from could you repeat the time three three to five thirty or three to five. Okay three to five okay forty five on on the 26th yeah workshop okay yeah or maybe on the 27th 25th might be better but yeah do you have a preference or is just just penciled in why don't we pencil in the 26th I might be slightly late because I have to do a talk right before then but otherwise that afternoon is okay otherwise the 26th 25th okay I'll switch it to 25th is that okay maybe

2:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just have more then like a 230 on the time.

2:09:03 - A L
  I just need to confirm if there's something. Let me ask and then email You want you to send it in right now I'll put everything in the email with like bullet points and everything so it makes it yeah Yeah, okay Okay, um Okay, I'll come back to you probably later on today Got it.  Yeah. Okay. All right From our side, I it was very very helpful.

2:09:53 - Mau Medeiros
  We're happy with the process. So it's good Yeah, I think we'll be good.

2:09:59 - A L
  I'll be good to see
