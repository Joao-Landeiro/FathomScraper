0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's when you know you have one, like when your office looks like you're living room, you'll make it.

0:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  and we'll do it with this view, okay? Okay.

0:13 - A L
  Perfect. We were just discussing levels of customization.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  On one level, we let them do anything they want, which is very flexible, but also very dangerous. On the other one, we don't let them do anything at all, which is rigid but safe, right?  And there's probably something in the middle. What I'm thinking for the something in the middle is that maybe the way they do a customized questionnaire is that they need to interact with 45, the people of 45 build the questionnaire, right?  Not the developers, it's not to make you guys crazy, but just like, let's design this thing before leaving you to create questions in the system.  Because to me, this is a little bit like notion. Like you can do anything on notion, but can really make a mess and get lost and give up on it.  All of these tools that are very customizable, they have a high complexity cost. People need to spend time to learn them and people don't spend time to learn them and then people make  systems and then they say that the problem is notion, the problem is not notion.  The problem is that you didn't set up a notion right. So I think that if we give users too much flexibility to create their own forms, like alone on their own, I think we're opening ourselves to this kind of thing.  I think it's useful to allow them to have their own forms, but maybe they don't create their own forms.  We help them do that.

1:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but still, yeah, but still, still.

1:48 - A L
  Yeah, no, I think we should kind of look at it as much as we can, but like maybe if they want to pay a lot of money, then they have the ability to customize it, but they have to go to Yvonne for that.

2:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I avoid it as much as possible just because of scaling will have issues with scaling and I understand this will be for bigger customers only because it's pretty much related only the biggest customers will have their own policies their own opinions and stuff for example telling or they have their own stuff just because they're big and they need to have this but smaller companies won't have opinions usually and won't have nothing to add so I don't expect this to be done by smaller companies but but big but here because I think countries have different rules here right Abby so if we want to also spread to some other countries they might be able to create their own policies or service that are specific to those countries so probably not too much because it's based on the iso methodology which is global yeah the methodology should change though it okay fine then that use case is out of the but but still it's it's the we're going back to the question of small with this a big big company small company  don't care too much they just want to get over with but big companies have people whose job is to do this so they care and they want to have it customized for them.  I don't know, I would really the perfect scenario for the technology side is to not have any logic inside of the forms.  We can always take a look at as an output of a form and what happens to what happened with the form but it's hard to put not hard but yeah it makes things more complex to have logic inside the form.  if this is answered, this is not answered. Also another thing I want to mention if they have custom forms then we cannot do much about it because they can create any form they want and we can hardly know what they created.  That's also important.

3:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And they will create stupid forms. exactly, yeah that's true. And they will start sending people forms for a sign up for the Christmas party.  People get emails from 45 like what Christmas party? And it's not good for the brand I think. So I really, really agree with Ivan on this.  And I think, again, we come to a point of ICP, like, what's the ICP for this? Because they have different technical demands.  And another point I think is maybe a way for us to navigate these complexities. OK, let's say they are a really big company and they want to pay the big bucks and they want to have the power to customize things.  I would consider the idea of a hybrid service, which is, I think we have spoke about this when we had customer success on a previous conversation, Abby.  oh, you are really big. You pay a lot. But we sit with you and we design this thing together.  So we make sure that they even get, like, why go of service? They get their own forms, but they are not free to get their own forms in the wrong way.  Ideally, I still prefer no customization at all. But since the big ones will want some level of customization, let's at least contain the data.  match and do it with them, not just give them the keys to the castle.

5:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's... Oh, well, I don't think customization is necessarily bad. It's just that with customization, I think we should have it.  That's why we're building libraries this way. I think they should be able to change their questions. They should be able to change it, especially I see someone else doing that and big companies.  But I think we should try to not have by default any logic related to those forms and stuff. Later on, like, we can create the processes.  example, data. This is like an example. data is really complex tool. Actually, we need the surface.

5:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's really complex to you.

5:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can customize basically anything you want. And there they have a workflow builder.

5:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, basically, you have...

5:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, I'm sorry.

5:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Somebody can take care of it. Sorry.

5:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, okay. So, basically, you have an old UI where you build the flow. So, you have, you can drag and drop arrows.  You build, okay, from status to do, then you go to complete and so on. This is something that we can have later on so that  companies can customize their ESG processes and compliance processes, but at this point I will try to avoid all that stuff and try to start simple.  This is in the process, you have policies here and then we need to leave some, I will try to be as least restrictive as possible we can be on this form so I think just to pick everyone's use case which is not easy.  So yeah I think we should try that and then later we can add like processes and more settings and more stuff in so that users, advanced users like you said, can customize things and do things in a more advanced way.  Same thing, you can just drag and drop tasks from left to right, but if you want you can dig really deep and set up your issue, your property, your flows, your what goes where, on.  Yeah there's a bunch of stuff and even automation, they have automation so you can set up what happens if I don't know create.  I put one task in done, and the other task is related. I can move both, it automatically moves both of them to done.  So basically, they have really advanced stuff there. So we can have similar things in the future, but I would try to avoid all that now, try to be as open as possible to all our users, and then build on that later again.

7:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. a couple of things we've discussed, just making a quick recap. Right now, we do have individually addressable questions.  We would avoid logic inside of a form. can, you know, after the form is done, we can check those questions, use AI to extract stuff.

7:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  One comment, sorry again to interrupt you, but we can actually, this library we're using, it allows for logic inside of the correct form.  So the logic that it allows is, for example, if the answer on question one is yes show question two in the answer on question one is no show answer three.  So we can have that and that's pretty easy to do to a builder and through UI and everything we don't have to do much but that's all the logic we can have it's contained in the form.  cannot be yeah yeah I can even show you later if you want but it's pretty straightforward sorry okay so please continue.

8:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Intra in instead of form we can have logic but then relating the form to other things is is much more tricky and and brittle and fragile.

8:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  Relating the questions is a specific question inside the form to outside thing is a bit harder and trickier to do but relating form is fine we can still we have a form we can relate it's just it's hard to you know when we say gives form it gives form but what happens when this user comes in and re-overrides gives form with Christmas party form how do we know that they did it or not and and it's not easy so yeah please continue sorry no no understood understood so

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  just doing a quick recap. We do have ways of figuring out individual questions even if we do it like in post-processing.  It doesn't have to be in real time. There's ways of figuring out the individual question and we can extract reports from that later.  We are now more aware of the risks of customization done wrong. We also agree that it's important to give them customization and we've also said that smaller companies will probably have less desire for customization.  I know that there's the AI note taker, but I think this is basically what we've discussed so far, like we export away some pets and then came back to this.  What we're getting at at this point is an understanding of, okay, there's a technical way forward to do this so it is worth to consider  either how a CSRD question relates to an ISO question because if there were no technical way of doing this, this discussion would not make sense.  But there is a technical way, so it makes sense to consider how one regulation, our question from a regulation relates to another regulation.  Okay. So far, are we good? Yeah.

10:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is this, is this a useful discussion?

10:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what's, can I just ask, what's the purpose basically of all this?

10:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  I missed the maybe initial part. So what's the whole purpose of this? Is it related to control for something more than that?  Yes.

10:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Perfect. So this is related to controls, right? And some controls, they can get really cascading, do you have cars?  Yes. What kind of cars? Oh, this kind of cars. How much do you drive with these cars? Oh, do you drive with gasoline or diesel?  And it felt that before we start designing all the controls, we should have like some sort of a basic logic.  that we know that we're not for some and works for all of them right and we were exploring the idea that we are now abandoning of instead of thinking about the form so we would think about individual questions and then put them together in a form but we're abandoning this idea we are going back to the idea of just use the that logic that you just described if you have if you're petrol or diesel or whatever if you you have car yes no question we can have that logic very easily so if you have our first question we said have a car and you say yes then we can show a list of questions and you click no we don't show that list of questions that's pretty easily doable with this library so we can have things like that that's completely fine but the other one that's going goes outside of the form it's a bit more complex got it understood understood okay so that's good we have that mechanic nailed down so let me see yesterday so before I talk too much maybe is the library still being useful no I think it's good and I think it's good for

12:00 - A L
  Yeah, as we plan it, so now that we have an idea, then we should move to the control area or go to the carbon one there.  Okay, so let me share my screen. But also as we go into the carbon one, Yvonne, how is the launch going?  Is there like, I feel like for this part, I don't know if you need to be here if we need to, like, if there's any outside launch.

12:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  We are working on bug fixes and I will try to, I will create a release with bug fixes probably before our meeting at four.  So I'll probably be listening for another like 15 minutes or so and then I'll probably jump out and go do some stuff that I'm working on some bugs.

12:41 - A L
  Yeah, that would be good, yeah, I think that should take priority.

12:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So to make the best use of your time here, do you have specific questions related to carbon reporting, Yvonne?

12:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, not yet.

12:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not that deep into the topic yet.

12:52 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I'll just listen in to get a bit more context for myself and then I'll probably go over it in more details once you have something more.

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, yeah so So yesterday we did this which was just an understanding that everything starts with a goal for instance Carbon carbon reporting that goal as a set of obligations like I need to talk about mobile combustion Waste Use of chill water.  These are just an example and each of these obligations Requires me to collect data on that which could be a form or a question or something that I sent to a third party, right?  or an employee and Then I need to manage the task of That that the collection like oh, I need to know about how much petrol my vehicles Spend but I don't know it myself.  I asked for help for my For the guys that you know lease the cars to us So I just sent him a task.  Hey, please. Let me know about this, right? I need to know the status of that task as compliance officer otherwise  just send things out and people never reply because they have all the things to do and I forget that this was sent out and it's pending, right?  So I should be able to control to know if a task is pending. And then when I get that information, I should have a way of checking that information like a dashboard or report or an email updates.  So the things that are in yellow, darker yellow are things that we are, we have more developed. The things that are in the red are less so.  Okay. So far so good?

14:37 - A L
  Yeah.

14:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And for the carbon, what we discussed yesterday was the distinction between scope one, direct emissions, scope two, indirect emissions of our own, and scope three, indirect via supply chain, which is like the furthest away from us, right?  And we have decided that Stationary combustion, we had good enough clarity on that because it's just about generators. Basically, mobile combustion, we need to understand a little bit more how to do it, but it seems that's possible based on what Ivan told us.  Fugitive emissions is also not extremely clear. Fugitive emissions are like cooling gas from air conditioning, a lubricant from motors and machines, stuff like that.  For office companies, this might not be very relevant. Purchased energy, probably easy to do, chilled water same, heat and steam same, and waste management.  Waste can be a lot of things, so we're also stepping by a little bit on this. Maybe we could select one of these and go deep on it and try to figure out how to do it on controls.  Let me see. this one is good so i think a lot of these are going to be like questions that we need to ask them but they're not going to one person is not going to know them so we're going to have to have a question but then say you have a question and then we need to be able to send it to somebody to answer the question and then it goes into the form so a lot of the controls will be around that right deploy the forms to somebody and then maybe give some advice on who they should go to for some of this organization yeah so i think there's two the way i see it there's two like distant philosophies on this the first one is we allow the compliance officer to send out an instance of the form to be filled in by someone else right which is i think what you described abby and the second philosophy which is a little bit more basic is we just we just keep saving the progress of the forms and if the compliance officer did not  that information, we keep reminding them, this form is incomplete, you need to talk to that person, right? But we don't manage the conversation, not at this stage, at this stage.  And I think basically the decision we need to make now is for the current stage of the platform, what we want to do.  Just tell them that they need to finish the form or manage the whole send-out thing to different partners.

17:25 - A L
  Maybe that's an Ivan question, for it to be of use, it's one is understanding what you need to collect and we're helping with that.  But the main thing is to be able to help them actually collect the information. So I'm little hesitant if we don't do that part because then you're just kind of annoying.  Then what's the difference about them just doing it on email now? What is the use of a digital tool?  Well, they will get some alt or something like this.

17:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  So they put everything in, they'll get more like dashboard overview.

17:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This will be connected into some other stuff.

18:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I see those as benefits here. I agree with you, it's always better to help them do it, but for initial, I'd be better off just them doing it or us helping them do it for the initial customers.  something like that.

18:13 - A L
  Yeah, I guess it's like, like, so I bought a ESG reporting tool my first year. I spent like probably 200,000 ock, so probably 20,000 euro or 30,000 euro.  And it was like that, it was like I gotta gather all this information and then I put it in my tool.  And then I realized I'm like, I don't need to do this. Like I don't need a tool to do this.  I can get an Excel or get an Atlas at the same cost and do it, right? And like kind of lost the functionality because it was like, okay, I learned what I needed to know and then I didn't need to use the tool again, you know?  And so I do think like the workflow part of our thing is like making a streamline fast and easy for people to do it.  Like that's kind of like our... How would you do it?

18:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  Where is the data storage?

18:55 - A L
  I think it's like, it's the same form but either giving different people access to the same form. goes up in their like employee portal, and then they fill it in in their employee portal because they have the same form, you know, kind of like that was supply chain, we're going to have to do that too, like with the supplied ones.  So I think that's what it is. Like, has to be like, you know, Abby and Zanetta, the office manager, doesn't know instead of going and sending a questionnaire every email, let me deploy this questionnaire or this question to one person to have in there, like kind of, you know, yes, she inbox with all the questions that they need to fill in in their employee portal, and then they need to go in and answer it automatically fills in something like that, or they're somehow working on the same, they have access, they get access to the admin portal, and then they have the same same view, and then they get to fill in the questions.

19:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so in that case, for instance, in a form, some questions I can fill in myself, right? And some specific questions that might need help.  Yeah. So if I send the form to someone on the outside. or they'll be all internal.

20:01 - A L
  For controls, it's mainly internal. But it could be like, I guess like, yeah, maybe it's an external. you're like, if you're renting an office space, you might need to be like, I need to understand what is the end of electricity bill.  So I think like we can, I think, yeah. So it could be external, but I think more internal workflow is more important.  I would say if we're gonna have to do it that way, but we will have to learn external flow because if you think about it with like a supplier portal, that will be external stakeholders too.  Like this issue with controls will need to be addressed also with our party management because it's a similar flow to that.  I would say that's fine.

20:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe even think about splitting this into multiple forms then, like maybe each part of the form can be split into separate form, which then can be done by different people depending on the need.  So something like that, that could also be something you can vote.

20:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the compliance officer could send parts of the form, right? Yeah, because.

21:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Currently, it will be a bit hard to allow someone just to edit a section on the form. It could be doable, but it's a bit tricky.  So maybe an easier solution could be split up the carbon reporting form into five different forms.

21:13 - A L
  I don't know, just something.

21:14 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then you can do it all yourself, of course. But you can also do send the form number two and five to Abby and number three and four to John.  And then get the request.

21:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So guys, I'll need to wait for two minutes. I apologize. There's maintenance going on. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, I'll able to jump off.

21:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'm finished.

21:48 - A L
  Okay, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I think if you need me, I can join and answer questions. see you later.  Okay Casper yeah, I brighten I'm just gonna with my daughter I'm just gonna pick up something and then but I'll stay on the line and tell us how comes Yeah, no worries You You  So, we're talking about the blinds officers sending a subformer, yeah, okay, Okay, in the future there's magic.

23:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for now, do we have a way that we want to move forward on that? we know how we would manage the external data collection?

23:56 - A L
  Yeah, well I think for this one maybe we need to do like some kind of exercise with chat to me in terms of like what are like these are the topics we need like right from the Excel you know and then like what questions should somebody ask from an office space environment to be able to get these questions you know and then we can like then we have kind of the breakdown of what we need to collect and we know that Excel that we had from yesterday that's a calculation for it but I don't know what we think so the question now we are because we need to draw this out so that you know Romeo can make a drawing of it so I think we need to figure out what is the best way to start drawing something around this correct I agree I agree so let's let's pick one and even if you don't do it on this session we just you know take them out one by one and we have stationary combustion is probably good enough to start

25:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right. And after that, we could just maybe do purchase energy.

25:09 - A L
  Yeah, flexible. OK.

25:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of stationary combustion, we just learned that yesterday and we've let's see how we can do it.  So let me get a screenshot into this at point five. A bit much better. Elon, where's the... OK, OK, OK.  Yes, compliance map. Controls, there's no control ahead. Opening, just a second. Copy, copy, copy. All right, all right. All right.  Okay, I'm not being able to log in. Maybe change the login for the for the for our app. In our own app, you mean like maybe we have a link for it.

26:37 - A L
  Brighton, are you able to send him the link in the chat? All

27:13 - Brighton
  Sorry, was the cat found, oh, no, sorry.

27:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, thank you. OK, so I'm pasting my credentials. If you can try the organization.

27:39 - Brighton
  So this is the one I'm using.

27:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this the one you have? Oh, no, just a new one. I just sent it.

27:45 - Brighton
  OK.

27:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is not the same. OK, there's no demo. Got it. Oh, perfect. so much okay so we are at home employee i want the admin portal let's go on controls compliance map controls yes open controls perfect okay and let's let's take a screenshot at this okay and i bring it here into mirror okay so we will have some control some some list of controls on here some list of controls down here right control one okay and one of them is about stationary combustion you  is this making sense? Do you see my screen?

29:08 - Brighton
  Yes. Okay, thank you.

29:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first thing on stationary combustion is fuel consumption for on-side generators. So we probably need an explanation. Right?  Maybe some text here. And a button to move ahead. And maybe on this information, it says something like, if you are on a coworking space, check with  Sorry for the terrible handwriting facilities team, okay, something like this. And then the user says, yes, yes, I want to do this, I want to talk about this.  And there's questions, right? So do you have a generator? Yes? No, right? And what's the output of that generator, right?  Probably we will need some sort of information around here. Because most people won't much about this, right? where to find this information and so on.  Yeah, where to find it can be found in the Excel sheet.

31:07 - Brighton
  So it's from the annual invoice of fuel consumption.

31:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which, this one?

31:19 - Brighton
  Yes, but I think this, there's some stuff writing at the site that isn't here.

31:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, can you send me the link again so I can put it here or maybe on Slack, everything's easy.  Okay, thank you. Opening, I could open. very good thank you where did you say I could find this on this thing so in Excel is at the site okay under scopes emissions you click that tab yeah over here okay okay you perfect this is great we can put this text into the into the into the thing very good excellent it's really useful to have the sort of information okay here and then at the end we just have some sort of confirmation like confirm maybe there's a drawing there of a generator there's a number there's a unit and there's a confirm and go back  right? And as I do this, I'm taking back to this thing, to the controls page. This would be a simple way to start collecting the stuff about stationary commons, right?  Does this make sense? Yeah.

33:27 - Brighton
  Okay. So let's go to another one.

33:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Purchased energy. Okay. Okay. So for purchased energy, I understand that we also have information on that, right? Purchased energy.  You can obtain this data from And I know I'm voicing it. OK, very good. And we bring it, just to keep it here, but we'll need it for later.  OK. And this is probably very similar. It's the same kind of thing. OK. But instead of Session Air Combustion, it says, purchased energy.  And when we talk about units of that purchased energy, oh, I was not sharing the right tab, apologies. So we have the country, we have the unit, we have the consumption, and then it calculates this thing, right?  Yeah.

34:55 - Brighton
  Yeah. So you can calculate either by consumption amount or your spending amount. So there's two ways. Okay.

35:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So there's two ways. So we should give them options.

35:10 - Brighton
  Consumption.

35:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Amount. And what was the other one? Apologies. Spending amount.

35:18 - Brighton
  Spending amount.

35:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's probably interesting information we can give them to help them choose. How do you want to do it? Okay.  So let's say you click on consumption. Okay. So if they click on consumption, is that a spreadsheet thing? Yeah.

35:46 - Brighton
  So they can amount, they enter the amount that they consume in kilo, like in whatever you need the one.  Amount.

35:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Unit. Okay. So this is the thing. And this is a drop down menu. Okay, there's an amount, there's an assumption.  Is this making sense? If I'm moving too fast or the handwriting is too perfect? It's okay.

36:16 - Brighton
  Okay.

36:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, and this is it or do they need more information if they go through consumption? That is it. Okay.  And then we have the confirmation which looks a little bit like this, kind of like this, right? But if they go into the spending, they have a different way of doing it, right?  Yeah.

36:41 - Brighton
  So they enter the amount that they spend and the currency. Okay.

36:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, amount spent, which is money, right? Yeah. And the currency. And then it comes into this thing, oh sorry, they also must input what location they are in.

37:19 - Brighton
  Okay.

37:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're in both of them or just the both of them.

37:23 - Brighton
  Okay.

37:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe we can ask them here, so at this stage.

37:30 - Brighton
  Yeah. Location.

37:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. If I want to apply different locations, I would need to do this for each, right? suppose.

37:41 - Brighton
  Yeah.

37:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Location. What's the granularity of location? Do I need to give a country an address? Just the country.

37:52 - Brighton
  So for example, Norway or Iceland. Got it.

37:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's. so it is location country list okay the first thing on the list is always Afghanistan it's never Afghanistan is filling the list but I think I'm only looking at European countries and US yeah okay so this is cool let's make a note on that all right so this flow would allow us to collect purchased energy up to an acceptable level correct yeah okay cool let's do another one so purchased energy is now good enough and we change the color to this thing okay  Which one would you prefer to do now in terms of like just taking things out of the way? Which one would be easier?  Shieldwater maybe? I'm open to your question.

39:11 - Brighton
  Shieldwater just has one input which is the consumption unknown. Okay this is great.

39:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It helps when these things we can get like some quick wins at the stars right? Okay. Shieldwater. Okay and so it's just one input, correct?

39:37 - Brighton
  Yes, just one input and no need location. No location? Yeah.

39:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, information okay let's go and the input is?

39:50 - Brighton
  Consumption amount.

39:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Consumption amount and it's just the amount and again.

40:00 - Brighton
  It is close.

40:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you need it. it's okay. And then after we do that, we also have not the same confirmation, but we have a confirmation.  Yeah.

40:14 - Brighton
  Okay.

40:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll take it out of this thing. I'll bring it here. Okay. So we've now done chilled water as well, which is great.  Chill water is not good enough as well. Cool. Since you've looked at this, okay, let's move on to the next one.  Which one do you think we should do now? I'm not trying to put you on the screen or anything, okay?  Purchase, heat and steam, okay, let's go, yeah, so Purchase, heat and steam, okay, so Purchase, heat and steam, info, let's go, okay, what is asked of people to come again out of the fuel type,  Okay, fuel type.

42:04 - Brighton
  And then the unit and consumption amount.

42:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Amount. Unit. Types. Okay. Okay. Yeah, and that's it.

42:25 - Brighton
  That's it?

42:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is great. Okay, bring it here. Another one. Let's come back to the spreadsheet. put your steam in steam.  Okay, okay. Put enough, put enough. Okay. Waste. How do you feel about waste? Waste.

42:52 - Brighton
  Um, I think it's also quite straightforward. It's just sorting by the different types of ways. Okay, okay.

42:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we can.

43:02 - Brighton
  So let's go, waste, we have the usual introduction of what it is, okay, and then, so I think they must choose what type of waste they produce, so that means they probably have to fuel a few options, so for example, metal, much, organics, how much, paper, how much.

43:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm thinking, let me know if this makes sense, please, that maybe different people at the organization, they know different things about different wastes.  And if we want to send them the form, maybe we should break this waste into different forms, right, so wastes, organic, I don't know.

44:00 - A L
  plus, and then you put the different waste types in, depending if you have the statistics. That's usually how they report on it.

44:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But if I send the form to someone else, they'll have to fill in the whole form, right?

44:10 - Brighton
  Actually, I think for waste, all data comes from one report, which is the waste generation in the company, then all the information should be there.

44:18 - A L
  Sometimes, not necessarily, because I've tried to do this in my last company. Waste is such a it's like for the countries that do it, like in Norway, it's really easy to get the numbers.  For countries like US or India, for example, it's pretty difficult. They just don't like, they don't sort. So it's really hard to find.  So I would almost say by waste type, and then you start out like, these are the different types, either drop down menu, and then they can add the waste, and then there, then they could drop, and then you could be like add another type if they happen to have it, then it's like paper, and then they can add it next to it.  So then it goes, it goes that way.

44:55 - Brighton
  Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense. So let me...

45:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's experiment with a different way, okay? Yeah, I need to take a call.

45:10 - Brighton
  Okay, should I hold?

45:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's just draft something and when Abby comes, we show. So there's different kinds of waste or types.

45:31 - Brighton
  Right?

45:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And by clicking, so this A, this is B. Brighton, we haven't been like super properly introduced, but super free to like interrupt question.

45:50 - Brighton
  I'm very open to those things, okay?

45:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it helps me. it's so free.

45:56 - Brighton
  Okay.

45:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's say A kind of waste is what? Organic waste? Yeah, organic waste.

46:03 - Brighton
  Okay, let's say organic.

46:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so there's questions related to organic, right?

46:10 - Brighton
  The questions is the same for all. So it's just the unit. So is it like kilograms or tons and the consumption amount?  Okay, okay.

46:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Okay, so the easiest way to do this, okay, I understand you. I understand your point. I think I was over-engineering this thing.  How many kinds of waste are there? Seven.

46:38 - Brighton
  Seven, okay. Yeah.

46:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So times seven. There's kind. There's amount. There's unit. And maybe there's info or where to find it, right? And we do this a few times.  My question here is maybe perhaps a more technical question is, let's say, so I'm thinking about the scenario, Abby explained that I should be able to send this to people to fill it in, right?  But I know how to fill in organic waste, but I have no idea how to fill in light pollution.  I have no idea if this matters, but just go with me. If I send this form to a person that will fill in the organic waste, I guess they'll see the answers for the other ways.

47:39 - Brighton
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

47:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The same thing, yes, most likely, but not necessarily. Yeah, but I guess it depends on, there's a couple of things that are important here.  For instance, so this is kind of a technical question. We should leave it for Ivan, because as I like Okay That's a waste And answers et cetera, okay I'm sorry, there's 21 types of wheeze not seven Okay, um, is it 21 in total or 21 in like seven groups times three?

49:29 - Brighton
  21 in total. So why there's so many is for example under Organics, we have seven there and then under matter we have four kinds.

49:38 - A L
  There's like Aluminium cans and four for combustion landfill So but the likelihood I don't wonder if we're gonna we might need to simplify this for offices because The likelihood of them having that detailed waste is really Very low.  So it's almost like we might go by the heading or something We need to look at that and I do think we did we get bright  one plane from one of the customers like their actual like wasted like we can look at like a wasted voice or something like how they collected the information you can see how at least one country has organized it but I feel like they're not going to get to that much people for it.

50:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah yeah so in that case I would add a comment or observation box because if we have a it's a bit of a lazy thing but it's really really flexible if we have users that are super sophisticated and we just give them three types of wastes and they're like oh yeah but I collect more stuff than this we can then just type it in in the box but we're not overwhelming the users that just want like the three main types of waste and it's a simple thing that allows a lot of flexibility for the future and to collect data on what people are writing on it and stuff like that I don't know if I explain myself in the best way was it clear yes okay so for all for uh given that this 21  types of waste are they it's always the same way we we note them down like kind amounts all the same all the same perfect very good um okay this is is good uh good enough okay here here okay let's zoom out there's only two one was mobile combustion which was the vehicles and the other one was fugitive emissions that from what i understand was not like a big deal for most office things correct we can do it for sure it's just a matter of prioritizing where we do we begin i would begin with mobile combustion yeah i don't think that the fugitive emissions is going to be all that relevant and it's not going to be material anyways for these office companies i think it's okay so again can we move into mobile combustion yeah so um

52:00 - Brighton
  to electricity where you can compute it based on the fuel consumption or the car type thing.

52:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I love when we can do stuff like this, like we reuse a pattern that we've noticed before. So the pattern was this pattern, right?  Okay. So I'll change some things when I copy it, but it's basically this. Okay. Okay. Copy. And about the question, it cleans up, basically this thing is making some sense.  I'm sorry. Okay. So, okay, tell me more about the mobile thing.

52:52 - Brighton
  So if let's say we do fuel consumption, they first have to choose what type of fuel use. It's like a drop-down menu and then the unit and the consumption amount.

53:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, we had that somewhere. Oh, it's the same thing here. Yeah. For the purchase, here is D. Okay, so it's this.  Is it here? Okay. So, fuel type amount unit. Yeah. And this is if they go by consumption, correct?

53:31 - Brighton
  If they go by spending.

53:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is car type.

53:37 - Brighton
  So, they choose the car that they use. So, maybe like a small petrol or a small diesel car.

53:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just to be sure, I'm not sure. So, when we click on spending, you need to pick up the car.  Oh, sorry.

53:51 - Brighton
  It's not by spending. It's by the car type.

53:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, how many kilometers? So, sorry. So, is it the consumption or car type? Car type. OK. Car type. OK.  And now, when we're talking about car types, so there's types of, I suppose there's types, right?

54:15 - Brighton
  Yeah.

54:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK.

54:19 - Brighton
  And what else? And I think this is by how many kilometers you drive in each car? So there's another dropdown for kilometers or pass.km or torn.km and consumption or distance driven.

54:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe we need also an amount of cars, right? I might have like three lorries, two sedans.

54:47 - A L
  Yeah, you're going to have to track the type of cars because you might have like two electric cars, one lithium, so one thing.

54:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think we need like an intermediate thing, which oh, no, maybe we don't. just come here and we have like a box here like add car right and when I when I say the car I need to say the amount of miles correct it's not it's not miles it's the amount of driven yeah so it's like usually it's not to have been in a year or a certain time period of reporting I heard parts of it but not not everything come again it's usually like the amount of kilometers in a reporting period that they will need to report so does that mean like let's say okay this is really relevant because it affects every other question let's say I'm filling this report in February and I'm very late okay maybe this report should have been filled in in October right yeah you have to put the time period of the invoice of where you're getting your

56:00 - A L
  data.

56:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  all of them need the time period? Yeah, when it was collected.

56:05 - A L
  So you're usually collecting for a period, so you have to make sure that the data, like if you're ever audited in future, they're going to check one time, like, you know, where's the invoice from, right?

56:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, okay, so there's two questions here. It's not complex, but just to make sure, do we need to add for every other flow, would we need to add like the invoice period?

56:30 - A L
  Yeah, or at least the dates that the information is from, right? Like you can assume it's in that period, like, you know, we're collecting information from January to December, so you put in, but you should have a documentation as an audit trail, right?  So it's like you're getting the numbers in, but they will want to see the actual documentation of where you got it to see to make sure you put it in the right year.  So we have to have a place to be able to collect the data that we're asking for.

56:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for all of them, we should at least give the option of a look at document. Yes, an evidence of everything.  Evidence. Is it multiple things or just one thing?

57:12 - A L
  Open multiple, because each of these need to be evidence ideally, right?

57:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, but what I mean is, let's say I'm just, I'm filling in purchased energy, right? And I put in the information manually, I just type it in, right?  But there's, from my understanding, what you're saying is that maybe we should have like a box here, like add the document, right?  Where you upload like the invoice, right? I can see this being very useful. My question is, maybe they should be able to upload several documents, not just one document.

57:45 - A L
  They might need to because it might be multiple, I think. Yeah, it might be multiple that they need to do.  Okay. Okay, so this is good.

57:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there might be multiple ones.

58:00 - A L
  Okay.

58:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this also mentioned if there's documents. Okay. Cool. So, and we also need to give them the option of option to type in the period of data section.  Oh, right. Okay. So, good. Okay, back to cars, back to cars. So, on the cars, we can add a car and we have types of cars and then we add amount driven.  We have a unit and then we can keep adding cars, right? Add car. And at the end, we have like a table of cars, let's say.  Correct? So, but this is actually the same thing also for the fuel type as a fuel type could also consider different kind of different cars, right?

59:13 - Brighton
  Yeah, but they are, I think it should be different few types, right? Because if let's say I have three petrol vehicles, I can just input the total amount of petrol use, right?  I don't need to do it for like individual cars.

59:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's much easier, Nobody will know like the, yeah, I agree. I agree. It's really a edge case, people that would have that much of a granular information.  So car type comes here. And then we have something that says, okay, let's go, okay, let's go. And this takes us to confirmation, right?  Yeah. And the confirmation and we should have also the period. And the documents I Would say add the documents outside of the cars Because maybe I've documents that don't relate to a specific car It's just like a thing like a contract that covers all cars everything.  You should just have a document thing Document okay, and then we take us to the confirmation And the confirmation is also a little bit more complex than the first ones because it might need to account for For car types Display Method of collection, okay, okay Good enough So we now have also for the mobile combustion  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fugitive emissions we just say, let's not do this for now.

1:01:12 - A L
  What are fugitive emissions exactly, Brayton?

1:01:15 - Brighton
  Fugitive emissions are the refrigerant leakage and fire suppressants. So you look at it through the company's air conditioning maintenance and fire suppression system.

1:01:24 - A L
  Now, that would be very hard for an average company too.

1:01:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so waste is the only one that it's about indirect supply chain?

1:01:48 - A L
  Yeah, there is if you want to add like, and maybe we could do more research into this Brighton, but under waste, you can maybe add a box around.  around flights, like business flights, because that is another common one, but that one's a little bit hard to get, because you know like a lot of small companies, they don't have like, if you had one travel agency, it would be very easy, right, because then you could collect all of them, but if you just go and like go to Expedia or whatever, book one, it's very hard to get all of the employees' data to be able to see what their carbon calculation is, you know, unless it could be as part of the control, you know, employees like, you know, register your flights, you know, as part of the control, and then they're to collect how many flights have happened, but that's a kind of a manual process too, but business flights is often like a scope 3 one that could be done, but it's not, it's not as easy, because waste is like, you know, do you have a digital that says it or not, right?  It doesn't impact every employee having to fill in their waste usage. So, but it is an interesting one, because that is an output of like travel, right, is a big carbon.  Calculator, probably more than the waste in that sense.

1:03:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, I see your point. my intuition on this tells me that just intuition is not even female intuition, so it's not good, but can I say these things now?  Sorry, the point, what I'm thinking, I agree with you that this is relevant and maybe one of the things that we could use like a philosophy as a philosophy for Fortify is there's so many things you could collect, right?  And we're trying to keep this simple. And some companies, they have public roadmaps. Let me see if I can find an example of this.  Maybe you know how I mean. So, Tydeco. Tydeco.com, okay. Nope. I need to look out. A lot of people might pull.

1:04:00 - A L
  from their accounting system you know they can look at flight or tagged at flights and then they just grab it and they would do and then do a base analysis on it.

1:04:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay okay so just a second.

1:04:14 - A L
  But if not it depends on each system because each accounting system doesn't necessarily pack it right and then it's also hard I don't know right and we'd have to look into the spend calculation on air travel because it might be more from one country to the next like you you like gas and Ukraine it you if you fly past Ukraine might be more less than like plus I don't know but there's probably some kind of calculation that we didn't have figure out.  Or could you calculate by like kilometers? And maybe or it could be based off of like yeah how much the flight is but then like problem with the accounting system the accounting only looks at the cost right it's like a flight from Portugal to Brazil will be like it's 600 euro 800 euro where it doesn't in the accounting system it's not going to say how  actual kilometer to this, right? So then you're like, oh, it's gonna have to manually back it. So that's why a lot of people like to spend the base one, because it's like, okay, let's just, it's not perfect, but it's a lot easier than having to go through each possibility and like calculate.

1:05:13 - Brighton
  Yeah.

1:05:14 - A L
  Yeah.

1:05:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, so let's go, this is a little bit of a tour. But basically, something that we see some companies doing now is just asking people what they want, and people vote on it, right?

1:05:26 - A L
  Yeah.

1:05:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we could do that like, Hey, guys, right now, we don't collect information on flights. How many of you want to collect information on flights?  And then we see that nobody wants to collect information on flights, but everybody wants like some AI synthesizing thing.  So we focus on that, right? there are like systems to run this public road maps thing. We don't need to build it from scratch.  Anyway, so back to the Miro board. So fugitive emissions for now, we don't do it, waste, let's keep only the waste on  Is that it?

1:06:02 - Brighton
  Actually, how about cloud carbon emissions? Are we going to add that in?

1:06:08 - A L
  Yeah, from the cloud.

1:06:11 - Brighton
  Well, yeah, that's a different part.

1:06:13 - A L
  Like, yes. And that's another question. Yeah, we've kind of separated the carbon emissions of the office and then carbon emissions of the cloud, but technically it could maybe all be under the same control.  Do you know what I mean? And look at waste, you know, like waste to water cloud. know, cloud could be its own one.  That's scope three, right? Yeah.

1:06:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just thinking, just thinking. So Brighton, we do have like some forms for cloud usage. Yeah, Brighton has made those forms.

1:06:51 - A L
  Like, at least the question that you... So I've seen it.

1:06:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So your question, Brighton, is where do they go? Are they part of controls or?

1:07:02 - A L
  Yeah, it's definitely part of controls, but my thing is how I was thinking in my head, it's carbon reporting for the office go into this section, carbon reporting for the cloud go into this section.  But technically it's all in the office, so maybe they should all go together in the same section. I think it's less confusing.

1:07:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a little bit counter-intuitive, I think. But if you put things inside of things, usually people get a little bit lost.  I'll just keep them out like clouds here on its own, and office also on its own.

1:07:40 - A L
  Office is all the other stuff, because all of that like chilled water, lease, vehicles, whatever is office, purchase, energy, emission.  I called it office, like.

1:07:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh. Okay, so that changes things.

1:08:00 - A L
  out is office, right? But I just kind of like mentally when you do the work, it's like it's a different, not necessarily a different flow, but people think about it differently, right?  They're like, okay, this is your cloud users sitting on AWS. This is what's actually in the office being done by us, right?

1:08:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it, I think it's, yeah, anything could work for sure. What do you prefer, cloud going inside the office or cloud being a peer of office?

1:08:33 - A L
  I think a peer is good because I have a feeling cloud is going to outside office. it's good that it kind of, people are going to see like this is our office emissions and they are cloud emissions and you'll see that cloud is going to be.

1:08:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we have carbon reporting. Within that we have office and then we have cloud stuff. And then within the cloud, it's AWS Google or you know.

1:08:59 - A L
  Yeah.

1:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is kind of the same idea of type of car and so on. Yeah. OK. So what kind of reporting is one type of thing, right?

1:09:14 - A L
  So are there other controls?

1:09:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there are, right?

1:09:19 - A L
  Can you give me examples? There are those forms, those annoying forms, being like environmental, suggestion, whatever form that, what are those forms that he made?  OK, OK.

1:09:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me see, by the way.

1:09:40 - A L
  Yeah, there was another one, asset management. So asset management is another whole big one that we have to do.  Next probably is like, how do you track this? And I think Brighton has created something like that already. Another one is around employee feedback, I call it, like employee feedback and review is what I call it and in within that.  I have document change request, incident investigation, and employee improvement. Those are kind of the three that fit within those.  And those are mainly forms that you need to deploy within the control section that they need to fill in.  So those aren't as complicated, but you don't really need to do anything but review the forms. And when they come in, you need to review it.  But then... So what's the last one?

1:10:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Employee suggestion improvement.

1:10:29 - A L
  So they can take improvements. For improvement suggestions on environmental, you need to be gathered. Got it.

1:10:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the asset management is also probably another one, right? Yeah, after process.

1:10:45 - A L
  I think Brighton has mapped out an asset manager process. It's pretty much like you need to register your devices that you have.  You have to have a process for managing them and then also recycling them when they're in abuse.

1:11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So basically what I'm thinking is for instance So this this is cascading right there's carbon reporting inside of carbon reporting there's office inside of the office There's chilled water inside of chilled water.  There's Consumption amount unit and confirmation and also documents, right? So There's not a problem just making sure that we all see Okay let's go, let's go.  I'll give the minute, but I'll join you there. I'll join you there
