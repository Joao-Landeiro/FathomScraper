0:00 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  if the control forms for governance have all been done already, like is it ready for testing?

0:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let's open the figure on that one. Okay, as far as I understand right now that's more of a development thing rather than a design thing, but we can try to figure that out.

0:33 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Yeah, because Abby asked me to test for max, but I'm not sure if it was ready. Got it.

0:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's figure this one together. I'm going to share my screen here. Okay. Okay. Then on the platform, let's come to controls and You must go through governance.  So these are the controls that have been developed, coded in, I am not sure. I don't know if the development team has… let me send you this link.  So I'll send it to you on Slack, on your personal… Okay, so first question. Are these the right names, the right controls?  We can do it quickly. Let's check this out. I'm taking a screenshot. I'm coming to Figma. I'm dropping this screenshot on Figma.  Okay, so these are the… in the Figma, in the controls page, we have listed all the controls to be developed, right?  So… And if there's a source or no source, there's a source, right? And the basic idea behind this is that it's easy for the development team to translate a list of questions into the design.  So they've allowed us to focus the design on other things. let's see. Conflict of interest declaration. Yes, there's conflict of interest declaration here.  And so the name is correct. Let's open them later afterwards. Ethics survey. From our perspective, we thought there wasn't one, but here on the thing, there is one.  let's see.

2:48 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  For ethics survey, I send the survey template into the Slack content channel. Okay.

2:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I understand that the translation from your content into the developer I think it's not something that we know we're tracking here on the design side.  So instead of us just going one by one, are there specific ones that you want to check so we can use the rest of the time for the other things?  I can check that myself.

3:14 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Okay, perfect.

3:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Romeo has created an entire flow for asset management, which is a part of controls, right? There's one specific kind of controls, which is asset management.  I'm opening the link. Do we have the Fathom here? Yes, Fathom is here. Opening the link. yes, here we are on controls.  Romeo, if you don't mind, I'll just introduce this. You can interact with me at any time. Okay.

3:51 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay.

3:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So asset management starts with a table of all the assets. Okay. and there's the asset ID, asset name, asset type, asset status, asset owner, when that asset was added and some actions.  Question, is Abby on the call or she'll join us?

4:15 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, no.

4:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I think you should wait for her because we are having a validation conversation and it's important that she's here.  So while she's not here, we can use this to give more context to Brighton and help her with some questions.  Do you have other questions on your mind, Brighton?

4:36 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Not for now.

4:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you. So in that case, we will see this for sure on this call. Let's just wait for Abby on it, otherwise we'll have to read it.  So I'm going to backtrack and use this time together to check if the controller are all right. Once Abby joins, we change that, go back to it.  conf Conflict interest declaration is good. Addict Survey is good. Conflict of interest is not the same thing as Conflict of interest declaration, right?  Let's come and see. Conflict of interest declaration view. That's how it looks. Let me duplicate this app. Let's close it.  And then our governance. And then Conflict of Interest, where it's not here. So let's see them side by side.

5:43 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Are they the same thing? Yeah, so just now I asked that, was going to ask the development team later because all the forms have the same content.  So I wasn't sure if they were done with it already or this is the final one. So if I open expenses.

6:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so it changes the name but doesn't change this. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we'll need to check that with them.  I gotta say that I suspect that this is really not difficult to do. It's just that they've been focusing on other more leverage tasks.  But I'll leave that for them to give context on. I see your point. Okay.

6:32 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay.

6:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi, so Romeo. Come again.

6:40 - A L
  Yeah, no, go on. I'm going to be driving, but I have the phone.

6:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. So Romeo has done the asset management, which is part of controls. So when people join, I'm sharing.  my screen when people join they see a table of all the assets right and we can filter the table it's usual and not really add right they can add there's a button to add the new assets and it's also possible to change the owner of the asset to edit some information on the asset change the status of the asset so if we try to add a new assets there's a few questions first asset type a name for the asset description quantity of that asset so we could just instead of add one by one we could buy 10 computers and just you know do it in one go let it because eventually you would need to assign each asset to a person right so yeah but we are separating the creation of the asset and the assignment yeah because it's separate like yeah because it's  Okay that's more than I thought. Okay so then there's date of acquisition with this kind of an assumption on our side document uploads notes and observations right and then we add the assets and there's an ID that is generated automatically for that asset okay yeah I think this is question that we should tag more blue okay and then we confirm the asset is created and that's it and then we can also edit the asset of course because there's a life cycle to the asset right we can edit any of the information on the asset because people make mistakes  we should be able to correct them.

9:02 - A L
  And there's also a view of the history of assets changes, right?

9:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So details are changed, owners that change, stuff like that. And the status, right? There's three status, basically. There's functional, not functional, and obsolete, and not functional, and broken beyond repair.  And we can change the owner is the same sort of interface as other interfaces where we put an email.  So we change the owner. We say, oh, put that email in for the new owner. And then we confirm the transfer.  And if we confirm, the owner is updated. This is the kind of thing, because it interacts with other people, that there's a lot of room to get really granular and really detailed on this.  so that we have a working for now.

9:54 - A L
  I think that's more than enough, I think, than that. I think it's its idea. Eventually the thing is like if you put in 10 mice, you know, 10 mouses, like, you know, that like, it's more like, yeah, are we going to be like an asset management for all every type of advice, or only the ones that have been given to employees that you need to get back, right?  So I think that's the thing I was thinking. It's like, we don't even need to put all 10 mouses.  like, only when you could have 10 mouses somewhere, but then you just want to deploy one of the 10 mouses, that's when you use the system because you want to be able to track devices to get back.  Otherwise, all of them are in your storage, you know what I mean?

10:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But what happens if somebody leaves the company and their computer sits and assigned for two weeks? Unassigned for two weeks?

10:44 - A L
  Yeah, nobody's using that.

10:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So like, I leave the company and my computer...

10:48 - A L
  But it should be stored in a centralized locker with IT. If it's not being assigned to anybody, if it's...  Okay, but from our perspective, what do we call that?

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it unassigned?

11:02 - A L
  Yeah, I guess it's unassigned or like yeah, or I guess my thing is like when do we want to use this?  Do we want to use this as a full asset management including for IT where their stuff is like? That's where I think we're at the Rolls Royce of like then you have to be like every time like an asset comes in We put it into our tool and we become the asset management tool for that Or do we want to just be like we are the tracking tool once it's deployed in case you don't want to deploy nine of the Mises you only want to deploy one that you're able to track and find out where that mouse is So you can get it back when it's time at you know save money for the employee, right?  Like that's the Toyota version kind of thinking there No, I understand but I In my mind, there's like a journey My thing is like I don't like but maybe I just because I'm driving I don't see an unfortunately Sorry about that like my point is I don't end up necessarily wanting to be like the asset management like  It become like a maybe it's not that much different technically and everything right like I don't know but it's like in my head it was born like when you deploy it and like do that rather than like Let's let's categorize every kind of app that the company has you know like Then we're going into Rolls Royce territory But maybe it's just as simple to do those rights given the technology is not that difficult anyway So we might as well put it in place.  Do you know what I mean? Mm-hmm.

12:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

12:26 - A L
  Yeah Yeah From a development perspective perspective, is like basic Database being like add things to database remove things Okay, let's get you have 10 keyboards right like am I when I am I going to register them at one time at 10 You know or do I you know and that you're saying like yes do that because that makes it faster But then does that mean in our system automatically we break out 10 lines so that we can individually assign those or  You need to reassign when 1.10 is given away. we have that turn to 9 in the system? Or do we deploy it from there?  that starts to get more comfortable. If you never even put in the 10 in the system, you're only putting in the one that has been deployed.  So you don't end up being like, OK, every time I have 10. Or you have to end up fully putting in 10 that haven't been deployed and then deploy it one at a time.  So that's the thing that's like it from the complication.

13:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, understood. I don't know how to solve that, at least right now, because if the thing that is the most important for asset management is the end of life thing for this control, how does the thing?

14:00 - A L
  enter our consciousness, our awareness at the end of life. So, because you were assigned it, right? There's assets that have not been assigned that are sitting in a drawer or sitting somewhere that haven't been given to an employee.  We don't care about those because those haven't been used, that those are like in a drawer somewhere, you know?  And then the ones that have been given out, those are the ones that we care more about and we would track that and when we give them out, we would be like, Shao has this.  So, when he leaves the company, we would say, okay, all of that is there. I understand that.

14:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I understand the use case. But the thing is, we know that if a thing is not assigned to anyone, yes, it will be on the locker or for the IT team, that's for sure.  But I'll do it. Oh, that we can trust the information on the table if we only put things that are assigned, right?  But you wouldn't give a question even if you documented everything in there either.

15:13 - A L
  Somebody can just be like, okay, I got 10 bar and they put mine in. It's the same issue.

15:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a slightly different one is lack of information. The other one is wrong information.

15:28 - A L
  So wrong information, there's nothing we can do about that because people can put in the wrong information. What do you want?  It creates more confusion if you're trying to manage all of their assets, the base versus what has been deployed.  So if you put in like, I got 10 keyboards, I don't I know I wouldn't want to manually put in one keyboard keyboard, two keyboard, three keyboard, four.  So you put in 10 keyboards all at once. But that doesn't help you when you're actually because that deployment is only going to be to one person.  And that so then what are you going to do with the rest of the nine? There's a lot of  Do you need to go to two and then it deployed to a person the other one you go back and the reduce it to nine my point Is like I don't it seems like it's more complication Rather than skipping out like having to reduce that nine part having to input that thing and then also just giving it to the person Who who got it you're taking out like several steps in the process and you're making it more like a Toyota So So So the suggestion would be to not give them the the option to add more than one device at the time Yes, or make it very easy if they add more than one device at a time then that splits up to like different roles that then they Oh, of course, of course usually to somebody Of course, of course each line on the table is one different asset We can add multiple assets at the time because that's what people do in the real world But we would not lock that asset into a group

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So each asset would be its own line, yeah, for sure. That's fine because then it doesn't become one line item of 10.

17:08 - A L
  It becomes automatically when you add it, like it will create 10 line items of one in the system. Yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly.

17:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's it. That's precisely. Okay, then, okay, then we're, okay, then we're aligned.

17:22 - A L
  Okay, because I thought it was like you're gonna take one line item of 10 and then it gets really complicated.  Oh, yeah, I agree.

17:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, that would be very interesting. Okay.

17:34 - A L
  Yeah, no, okay, no, sorry about that.

17:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, and then we add those like five lines then lines to the thing and we can edit them. need to give people the option of adding, right?

17:50 - A L
  And we can change the information like the description and so on.

17:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can change the owner, we can change the status, right? The status. We always show the current status, is, for instance, in this example, it's functional.  And we can also show the new status, which is non-functional and obsolete, and non-functional and broken beyond repair. And right now, our understanding is that, yes, in the future, it should be possible to, I don't know, perhaps integrate with other things that are really called e-waste guys, but for now, it doesn't exist.  So yeah, that's it. mean, asset management, it's done.

18:43 - A L
  Perfect. Another request for, like I wanted to discuss on design, but I don't know if you have anything else on your list.

18:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on the review side, this is it. And then there's, we spoke, Romeo and I, we spoke about the third-party management screens that need to be designed.  We'll get on that because that's a priority as we understand it. Yes.

19:18 - A L
  And also I think we... So there... Go ahead.

19:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, Bon. No, we'll need to...

19:28 - A L
  Okay, mine is about a different subject.

19:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we'll need to define... Yeah, we'll need to define...

19:34 - A L
  Okay.

19:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I guess...

19:37 - A L
  Okay, I'll just throw it in because we kept cutting each other off. I think that the third-party comes first in this, and then also the dashboard design.  But I would like... We already have gotten feedback around the policies, procedures, trainings that the policies are a little bit cumbersome in the sense that it's overwhelming.  for companies, one for companies that don't know what they're doing, but also for companies who want to ignore them all because they have their own policies in place already.  You know what I mean? So it's like almost, I feel like we shouldn't have ESG policy tabs. We should just have almost a toggle to a policy page where people could select the policies they want and then bring them to a deployment page, like to a managed page.  You know what I mean? So it's it's not that we start with all the policies. It's more like they could select them and that those the ones that they select go into their deployment.  Am I making any sense? I understand what you mean.

20:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I think we would need to study that.

20:56 - A L
  I mean, I think we should study that a little bit deeper.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to send the basic principle of it. So instead of showing them a list of things they should be doing, just give them the option of deciding on the policy package that they care about, right?  Exactly.

21:11 - A L
  Once they go to a page, all the ES and G policies are listed, or that they can filter out the ones they want, and then they can check them.  And then once they check them, then they go to a place of deployment. So ES and G policies can be all together.  It doesn't need to be kind of separate that. It's more like, I want to be able to see all the policies that are there that if I wanted to use them, I could use them.  But then if not, I want to upload my own policy. And I just want to go there because it's kind of, yeah, we know.  But as I said, there's other things that go first. And maybe we should just say, now we can have another section where we kind of try to outline this more that there's bit of a Romeo to drop.  Yeah, because that's a, yeah, let's think about that. But that's piece of it.

21:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I haven't.

22:00 - A L
  No, that's fine, and I'm right and I know you're working on the crafts and stuff with dashboards You can send them up, but do you want to work on kind of example drawing something?  I just finished those actually I can send them into the slack now Okay, but do you want to like share your screen to show them or do you want to look at it Uh, I could share my screen so So Brighton has pulled up all the dashboard ones and she's also made example graphs for them So I think it's more than for Romeo to when he gets to it actually, you know make the design for that And do you want to share Brighton your screen a little bit more and explain a little more Yeah, can you see this?

22:57 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  no. Yes, we see your screen.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, can you see the controls graph? I see trend, I think we will see what you see. We see a trend line of gifts received versus offers.

23:11 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Yeah, so I think I thought of a few graphs to make for each of our control forms. So for example, for government officials, yeah, I just came up with a few graphs like gifts received versus gift offered by man or like comparison of the payments by different business units, just like a few graphics so that it's easier for the people to see like all the different data points.  and then for this one before.

23:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, can we avoid doing business units right now because we said that we'll kick them out. Is it possible to just have some other groupings for now before we figure out business units per country?  Yeah, countries five, yeah.

23:55 - A L
  Okay, we could just do it per country or yeah, business unit. we're going to have to figure that out by or by people but but even like I guess yeah I agree is enough or do you but do you do need um no I I need design I need design I need this as a graph in the UI which chart goes where yeah I mean we can't decide we just need to put it in place we have some design for some graphs or if I'm not mistaken so then it's more um yeah so then then Romeo then you could do you kind of is this helpful for you I guess Romeo is more like taking the designs as I'll also I guess for you is like taking the designs and then putting them into like taking these graphs and putting them into like a dashboard type thing that you would extend in there uh yeah Romeo just said the okay reaction emotion so yes okay so then yeah so  Can you send this in the design chat, right? So that it is more, I think the first priority is third-party management.  Or no, it's a Controls-Evan, I can't remember. Controls-E. Controls, yeah, Controls-E, then third-party.

25:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  I have lots of questions, but I have a last one. Maybe the most important one is if you see my message in the design channel, and I don't remember the conclusion about cargo and emission results.  What's the conclusion there?

25:27 - A L
  Where will it be? Where will it live?

25:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Will it live on the dashboard or somewhere else, a separate page? I think it should live on the dashboard, but that's a good question.

25:38 - A L
  I think all of the results should be on the dashboard after you've deployed it. that's a bit too much stuff on the dashboard over time.

25:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  For now, it's fine because we have nothing there yet, but over time, it will be really, really lots of stuff, right?  So I just need to know where we should put, what should we do with the results of the carbon emission report.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  suggestion, putting it on the dashboard, but I agree that we need to find a new model of a page that shows like, uh, synthesized results within their section.

26:14 - A L
  I don't think we have a way of doing this right now.

26:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, but for now, would put it on the dashboard, uh, even though it's not ideal for long-term, the long-term news.

26:26 - A L
  Okay. Yeah. But I think as long as like, we're able to pull some of these, um, so that people will see how controls works then I think.  And the question is, does it make sense? Yeah, I guess development-wise. Where are you guys, Yvonne, now on development?  What are you working on? Controls? So we are, we are today, we have, uh, yeah, controls, yeah, controls.

26:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  We basically car for reporting, but today we also were testing with the G controls and found some bugs, so we fixed them today.  And I think we can release the G on Monday morning every week. want to do it right afternoon because it's that timing so we can so I would I will write your message after we release after we fix everything on test and maybe you can test a bit over the weekend and check if the content is all right and and so on so that we can do it Monday morning for for three and then when do you think you will be done um based off of the carbon emissions and what you see like when do you think you will be done probably we'll need next week the my biggest concern is if I see correctly asset management is not actually a control it's that's part of e but it's not standard control it's completely separate flow of pages so that will require a bit more time and that's probably it will take at least the next week maybe even a bit more yeah okay so you don't think you'll be able to start on third party until the week after then or do you think you'll be able to start on third I think so yeah so the control management, I thought it was just a form, of course, it now makes sense to me that  this list of all the assets you have in the company. So if you have a page with the table of assets like so in the design and it's nothing complex, but we just need to do it.  So it will take a couple of days to do it. That's it. Okay.

28:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because asset management is not the one-time thing, right? Because the thing you keep doing is a user.

28:19 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would say it's completely different than all other controls we have. It is the control, but it's completely different.  You don't deploy it, don't do the stuff to it. It's just like a list of assets that you assign or not assign this from what I understood.  yeah. Yeah. I think at least for this version, think yes.

28:37 - A L
  I think eventually it could be like you can send a message to the employee portal and be like, confirm this or let's just use it for this.  But okay. then by E will be by the end of next week, and then third party would start soon after.  So we have next week to finalize third party and maybe, and third party based on what you see, Yvonne and our discussions because we've built a lot of third-party already, right?  a third party should be pretty quickish. I guess it depends on how, when we see it from Romeo, I guess, what?  Yeah. agree.

29:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  I to remind myself of our discussion. I know we had a long one, but we didn't conclude much in the end.  We concluded a couple of things, but yeah, it will be too much of work, but there will still be some adjustments to do, especially on the design side.  yeah.

29:24 - A L
  Then I'm just thinking, okay, E controls next week, the week after third party management and possibly dashboard week after, right?  Yeah.

29:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Dashboard needs to come before third party.

29:36 - A L
  yeah.

29:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Well, so the week after, I think the dashboards will be, they should be pretty straightforward again, because we have the graphs already designed, and we have it implemented.  So we just need to do the backup and put everything in place. But let's see. So it will still take a day or something like that.  So it's a lot of things that don't take much, but it's a day plus day plus day, then the week is over.  So it's over. Yeah. Okay.

30:02 - A L
  Okay. Um, then, okay, I'm just thinking I'm just planning for next week then. Um, because then, in terms of, um, either updates to our current one, it's off the feedback like the one I just mentioned, along with the risk assessment, probably needs to be mapped out.  And then we're almost done with that. But then next week is actually not a good week for me because I have all afternoon workshop from Wednesday through Friday.  But I don't know if you have time on Tuesday. can move a meeting.

30:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But let me just, uh, before, so risk assessment right now is, uh, the set of instructions that we show people when they add a new, uh, third party, right?  No, no, I'm talking about that.

30:53 - A L
  That's risk assessment for third party. I'm talking about the full risk assessment box itself, like the box of risk  assessment that's on top of policies, procedures, training. And we do have some existing content in there. But again, it's like the third party one where we need to kind of map it out and say, does this make sense?  Is that something...

31:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So are people asking for a risk assessment? Have we promised people risk assessment for now? Yeah.

31:23 - A L
  And this is where we could also bring into because two companies are in the risk assessment process and they want it done.  Risk assessment is actually the... How do I say, you're supposed to start with a risk assessment for it. it is kind of a key thing.  I feel like if we have third party and risk assessment, then we can almost stop and we can manually do the reporting and the audit trail or something.  It doesn't need to be as much. Then those main boxes would be the main boxes of the tool that we can go to market with.  So I think it is important whether it's next week, we can skip next week and then do it the week after because they're not actually going to because Romeo is going to be busy on this and that uh and they're not going to look at it probably until a week after like in two weeks right at the development for doesn't start for two weeks so is it like better that we can also just skip you and me like talking about these things because there's enough work for Romeo and Ebon and then we do the week after you know I think the first thing is that historically and this is not because of this team historically it's very difficult to predict the development time for things because you pull things from one side and other things show up so I would refrain from like this very tight deadlines like we are assuming that the development and Ebon if you think I'm out of line please enter but it's it's risky to assume that everything will go according to plan and then we have a meeting with the clients I think it takes away a lot of marching for for corrections and things like that

33:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I agree.

33:01 - A L
  So it's more like next week, like right now you and I don't have any meetings set up next week.  I really would do with a time difference unless we want to get up early or maybe I could also do evening actually.  Never mind. I could do evening like my time is more like what should we do? need to have a meeting next week to have it ready so that we have something you know ready so that Romeo when he's done with his thing will have that ready so that that will be ready for even or do we feel like there's enough on the list from both sides already that we can skip a week you know and then and then and then do week because Romeo and even already more than busy enough you know I'm saying it's more like like I think there's a few things that can be like that whole policy thing and that feedback that we're getting like the designs and the PDF like I think that needs to be fixed after we get through that part and then the whole risk management needs will probably take some time like third party where we really need to think and say maybe talk to some customers and say like is this what they they really want but we need to have an opinion first before we go to them which could be like  Next week we have an opinion on it and then the following week we go to them and and get the opinion But that means but I actually I'm not as worried now job because I realized I could work in the evening So it's more like there's not that much time in my week that can actually Fit in the schedule, but if my evening is still your working hours, so I can do like 8 p.m My time or something and then like do that.  So it's more like then we pick a day and then Like maybe Wednesday or Monday evening and then talk about these it's just more about your availability Okay, so that's good.

34:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's good that we have the availability I'm very open to that conversation. I Suggest that can we make it That the development team also participates in that discussion because I feel that the Third-party management and the risk risk assessment they have some similarities with what just happened with asset management  which is, it feels like it's a form, but it's not a form. It's the beginning of a new task that people keep on doing.  And that is complex to fit in the current architecture. So if we could have this discussion from the three perspectives, like product design and technology, I think we might be saving ourselves a lot of headaches.

35:25 - A L
  So I guess it's more like, Ivan, like given the time, I have a Tuesday at two, which I can move a meeting, or I can do evening, then that would mean you have to do evening, or I could do morning, but then Xiao, that would mean morning for you.  so it's like, I don't know, Ivan, I could do evening on Monday or Wednesday, you know? Like...

35:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  What's evening? What's, what times, what time are we looking at?

35:50 - A L
  Like, for me, it's always better after like 7.30, 8.00, because I just like kids activities and different things, but I don't know what time is that to use now.  we four hours different? like 8 p.m. my time is what time your time okay 8 p.m.

36:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  your time is 4 4 o'clock my time so yeah I could also do I could also do 9 p.m.  or we can do like 5 p.m. like right it's not ideal because kids activity between 5 and 7 so it's more like it so I might be able to do 7 38 yeah I can okay so either we need to make a decision on scheduling time but before we do does it make sense this just one is for you even does it make sense to participate in the discussion of how to create the risk assessment thing I mean yes I mean yes yes it does yeah okay so I'll share my screen in my screen there it shows the two time zones on my calendar so you can see your time zone and my time zone in the same screen so here on the side you see central european time and this is brazilian time so you can guide your own agenda through this thing  Right. Is it the decent zoom level? Yeah, I think so.

37:07 - A L
  Yeah, so for me it's just because I have like next week, like yeah, like after lunch, every day I'm kind of busy, except for Tuesday I might be able to move a meeting at 2 to 3 to enable it during the day if we want.  don't know if you're free 2 to 3 on Tuesday. Otherwise I could do evening on Monday and Wednesday and I'm pretty flexible on Monday and Wednesday because it's in the evening.  it's more like even like you don't have kids even so you I don't know maybe eight or nine is not a good time for you like or maybe it is because then you could go out to dinner and then come back you know like or like you know what you prefer.

37:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, let's let's let's try to just give me your time this week and I'll I'll try to adjust if I can.  Yeah, that's it. So which are your time slots the ones that we see are your free time slots or there's there's something else.  No, no, all my whole life is here so if it's free, it's okay.

38:00 - A L
  Okay, good.

38:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then Abby, which of these blocks of free time works for you best?

38:09 - A L
  Well, let me see, we have a 2, like if you have a 230 free, on Xiao on Tuesday, is that 230, you're that comfort thing, NZ on the 11th?  Oh, or is, you have this one? This is Tuesday. You have a white block that ends at 230, right?  Your time, or my time, that white block underneath? Your time is this thing? Creating framework session one, that ends at 230, our time, right?  Correct, yes.

38:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, no, no, no, no, no.

38:39 - A L
  No, no, no.

38:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, This is my time, this is your time. So, this thing ends at 6 p.m., your time.

38:46 - A L
  your time, okay. So, your 2 p.m.

38:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  is free, is not free.

38:51 - A L
  And then if you, okay, 8 a.m., then you're 9 a.m., yeah. And then Monday, I'm at a client office.  So yeah, it would be evening, I guess, then it looks like you have something in the evening on that 10th, right?  Is that that product thing? That that one? don't know what time is that to 10 p.m.

39:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, this is like 11 your time.

39:13 - A L
  Okay, so that okay, so that'd be after so we can either. So I think it's more like even on Monday or Wednesday is when I have free Tuesday.  I have like this dinner. So it's more like I don't know what your workout activity is or like I don't know.

39:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Wednesday sounds a bit better for me and we can do Wednesday at I don't know, seven, eight or let's try to do it that way.  Okay, Wednesday at eight.

39:37 - A L
  Could that be work from eight to nine on Wednesday? Yeah. Okay, let's put that in then and then we'll talk about risk assessment and then maybe that the new like update on the content feedback and that so we can add that to the line.  Yeah. So this is about risk assessment. Yeah, risk assessment and then I don't know maybe do you want to discuss the dashboard or do you think you have enough on the dashboard based on what you saw with Brighton?  I think Romeo said it's okay. we don't have time for more than one discussion. Yeah, let's just do risk assessment then just to make sure we get that started and we know what questions we need to ask our customers.  So, okay, then I think we're aligned and I think this is good. So it's it's exciting to see it come together.  But um, okay. Yeah, thank you. Then have a good weekend. Anything else for?

40:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hope you have a funnier weekend than us.

40:40 - A L
  It's so ugly here. But um, but yes. Because, okay, everything good then. Okay.

40:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  All right. Thanks for your happen. It looks good.

40:50 - A L
  All right. Thanks.
