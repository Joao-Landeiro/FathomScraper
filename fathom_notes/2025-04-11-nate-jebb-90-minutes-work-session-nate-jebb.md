0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  um yeah i mean that's uh that's a good question so i don't know how for how long have we been you know connected but basically right now there's two main things so the first one besides client work so the first one is the the book and i got infected by the the book bug i guess okay i read that i don't know if you've read it the right useful books yeah yeah yeah have you yeah it's really good i i really i thought it was really good yeah and i've been writing for for a bit but not in a single place so i like you know what and i think this is actually exactly i mean eating your own dog food right you know exactly what this means just writing things down and the forcing function of figuring out what you think and now you have to think about it and the other thing is the podcast which is i'm i'm now on the editing face  this for the first season. Oh, cool. But I'm not, I don't think I'm going to be a podcast guy.  I don't think I'll ever like a continuous podcast. It's just that I wanted to do the experience of having done a season.  And do know that I think that that figure that fact about, you know, most podcasts, they, um, they stop after maybe one episode or something.  Like if you put out like 10 episodes, you are on the top 1% of podcast. so I was like, yeah, I want to get on the top 1% of podcast.  You know that with this season, because I won't get 10 episodes out of it. But anyway, so that's it.  It's hard work though, isn't it?

1:42 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Like I, I've tried in the past to do a sort of podcast and like, it was way more effort than I thought it was going to be.  But I was like, I don't really enjoy doing it. I didn't enjoy making it. So I like, I don't see the point to do that.

1:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah, and I was taking a pic at your profile. So

2:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  been then like broadcast stuff right radio tv yeah so like yeah yeah i did i did a lot of that sort of stuff like made some short films i was appeared on other people's radio show so i was basically just okay that's like i don't want the pressure of doing it myself so i'll just come on and talk to you uh on yours um which which was fun i think do know what i think it is i think more than anything it's like the editing of it i don't mind turning up and speaking to someone on the call that's the best bit right but it's the the editing stuff i think if i was going to do a podcast i'd have to outsource that i think i don't think i'd be able to do it just oh oh yeah i know i'm i'm i'm a newbie at this so i have spoken at podcasts maybe one once or twice but i've never you know produced one and i'm using riverside and it's pretty it's pretty easy to edit it in like a good enough way cool like it takes you can i don't know if you've seen it maybe you've seen it but you could just select

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  text that you say I don't want this and then it gets up that's that that's section oh so it's like editing a word document rather yes yes oh yeah that seems easier okay it's it's yeah it's like yesterday I had literally maybe 45 minutes and I had a few recordings that I needed to edit and I was waiting for my wife I opened my computer on like a cafe and I was like yeah let's see what I can do and just my first time using it uh like to edit yeah and because you know it records the separate tracks and so on like it's really like just remove all the amps and amps and you know and unlike it's like pretty good so yeah I mean yeah with that that plus like AI now probably even easier right like and I guess eventually all of that you just guys like look here's what I want hey I'll just be like yeah here you go cool yeah  Yeah So those are the things what about you? You have the ship emojis.

4:06 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  They've done the ship 30 for 30 thing No, I haven't no the ship is because so I Came up with this concept that I call having a flagship framework So that's my nice as I could find to a flagship What I should really do is have the flag a flag and a ship, but I feel like that's too many emojis going on then Yeah, so I mean I What can I say?  What's happening to me? I recently launched that new offer around the flagship framework thing and That was based on so says it's my second offer of launch this year my first offer I launched in January was Sorry, I was trying to open your your LinkedIn business  uh close the thing so it's easier okay tell me more about it uh yeah so that so in january i launched an offer that i called niche builder and the idea was i would work with solos mostly consultants and coaches that sort of people to to help them build their own niche and it was essentially i don't know if you're familiar with like nick bennett um who does this kind of thing um the name is familiar linked in you might have seen him around but like he so it it was basically a one-to-one coaching where oh yeah i would you know nick yeah um yeah one-to-one coaching where i would basically work with them to figure out okay well you know who are your target clients what's the problem are you solving for them how are you solving it differently like all the different components of essentially positioning them in the market but what was  The was, after that first round of clients, I obviously spoke to them all as like a debrief, like got feedback and so on, and they're all kind of like, it was really valuable, but I think the niche part puts people off, like a few of them were like, like, they were like, I almost didn't do it because I didn't want to niche down.  And what I meant by niche was different to what the common accepted word means. I mean, like most people see it as pick a very target client and stick with that, and that's it.  Whereas I was seeing it more as a holistic, like, well, it's that combination of what you do, who you do it for, the problem you solve by all these different things.  So it made sense in my head. mean, some people's heads, but not everyone's head.

6:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

6:44 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So I was like, okay, well, maybe I should drop the niche part, because if that's confusing people or putting people off, I'll drop that.  But then the other interesting thing that came out of it was, everyone said the most valuable thing was that they were all essentially selling their thinking, right?  They're all experts in their fields, and so they were selling how they think, but found it really hard to explain how they think and their approach to work and so on to people.  And that's when I started thinking, and part of what we did was come up with a framework and be like, okay, well, maybe this is your approach, this is where you go out and communicate, this is what you can own as a concept.  And I was like, well, maybe I should just focus on that. If that's the most valuable thing that all of those clients get out of it, then actually in a way, I could narrow my focus further into that and sort of be very specific, I suppose, around the problem of self.  So this new offer is around that instead. And I think you do framework related stuff, is that right? it's all a method.

7:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, no, it's kind of there. I'll touch on that. I'm not skipping the question, but just to give a little bit of context.  So. Well, it's funny that this thing of helping solo experts because, you know, very interesting people to talk to.  Also in my experience, maybe it has been different for you. Relatively difficult to sell them stuff because they have a high sense of agency.  They're like, oh, I'm not curious person. I can learn this thing. I can try to apply it. Yeah. And I love the conversations.  Now, I'm yeah, I'm not sure I should be selling to these guys. And also because it's very easy for me to trick myself and like, oh, I'm having like business, it is not a business development conversation.  It's just a cool conversation. So, yeah, I empathize with that. And it's funny, the thing you've mentioned about niche, what it means to you, what it means to other people, I think I have the same thing, same thing with the workshop.  Mm. And I've been trying to, Find other ways that you don't need three lines of text to talk about it.  Yeah, and it's really difficult and Because I come at it from the perspective of someone that you know has done workshop as a Participating in workshops as seen audited workshop.  So for me, it's very clear of course, which is so funny It's exactly what our clients complain about right?  They are too cool to see the thing and and then you go out into the world and see What other people are calling workshops and it's like oh, it's not the same thing They did they think this is a workshop, but this is not a workshop So to me they are funny in this in this box that is not the same But that's useful information to have right.  Yeah, so I really really empathize is more than empathize I know actually what it feels like like you think I think it means something, but for them It means something else.  Yeah, and it's not the first time that this happens in my career You know visual graphic recording, visual recording at conferences when people draw out, so I used to do that and which was you know great practice for translating things but here in Brazil a lot of people would call that visual facilitation but it's not really facilitation it's just you know harvesting gathering and whenever when I tried to you know put the correct names in my website and so on nobody would come and then eventually I put like keynote cartoon cartoons which is not the thing I mean I felt so geeky about it and yes yes that's exactly what it won't it's like oh my god and so yeah I know I know that feeling so back to your question yeah the framework yeah so what I've what I've realized is maybe we have these in common I don't is that I was looking for what to put on my shingle right  what should I say. And the commonalities were always like being between things and translating things from one audience to the other.  But also the workshops like working with people and some problems together. but where I think these two things connect like your thing and my thing is that they both begin with your client's way of doing things, right?  Their implicit expertise must be made explicit. And so visual frameworks, it's something that I think it comes natural to me.  I really like to nerd out on that kind of thing and so on. Also design and so on. And what I've realized is that even the workshops oftentimes they have this the visual framework can be the backbone of the workshop, right?  Yeah. And perhaps the most famous example is the Business Model Canvas, is a kind of, it's not really a framework, but you understand what I mean.

12:06 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah, think just what, like, it's, again, it's hard to find the right word for what these things are. But I think, like, I am using framework very loosely in the sense that what you've just that Canvas would count, I think, for me as a framework, it's like, well, it is a way of thinking, right, like, it is a thing.  In that sense, it's very much a framework, right?

12:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it plays things in that way. Did I answer your question? I went on a bit of a...

12:32 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah, yeah, so it sounds like you're, I mean, maybe this is a good test of words, but you're communicating what you're doing.  It sounds to me, my understanding there is that, like, you're helping someone, like, who is, I know, an expert, like a consultant or something, essentially, like, take that expertise and turn it into a workshop that they will run through with their clients.  that right? Yeah.

12:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, cool.

12:58 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  OK, makes sense. That's what I would...

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  follow workshop too so I don't I don't know why there's confusion around that because like if I if I was running a workshop with a client that's what I'd be doing but yeah but yeah no I'm glad it works no it's a cool idea though like how did you what did that you they got you into doing that um I've told this story myself so many times so I I'm not sure like what's the real version but this is how I remember it I had I had just quit a job I had so I had worked as an independent consulting before and it was very much like that João was a service kind of thing like maybe your friends understand what you do and you say I think I know what to do with like I think this is very early stage kind of indie consulting so I did I did that for a while and eventually I felt like oh my career is very illegible people don't understand what  And I need to put some label that some people understand what it is. And then I got into project management.  This was right around the lockdowns and the pandemic, which is just a stroke of luck. I didn't plan for that.  And so during the whole pandemic, I was working like full-time employees on. eventually I found myself working with spreadsheets and credit models.  I'm like, I'm back with numbers. It's like liability for the company, for me to be doing these things. And I thought, okay, I'm going back to the my indie thing.  And when I decided on that, I kind of thought, let's just pick it up where I left it. But the world had changed.  I think 2023 was a very difficult year for indie consultants. Yeah, everybody reacts the same way. Everybody's like, yep.  Exactly the first year I was back into into that into that and I was like, okay So I need to be more specific about what I do Yeah, and I was and I experimented with with a bunch of things But eventually I was like I think the place where I have the most confidence is this intersection of expertise and workshops Because I've been doing that kind of thing Before I did it for my wife.  She has a company on consulting That is a different thing So I saw firsthand like oh, I'm good at this like translating this fake thing into an experience that clients can buy so that's how I came into it, but I Made the first approach and I did it in the wrong way I was just talking about workshops and maybe other facilitators were finding that interesting But I was not really addressing my ICP.  Okay. Yeah, and then eventually You know, I started to do more customer interviews, which is the one thing that everybody knows they should be doing but they always progress in it  So I did that and that was very informative. I was like, ah, okay. Okay. Now I have the language of How they think about this.  Yeah, and that was really useful very useful and Then work start to pick up a bit more still not where I would like to be To be to be clear, but I mean it's at least not people understand what it is and works where it comes in and so on but and and Yeah, basically I wanted an intersection where I felt confidence.  Yeah, and This was a very important thing. I was like, I'm good at workshops, but I'm not world-class and The internet does not run on a normal distribution in it runs on a power distribution So if you want to stand out, you need to be really good at one specific thing Yeah, and I was like, I need to I need a Venn diagram where there's not a lot of people and that's how I Like I like I

17:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  It's interesting because like I've always been very I've always put lots of work into workshops that I've ran where it's like actually there's a very solid structure it's quite logical from ones that you're almost like a flowcharty kind of yeah like I that's how I think is very logically and and I think what's interesting is having been in other people's workshops you know maybe like I don't know as part I've been in a project or or I've seen the aftermath of people's workshops it's it's often just a mess different like post-its all over the place you know I get a mirror board or whatever it's like I'm looking it's like I don't know what it is there's no structure to it and I think it's a real big problem because I think it weakens the concept of workshops in the first place like I've done well a workshop is insanely valuable but I think there's a lot of people that kind of just they think they're doing a workshop but really it's just a call like this basically just basically just an unstructured loosely structured interview almost  is really what they're doing and it's not the same thing. So I there's definitely a need for it. I guess part of the difficulty you might have is that people think that they've already got a good one.  It's the same with all the sorts of stuff I do, right? It's always hard to convince someone that they need something when they already think they've got it.  you know, that's just life is supposed to be.

18:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. And that's also, I think you've nailed it really well and that there's a whole set of people have had different experience with workshops and the kind of workshops I really like to do.  I think they are more appealing to people that are in problem-solving mode. Yeah. So a little bit more structured, really like critical, are we getting somewhere, something out of this and so on.  for a lot of people, their experiences with workshops were things that maybe HR may didn't do. which were cringey as hell.  And that just tainted the whole idea of workshops for them. And actually, this is, OK, so this is something that might be holding me back, don't know.  So it's not the facilitator archetype, funny glasses, patterned shirts, something like that. And maybe Peter Kidd kind of vibes.  Yeah, OK. And I've always, like when I'm among facilitators, I always tend to feel like the squarist guy. And when I'm around, you know, technical people, I tend to feel like the funny courtkeepers.  So I'm always like in between worlds. And one of the things is that in some whole facilitation world, the ecosystem, the industry.  Facilitation industrial complex. Um, there's a lot of that, you know, just follow trust the process be happy collaboration is good for its own sake and so on.  Yeah, I do not agree with that at all. Yeah, some people suck at collaborating.

20:14 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  They should not be participating in everything, just participating But this is the thing that maybe I should be saying more of life because I'm I was just about to say that's exactly the kind of thing that you should be posting really though that's really because it's a it's slightly funny anyway because that's really quite funny I explained that which is obviously a good thing and not everyone is but you are but also like it's it's kind of flipping perceived was the one actually, this is bad advice, but everyone thinks it's good advice.  That's quite interesting right you've got a clear kind of angle on that a clear point of view so I always say to like, people like I think the more  you can rant about your chosen topic. This is the better it is. So you don't want to necessarily rant all the time.  But like, even if it makes you angry, I think that's a good sign. And so if you're getting all worked up, like, oh, well, you know, that's, that's awful advice.

21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's just nonsense.

21:17 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  That's a good thing. That should fuel you a bit.

21:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think so. Yeah. No, thank you for saying that I need to send meaning for us. But yeah, and I it's so funny.  And I think that's also probably something you see with your clients as well. Like, sometimes it's staring them in the face and it's like, Oh, absolutely.

21:37 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  You know that Jack Nicholson gives where he goes like, it's exactly why it's like before before I started, my offer now is very much coach driven and model.  But before this year, everything was basically more consultative. And what I've realized after like five years or so can  I was like, I'm really not, I'm really just coaching them through it anyway. Joining like I, I can't come in and be like, here's the answer because they'll be like, no, that's not right.  Yeah. If I come in and kind of just subtly guide them to think they've come up with the answer, then they're like, yeah, this is genius.  I mean, I could have told you this after five minutes, but you wouldn't have believed me.

22:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like, yeah, we had to go on this long one road to get there.

22:24 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  And I think it occurred to me that most consulting really is just coaching, you know, unless you are coming in and giving them an answer that they couldn't get on their own, then maybe you could say that's consulting.  But I think nowadays it's quite rare, especially when it's like their business and a fundamental business. It's like, well, they know their business better than I do.

22:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joining.

22:44 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So it's like, it's, and it's like you say, it's those things. Like often there is an obvious answer. It's just they have to get to it themselves.  That's the difficult part, I suppose. Yeah, but yeah, it's interesting, I think.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I agree very much with you on this and I think that's also kind of a zeitgeist thing. But are you familiar with David Meister for types of consultants?

23:11 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  No, I don't think so.

23:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's a 2x2, right? And on one hand you have low degree of customization and the other one you have high degree of customization and the other one you have low client contact and high client contact, right?  Yeah. So I'll probably screw it up by talking to you about this. basically you have four archetypes. One is the nurse, the other is a brain surgeon.  So the brain surgeon is like low contact, high customization, I think. Okay. I think that's it. So they just arrive and they fix your brain and they leave, right?  Yeah. And then you have the high contact, high customization, which is the therapist. Okay, yeah. Which I like I know you're you're you're training in psychology.

24:04 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So I think the coaching and the therapy they're not the same thing, but Like the point where I often describe it as a bit of therapy anyway, because you know often often that first session is just them ranting against Okay, cool.  We'll start properly next week. Shall we?

24:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Dumping, right? Yeah And there's a third one I can't remember, but it's useful because then you're like, oh, what kind of relationship as a consultant I'm having with this and to your point.  I also feel that you know It's not that the world is more complex now. It's just just that we see it, right?  the connections are more obvious and It's not possible anymore. Just pretend that things are simple because it's just It's very easy to shoot that they are and and for that, I think you need to really work I've been using this expression a lot.  I like it like shoulder to shoulder cooler. And I think coaching is really good for that, right? Or at least the tools of coaching.  So I fully agree with you. Like, it's not about prescribe and diagnose and prescribe is like guiding them through it.  Yeah.

25:14 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  And I think, I think to add to that, you know, because it's really good point that it's like, I quite like your point about it's not more complex than it was before.  It's just, we can see the complexity more before. What's interesting about that is that I think that's also why we had this drive towards specialism and becoming expert in your particular field because I guess it's now way more of a well, they used to be that you could kind of bury your head in the sand and go, yeah, I can do all of this stuff.  It's fine. Because that complexity is more visible. like, oh, yeah, crap, I can't do all of this stuff. Like I'm not, there's no expert in all of this.  should just pick my lane and stay in it. And I think that's, I think it's nicer. I mean, I think there's a nicer ecosystem of of third party.  People like us, consultants, coaches, advisors, whatever they are, in that it used to be that everyone was kind of in competition with each other But actually specialization helps that not be the case.  It's actually really good at our individual things And we can refer work to each other because I actually big each other up because you know We're in slightly different territories, but that might overlap in parts, but that's a good thing I mean, it's like it it means I Don't have to be like oh no go away.  I'm convinced of you It's like oh you do something slightly different to me And so actually my clients could benefit from your service or yours could better than mine or if I if I know of someone that needs Your help I can send them that way.  It's not like it. It's I Think the ecosystem of consultants is stronger because of that fully agree. Yeah There we go, that's could be a podcast episode We can do it.

26:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, you know like in a way, I think that Well, I have forgotten about this, but that's very true.  Because I remember when I was trying to like, am I a real workshop guide? Like my wife, she thinks like, that's too limiting.  I shouldn't just introduce myself as a workshop guide. And I mean, she has a successful business. it's like, it's difficult for me to say, hey, everybody on the internet is talking about this.  Yeah, but I see that. But I still really, to me, makes a lot of sense still. But there's another thing to your point, which is like, I don't think I come across as a threat to most people I find.  So the whole thing like, maybe we serve similar markets, but in different ways. It's a completely different conversation. And I think at the start, when I was less confident about this, I was like, yeah, but maybe I can help them with positioning or maybe I can help them with.  No, and you can, in a sense, because you're clever and you can figure things out and so on. But.

28:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  But at the same time You don't accumulate like highly specialized knowledge so I think I would Maybe it's like an imposter syndrome thing But I think if I was putting a situation where I was like out of a comfort zone and like I wasn't an expert in that I'd be like I'm not comfortable Charging people for this I've not the kind of person that could just sell anything someone is like I'm only gonna be confident enough to do that if I know that it's gonna be good It's actually valuable because otherwise I'm like I don't I don't want to take you money and like scam you do I mean it's Obviously, I can't you know some people Probably do and that's fine each to their own but Yeah, I think there's definitely benefits I mean even with us two as an example, know after learning more about what you do I was like, well, actually there's probably a lot of scope to pass my clients on to you because  Actually, I don't, I don't help them deliver that framework, do you know what Like, let's say they come up with their own like business canvas thing is an example.  sure that that would be like, if they were then like, oh, yeah, now I need that needs to be at the center of my client delivery.  It's like, yeah, it does, but that's not really my remit. Like, that's kind of like, I can get advice them on stuff.  Sure. But like, it's not like I'm going to build that work, help them build that workshop. But actually, you could.  And so it's total sense of me to go, Oh, here you go. I'm going to use this guy. He's going to build that with you if you want him to sort of thing.  Like, I think there's a lot of overlap in a, in a good way. And I think, I think it's just like I say, that's the ecosystem, right?  That just opens up all those different avenues.

29:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And are you like, are you natural? I don't know, are we, are we for time? I've got a call at half, well, in half an hour.

29:55 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So.

29:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I do have a few, a few more minutes. Okay, so for me, this whole scarcity abundance mindset, like my natural tendency is towards the scarcity.  I really have to very consciously think about the abundance. Is this the same thing for you?

30:18 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah, I think so to a certain extent. I think it depends as well. think it switches depending on how much work I have at a time.  If I'm happy with the amount of work I've got, then it's only switches. There's loads of stuff out there.  It's all good.

30:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

30:33 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  I'm like, oh, where's that next client coming from? It's like, anyone be a client? Like, it's just like, I'll just grab you a framework and they're like, what are you talking about?  So I think it does, it shifts. I don't think it's ever like a static thing. I would say I am probably all actually naturally more on the optimistic side.  No, that's good. It comes to that kind of thing, which is good. I agree. It's very valuable because it means that when  is there a slog? I'm very much able to distance myself and go, oh, you know what, it's fine, it'll work out.  We're looking to, I don't remember mentioning the message we sent to each other, but I'm looking to move house, and it'll involve selling this one, buying another one, and all that rigmarole.  the other day, we went to look around on me and my wife, and we don't really know what our budget is yet.  We saw this house, really liked it, and I was like, why don't we put an offer in? And she was like, well, we don't know if we could afford it.  It's like, oh, we'll cross that bridge and we'll get to it. And so I'm like the risk-taker one that's like, well, let's just do it and see what happens.  And she's very much the risk of it. no, we should do all the calculations first and make sure we can afford it.  I don't think you need that balance, and that's why it works for us both between us. But I think left unchecked, I would definitely be in the more risk-taking side.  We'll be back routes by now and just be like, oh, well, never.

32:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We had a good run.

32:03 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So yeah, so I say I'm a risk taker. It makes it sound very cool, but it's not like I'm there jumping off clips or anything.  I mean, so like it is. So I take risks, but kind of slightly tantalizing risks, let's say.

32:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure, for sure. Yeah, because for me, can see. Yeah, I've asked this because I can see the advantages of having a more abundance-centric kind of mindset.  And for me, that doesn't come naturally.

32:32 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  I think if it's not naturally, it's hard though, right? It's hard to build that switch, I suppose, and go against what is not.

32:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. And it's funny because like now I'm getting better. So that's encouraging because I remember like the first.  So there's like the link stage of LinkedIn and just seeing people feeling really impressed. Oh my God, these guys know their .  And then eventually I started setting up calls with people. I got a tight calling kind of like off to the races.  And I started meeting people, which was amazing, very, really interesting. And then I started meeting some people that were super generous in how much they were sharing about their method, right?  Right, For generous. To the point that I was feeling like bad, like, I'm not sure if I'm a client.  Maybe you shouldn't be telling me these stuff. I feel a bit bad. And they're like, no, no, it's good.  It's the way it works. I'm oh, yeah, sure. Wow. And it just took me a while, like less than a year, but more than half a year.  Yeah. And just like leaving with that and then realizing, okay, yeah, yeah, that's how it goes. But it's still like, once, mean, from a background, I'm sure like this is all very obvious.  But like when things get stressed, like I go back to that mode, you know? Yeah, sure. And it's annoying, but it's...  Sometimes it's also encouraging that, you know, as a practice, it is bearing some fruit, but it's just something you need to go through, guess, because I do believe in its power.  think it's worth to get there. That's a thing.

34:13 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  I think it's interesting because I think my whole approach to things like that is very much to almost, maybe this is an unhealthy approach, don't know, but I almost treat it as a game.  It's kind of like, LinkedIn is a good example where, I would not be on LinkedIn if it wasn't for my business.  I don't really enjoy it that much. I don't go for a nice hike or something like this to get some fresh air, but what did make me enjoy it more was seeing it as a bit of a game because I'm quite competitive.  I was like, oh, yeah, I need to up my game page. mean, need more engagement. I need more followers.  And I think That mindset shift has helped me at least, but that's just because I don't like games and I don't like work.  So, yeah, I decided I didn't like work and so I started my own business because that's sensible. Yeah, yeah, that's never heard of it.

35:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the first time I hear about people that do that. Here at home, my wife and I, have an expression in English, which is funny, because we don't speak English at home, but it's just for us, everything is just cooler and shorter in English.  think English, it compresses things like, ah, and the word, sentence is everything is a game, right? And it's funny because, you know, you know exactly what I mean, but you're walking down the street and say, hey, don't step on the...  Dark cobblestones and that that's a game, right? Yeah, you can make thing can make that out of everything and So yesterday to your point we went to an event Like the conference thing.  Yeah, she was a keynote speaker. I got in just as I guess and At some point I was talking to some guys and I don't think I was I don't think I was there ICP and they were at my ICP were just chatting and I remember thinking like yeah Let's see how much I can get people to tell me about their business without me telling anything about my business because I want to practice this You asking questions and so on.  Yeah, and that was fun, right? It just you become genuinely curious I think I'm good at that. I think I'm good at being curious And it's just as a game So I fully agree like it's a powerful idea like every three things as a game.  It's really It's really good.

36:53 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  I think it's like I mean I see sometimes go like the wrong way and like just don't take it a bit seriously It's just a game  You still have to be serious about it, but like, you know, I think if I got works, don't you, but yeah, yeah.

37:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so first thing, I've only conversation. I'm very open to having more of those. And a couple of questions.  So the first one is, because of the book, and I think you have experience on this, you don't have to answer now, but I would like to know if you would be open for me to ask you some questions about like, how you see what you've seen around workshops for the book.  yeah, yeah, I have to help. Because I think I have interesting perspective on that. And it was something else.  Oh, my God. Yeah, it slipped me. I mean, I'm sure you'll remember as soon as we finish this call.

38:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  You can't see it over when you remember, but yeah, let me know about the book thing, whatever is best for you, whether it's a survey or doing another call, whatever is useful.  But yeah, is the book, what's the progress on the book? it written? Is it mostly written?

38:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, I'm on the first draft and maybe 40% in some of the first draft. And my favorite part of the week, just writing it.  Yeah, but it's in a rough, in the sense that you can sense like, oh, on this day, I was happy or inspired on this day.

38:43 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah, yeah, and you can tell it's my style. You need to treat it as a game.

38:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so, yeah, so that's it. And by the way, is there anything because I'd like to be helpful and, you know, is there anything

39:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  maybe I can help you with like with your objectives now is there anything that you're trying to do that you feel I could nothing major springs to mind I mean obviously if you know of anyone that could use my help but yeah nothing that comes to mind immediately but I'm sure I'm sure things will come into my head is there a specific kind of of expert or business that you're trying to you know work with I describe them as I describe them as lots of different things generally like they have to have some level of expertise for me to be really valuable to them right so like can't be someone that's just started yeah yeah like they need to have had a few years experience under the belt had a load of clients and stuff kind of have a pretty good idea of ICP and what they do and so on is  more? How do you then refine that into things? Generally speaking, consultants are pretty good because they literally just sell thinking, which is for the same reason.  I do end up speaking nowadays a lot to people who may be making the transition interesting from like, they might have been a copywriter and have realized that it's AI is government.  And it's like, now we've got to sell some way. Basically, it feels like everyone at some point soon is going to have to sell thinking in some way, even if there's doing involved, they're kind of going to have to sell thinking too, because otherwise it's like, well, what do you bring into a table that AI can't do kind of thing?  so, you know, your office is a good example where you're bringing your expertise and yes, they get a workshop, a tangible thing at the end of it, but like, you're really selling your expertise and thinking you're going to to do that, right?

40:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the actual workshop.

40:58 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  So yeah, anyone really that's tells their thinking, I suppose is how I describe it, is valid for this, so.

41:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I get that, but I mean, is there like, I can give you an example on my side, right?  So for me, what I've been noticing is that I'm trying to work more with agencies, as opposed to experts.  Yeah. And the reasons for me to go down that route is, are related to finding them. For now, now it's easier for me to find them, because they're more visible.  Yeah. And I'm aiming at less than 15 people. I'm still trying to understand a little bit more of the taxonomy of agencies, because that's a very broad category, a lot of different kind of agencies.  And it seems to me that's probably around development, because there's something about wrangling complexity, and I think agencies that develop software know about.  And we changed it to just on.

42:00 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  No, I'm happy to help with that and maybe on another call as well because I prior to working on my for myself, I worked for an agency and we did positioning and messaging for agencies.  So I know the agency kind of landscape quite well. So if you wanted to get any input on that, be a bit to ask.  will, will.

42:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you for offering that. Oh yeah, carry on. I'm using this just as an example, for instance.  Maybe you've noticed that like technical experts, like people that come from engineering. Oh, okay.

42:36 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah. So even yeah, I think it tends, most fairly enough, most of it tends to be on the marketing side and creative side.  And I think that's probably because more that's just my background, I suppose. So I guess I already know their world better, which is helpful.  It doesn't have to be specific to that, so far that does tell to be the pattern and then coach wise it tends to be like you know business coach executive coach that kind of thing.  It's generally always you know B2B as well obviously but yeah I'd say if you're looking for like a subsection then marketing is probably the biggest one in terms of best suits.  Yeah.

43:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I own expertise I suppose. That's a level of granularity. Like I'm not a some sort of kingmaker I don't know that many people but this is this is helpful in terms of like oh yeah perfect.  Yeah cool. No it sounds good.

43:39 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  Yeah let me know about all the other stuff and questions and so on and yeah we'll chat soon.

43:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll chat soon. This was really thank you for being open to it.

43:50 - Joe Daniels (Joe Daniels)
  No worries at all. Enjoy the rest of your day.

43:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Likewise. Have a nice one. See you. Bye.
