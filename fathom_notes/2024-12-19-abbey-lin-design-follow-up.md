0:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I had a good kind of goodbye meeting with Rui to today, where we're kind of just making sure we had a hand off because I went so quickly and then we just kind of didn't get in touch with people in the years.  And then he gave me that mirror link that I've been working on today that I thought actually interesting because it really fit with what we were discussing yesterday.  And it's also very helpful as I go into the board meeting tomorrow in terms of trying to like be clear on what we're doing.  So you guys can go in and if you guys want to go in and look at it, but I just more helping me kind of so that a  some of the strategies and some of the partnerships that I can also share my screen. Depends on what you want to do today, Jean, because I know this is the last minute, but it was more, I thought this was like kind of seeing my screen.  Like, I kind of tried to map out each of our, the customers, you know, that we have, we have like 11 of them and tried to say like, what are we working on, like E, G, and then in terms of like the business value, like which ones are more important.

1:29 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So you can see like, you know, I think really is a point was like, we have to be careful that we don't get drawn, like we need to understand like, we can't do everything for everybody, right?

1:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So who's the most important that we want to do and listen to that's going to drive the most value, you know, globally, for the company.  So I kind of tried to put these all of our customers in and kind of where I see them, and then what they're working on, like, what do they want, E or G, then, you know, or S, we have one that has an S, and then  I put E plus here because they want like ISO 14067, they want a more advanced E, which is why I put them here because it's going to be higher if we want to get them there but I think it could be high value for them.  And then I have some low hanging fruits that we haven't actually met with but these are the ones I'm hoping we'll sign up for free that we can test on that would be like very, they would allow us to test on them for free and then we get to like mess up with them and like do everything before we deploy on all of them.  So these are the ones here but we haven't signed an agreement with them but I'm fairly confident they're at least hopefully we should be able to fit in because one of them is our investor and then this other one is like a small company that I know.  So I'm hoping these are the ones that they'll sign but um but yeah so I did so I tried to map it which is good because I had a really ugly side before for the board meeting and this one kind of helps map it before and then I also did the same thing with our partnerships because we have different partners  ships that are going on for auditing firms, then consulting firms, and then also sales partners. So it was a kind of a good way to break that up.  And then I tried to start looking at this one, but I didn't totally understand it, so I decided not to continue.  then I was more like trying to plan what to do, do it now, do it next, and then I tried to do some kind of quarterly update too.  yes, so I don't know if Mal and Romeo, I don't know if they're joining because they didn't accept it, but I don't know if we...  No, they're not joining, but we've discussed this internally, it's probably...

3:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yesterday it was mostly a conversation between the three of us, right? Yeah, yeah, I think it's fine with us too.  So there's a question in my mind right now, which is... that your board meeting is tomorrow right? Okay so we planned for this session to be a continuation of yesterday's session but would it be more strategic or more impactful for you to focus on using our time together to prepare for the board meeting?

4:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No I think we could also continue on yesterday because I think we need to clear path in terms of what we're doing and I could also present that to the board meeting being like this is what we're doing so I'm fine continuing yesterday if we can use any of the stuff that Rui gave to help with those discussions I think that that is good to have but it's not needed I think it's more I think it's to be helpful for Yvonne to have a clear plan of what we're doing and then for also for you guys for the design team to get us to the next step I'm like what do we need to do and that could be part of like in Rui's they're like kind of do it now do it next do it when there's their time you know so that could also be a discussion you know if we want to use that

5:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  model here like this one he has like so I was trying to say like you know deployment of policy update the map you know do it now because these can maybe be done quickly and then other ones might take longer like AI and stuff so I but I don't know I'm kind of wide open we could also just continue on with what you're doing so it's whatever yeah cool so um I really like this matrix that you post it you paste it and I think the matrix just makes it really explicit the fact that different people want different things and is what Kui said right and since we need to make things that people want the matrix really has an effect on decisions for the roadmap right so all of these things are kind of connected in a little bit of a linear way and since you've done this exercise which I think it's a useful perspective so considering where we are now  We have these amount of people working on it with these clients or these possible clients ahead of us We have access to these kind of people Looking at this metric matrix.  Does it help you?

6:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Exclude things does it help to prioritize things and send them To the to the network I think I'm I could I share this I can maybe explain where this comes from and I could maybe add PGS where I can add deep prioritization So if If you if you can see my screen like you know again Okay, I wanted revenue right but then one is like a strategic value as in brand alignment and referral potential, right?  so and that's why I put like cognite, you know cognitive it's kind of like I don't know the The the football player in Norway right there like kind of the unicorn like big growth company kind of every  and looks towards it. if we get them on, then it's like we have the quarterback on, you know, that on our art thing.  RDoC is not as well known. They're more series D in the company, but they they are also well known.  They're like series D. So I put that there. I put Zanetta a little bit lower even though they're about the same like size as RDoC.  Is this more because the RDoC guy was like, go ahead, hinge the main stakeholder on deciding whether or not to convert.  Where Zanetta, I don't know if you noticed, is like you're kind of lower on the totem pole on the decision on who's going to make the decision on whether or not they convert.  And that's why we have an additional meeting in January or whatever. So that's why I put it a little bit lower because it might be actually maybe makes more sense here.  Like it might take a little bit longer to get them. That's why I put it lower there. then I put Auker Biomarine because he's also a decision maker and he's really willing to go Lars.  So, yeah, I think that would be good. Streis, I put higher because Streis is also a very good company in that they're a series A company, but they're very kind of global, they're in the UK.  They're also like kind of the up-and-coming quarterback that's in here, and if we're able to get them in like their well-known brand name that we can pick on top of over there.  They also want the S, which we haven't created at all, which is why I put the acquisition effort like to the right of RDoC because it's going to take some work to get the S up and running, but we do need to get the S up and running sooner or later, but that's why I put it there.  Aberdeen Laundry Service, I put that it will be high effort because we they're a little bit more complex. They're not a digital company.  They want the ISO 14.067, which is the next ISO, so we need to create that for them, but it wouldn't be that much different.  It's just very focused on carbon reporting. but it's not the priority right now. But it's high because they would be, they're a UK company.  So I would like maybe even put them a higher is that there would be a global, like, you know, the fact that we can say we have a global company, we're outside of Norway, like that's them and they would, it'd be good to be able to say that.  So these three, I actually put down a little bit lower because these are the ones that have, I put Hedra in the highest because she kind of has her own budget and she can decide whether or not they're gonna move ahead but she does want some tailoring.  Like these don't, like low effort, they don't really have an opinion. You know, they're just like, I want it done.  Where the ones over here will have an opinion on how it's done because they're the subject matter experts, right?  So Awker Horizons, like, and then I put Awker Cardamom Capture the lowest because they just had a merger with a US company.  And so they're like, they have to get like their headquarters probably or like they, it's not confirmed like, you know, that they'll go.  And then Awker Horizons, like. I put like there because if they join, we have an AI project with the awkward solution, which is one of the largest companies in Norway.  Mostaf is helping write the project proposal for this grant. If we were to get the grant, then it would be huge, it'd be like 400,000 euro, and that would allow us to build AI into our solution.  awkward solutions has already agreed to be one of their pilot customers, and customer's awkward horizon might join it. So, if they join, then they would go up to this priority list, but if not, they would stay down here.  And then, Telanor is, we're going down on Telanor, but they're still having Telanor as a name because they're one of the largest companies in Norway.  It's good for our brand name and good for our credibility, like if we have Telanor. So, it's finding that balance, but they are a high effort.  So, we have to decide, are we going to work with them?

10:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, that's kind of how...

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and then these two are low-hanging fruit because they they're small and then they're like 20 people so are there any plans to support Talonor's legacy production environment other than just support it or what's the plan for now yeah I have I was just talking with Frederick this morning Yvonne we're gonna meet in January to discuss what do they actually need and want and it could be that like I'm trying to also get Talonor into their subsidiaries like Talonor amp they're smaller companies so there is a little bit of like Talonor like we just need to kind of manage them a little bit but their last prioritized I would say then moving forward in that sense just keep in mind that we we are building new system without Talonor in mind so the code we split the code base so we have code for Talonor separate now and the code for the new stuff separate it's that way yeah I almost feel like that we can deploy the conflict of interest you know the conflict of interest in our new tool to Talonor I think that

12:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  would be fine. It's just more that policy management.

12:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  don't know what to do with that, and I think we'll have more clarity on that part there.

12:07 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I would say that it will be very complex to keep their custom stuff that we did for them with the new stuff together.  So it would either be better maybe to keep it separate and just have a separate code base for Tellenor for now if it's not too much work and then have everything new and shiny for the all the other ones.  But we can discuss it once we know a bit more details.

12:29 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think that would be fine too.

12:31 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think they're okay with the design that we have right now.

12:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  that's that part on our customer base. And I think our ideal customer would be to kind of this column, low effort, the cost of acquisition would be lower, and then they would have the high business value.  And these are so that when I say low acquisition is like complexity and engagement, right? Onboarding time or supporting them in need.  Like it's a less for these that don't have a strong opinion on it, right, versus these that have a stronger opinion.

13:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So let me just, let me just ask something. I mean, I don't live in Norway, and I've heard about Tallinn or in Accra Solutions, so I'm sure there's like a deal, a big deal, especially over there.  So my, my, I'll kind of think out loud about this, maybe the phrase, you'll help me craft it. But the, the biggest carrot, the biggest incentive for us to chase after these companies is their brand name and having their logo on our stuff, right?  Is this correct? Not totally.

13:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like the only reason Accra Solutions is up high is because of them coming to vouch for us for this AI grant.  If they didn't, then they would be deprioritized, like, because they're too complex and to that. So it's really only because of that there.  If they don't have the AI, then they would be prioritized. Tellenor, because they paid us so much money and will continue to pay us money, a lot more money than probably some of these, I think that's why they're kind of kept in that.  So I would say it's more likely that these would be eventually de-prioritized possibly than... So yeah, so I think it depends on whether or not we get this AI grant.  If we don't get this AI grant, then most likely they will be de-prioritized. Got it, got it.

14:31 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Because if I understand it correctly, there's kind of three different business models right now for Fortify. One is to serve mostly digital companies as a beachhead to start doing more stuff.  The other one is currently acting as a bit of specialized software house for special solutions for Acre and AI and, I don't know, Tellenor.  And then also the third, so. three business models, digital companies as a beach head, a specialized solution for Telenor, and high-risk, high-reward AI project for accurate solutions.  I would say it's kind of like it's of three.

15:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like Telenor, I think it's legacy that we just need to kind of slowly kill. So I think it's actually be like three.  One is more for companies that don't have sustainability or compliance officers. One's here for like, so this is just like, like, you know, through them.  And then the one over here would be more for more for a workflow tool for the people who already know what they're doing.  A workflow tool. And then this AI, the goal of this AI is one is money. But ideally, we need to integrate AI into both of these tools, whether it's like a risk, like we can simplify a lot of our processes instead of having step one, step two, step three.  You could just be like, AI do this and then AI does it. So, yeah, AI, and yeah, so one is legacy and then and then AI to also for for in order to close seed round, if we want to get more internal funding, we have to have AI in our tool, our investor has kind of really said that to be kind of relevant.  People are really only funding AI right now. So the AI is more about building AI into our existing tool.

16:28 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, got it. So given given this our roadmap. What should we tackle first? needs of which companies should we tackle first?  I think it's like the low hanging fruits here and then the focus companies here, I would say, like Cognite.

16:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  These two are these two are kind of Cognite.

16:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think it's kind of our

17:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The reason why we have these two is so we don't mess up on Cognite, if that makes sense. So these are the little sacrificial lambs that we're trying to test on to make sure that this one goes well so that we can use this one and jump on top of them, like, there.  Yeah.

17:15 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Do we have access to Cognite in terms of do we know what they expect from this? Do you know what things they've tried in the past and they didn't like or stuff like that?

17:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. And I could actually bring you to the Cognite one, but the Cognite one I think is also the most simplest because all we want is to pass ISO 14001, and they don't have any kind of, they maybe have one like policy, but they don't have anything.  So they have like, they have nothing and they, they just want to pass. So if we're able to pass 14001, whether it's using our tool or some parts of it on offline, they will be happy, whereas these are a little bit harder because like, you know, occur horizons like this part of the tool, huge array likes this part of the tool, know, occur carbon wants this part, you  Oh, so they're quite clear in what they want. They just want to pass the ISO.

18:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  then these two also want to pass, I think, the ISO.

18:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we can test it with them and then go there. And I think in terms of scalability, I feel like there's more.  We haven't tested the market as much, but I feel like there's actually more companies like here there. I agree.  I agree.

18:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I tend to assume that not only the acquisition cost is lower for those, but also the procurement processes are probably simpler.  And the decisions are probably quicker. And they have less, because they are more recent companies probably, legacy systems. The middle problem is really scary to me because it feels like there are some stories about big brand name clients stringing along.

19:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  on small companies how if you build these I'll use it and then it's like a really single point yeah I can see that happening with these middle ones this one the reason why it's in the middle more because we have to build the s if they we only had g then they would be probably less because they would just follow the g process that we have but I agree I'm a little bit worried about these two especially I think I think for her she would buy it these two I think might be stringing us along and just learning and think it's fun on the way and then this one also might be that direction too in the last conversation he seemed like it wasn't as clear but they have more if we're able to say we have a UK based company that's just outside of Norway that helps a lot just for more credibility we're not just like a tool for Norway we're a tool that works internationally so that's why I put them as high value there but if we were to get like a bunch of younger companies from the UK or from oh yeah yeah yeah then we can totally like switch them out yeah then we can like deprioritize them but right now so

20:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think this is like a moving map, right?

20:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  if they offer Horizon joins the AI one, then we prioritize them a little bit more because if we have two companies in our application, it's more likely you're win versus one company.  So it's like, you know, and I'm trying to get Telenoor to join it, but I'm not sure that they will, but yeah, so that's kind of how it works right now.

20:22 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so I'll, even, I don't know if you want to bring up something or thinking out all the oxygen in the room.

20:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  No, I'm following along and I'm interrupting when I see the need so far. do you recognize this, Yvonne?

20:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you recognize it based on talking to the customers?

20:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Could you join the new customer meetings?

20:45 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I mean, I'm aware of these customers and I basically agree. I'm not aware of the stakes or the importance of each of them because that changes a lot through the time.  So you're the one with best overview and this map is really helpful. had it's now only question of priorities it's basically it's a hard because we have to build things to get these these companies on board so we now have to see what do we build first and that's the key for this and we are going in that direction so I'm just following along but yeah this map is helpful I would say this is really good map and as I agree with you that this will change over time and yeah when it changes I think it's good that you update it and and let us know but I guess priorities will also change with it so yeah I mean from this map I think we need to get the list of priorities this is also important so yeah that's good perfect thank you thank you yeah so we all have the same picture of this which is great okay let me just check out something so Abby also put something here about I impact low efforts yeah like yeah so then I don't know like Louis really said from like you know this then it goes to what should we focus on

22:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and then you have what should be achieved. I didn't know exactly how to fill it in, so I just made it a guess like skilled workers with digital tools, unskilled workers for ESG compliance.  don't know, I just started filling out, maybe you recognize this framework more than I do. Then the effort one, I just started, I just made a copy because I wasn't sure I was doing it right, but I was just trying to think about.  Yeah, I really had the score, can be done in a few hours, a few days, a few weeks, several weeks a month.  Then the impact, I haven't really, we could spend some time trying to think if this is right, or we can spend some time using yours to figure out what it is, and then put it in here later.  Then on here, I was just more trying to figure out what to tell the board Q1, Q2, Q3, what are we going to focus on?  yeah, so that's where it is.

22:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'll just copy all of this stuff, I want to leave it, I'll just copy it,

23:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  into the other one, which I just did.

23:05 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I'll send you all the link to the other one here on the chat.

23:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Here.

23:12 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  There you go. It should be open. Everybody should be able to access it.

23:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I can stop sharing if you want to share your screen too.

23:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah. I think I'll share the recorder gets the proof. Let's single view from that. Where is it? Share. Okay.  yesterday, we went through this thing down here, and we listed a couple of things. We stopped around this time.  Okay. And one of the things that became clear was that we had, you know, multiple sections, and these sections also had different, multiple  different dimensions like the e dimension the s dimension than the g dimension and they also had different refinement states let's say so we are comfortable with long section I don't know dashboard with only these things but in the future we'd like it to have these other things right so I'll bring everyone to me and I put together this thing and there's there's two discussions we could be having here so let me show you these graphs above I use the AI tool to help me put this together but I verified and it's directionally correct and basically these are three levels of the same sort of thing and I'm bringing this here this is from the c4 model it's a way of visualizing this sort of thing and so this level level two okay level one is two abstract so we have  our solution here, the ESG management system, and it has different parts to it, right? The entire hub, vendor enterprise view, employee view, admin view, right?  And we have different people interacting with it, right? This is basically what the system does to each person, right?  If we go deeper and then we can zoom in on some aspects, it can come on into this way.  And now I'm showing you this because I think we don't need to memorize any of the specific boxes here.  It's just that to keep in mind that, okay, so there's different parts to it, right? So the big red box is the Fortify system, basically, and we have different parts to it and we have databases and we need to send emails and we need to schedule things and we need to keep track of did the person reply to my communication or to my training message?

25:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Can I see the status of that?

26:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like you send a, you deploy the message for 400 people and you want to see which 20 have, you know, filled it in.  need to keep track of that sort of thing, right? And here, this is just an illustration to show that like if you are the compliance officer, you create communication which via a message composer, we generate a link that goes inside of the communication.  The person receives the link, either the employee or the third party from the link they enter the employee view or the third party view.  And then they confirm reading and then this is into our database. This is basically the core of the thing, right?  So with this in mind, we have here a huge gun chart that we could start trying to track things around.  It's already set up for the 35. And I've already stretch some of the things that we are working on right now and we can see if we are comfortable enough with these things.  And my suggestion is you try to do one and if it if we if we don't have the clarity we need we go back and use these little cards that I've made that could be useful to clarify some things okay.  So let's um I'll give an example and I think it'll make it easier. So now we have the admin view which is where you know the compliance officer can check on things and this thing has been developed and the the version the the view one of this which is focused on the e aspect okay e aspect will be done on January is this correct?  Which part?

27:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  deployment part? The admin view controls?

27:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I thought it was done?

28:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, I don't know. just put this in.

28:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Are you mean like when you say app and view is like onboarding view?

28:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I mean, OK.

28:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Controls, I think, mean, right?

28:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We have controls for employee view. We have controls for third party, and we have controls for the main thing, fortify user compliance officer thing, right?  Just so I'm sure.

28:29 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Think of it, this is what we are now building.

28:31 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  This should be done by the end of year. I understand correctly.

28:34 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Like the control section, you mean?

28:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think I got thrown off by admin.

28:38 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Like, you just mean like control section, Shell.

28:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because controls is something that is manifested on three different places.

28:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  The person that sets up the controls. OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, that makes sense then. OK, I know I'm together with you.

28:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, then Ivan said that's what they're building right now. Yeah, so that should be done by the end of the year.  We could change the next.

29:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  if it's more it's more in line with I think it makes sense that there are different views on that yeah so we have the end mean view on controls Ivan you said that this is uh this is okay right this this estimation for uh first this first pick of January it's it's okay do you agree with it yeah probably speaking okay yeah so we have that for controls we have that for policies all on the east side right there's I didn't put anything on the s and the g and we have that for cons then we have that for training right we are not currently working on reporting we are not uh oh the compliance map is also will also be done I assume correct but I guess the admin view for policies procedures and training the same view whether it's s or g does that make sense exactly yeah that's great

30:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is it the same?

30:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, it's the same.

30:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So you would just be updating different content like an environmental policy or an environmental training versus an anti bribery corruption policy versus.  So it's more the content that's missing on the deployment part that's missing right now.

30:15 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  In that in that case, I think we should separate it because I think if you look at at this graph, like three weeks from now, we our memory is not as as good as it is right now.  We will remember that we still need to do the content part because if it's a task that needs to be done, we need to be able to see that as has not done yet.  I can change the names of course. But for instance, maybe content for. Yeah, it could be like content because the development might be done, but the content is not done.  And that's what I'm trying to do right now. Yeah, that makes sense.

30:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, content for yeah. And then the content she is. Yeah, I guess we still need to update the policies and the trainings around that.

31:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, let me zoom out a little bit. The compliance map, the view one, I understand it's being done or is it done already?  Compliance map is done, but it needs a UI update, visual update, I think. Yeah, a visual update is fine.

31:44 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I'll just create something else.

31:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like a visual update. Okay, and that thing will happen around the same time, maybe in January.

32:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  because this right now is beginning of January right yeah is this correct is this yeah so the admin the the with the one that you just made that admin you're the yellow one right or no where are I yeah I am the yellow one yes you see my my mouse yeah I am seeing it yeah just thinking that the compliance map one where is that I don't see it now admin view third-party admin oh compliance map so the view of the compliance v1 yeah that that gray one here I'm trying to hold it but I can't what I'm just trying to move it to the right to like January cuz right now we're still in December right like yeah over you have the visual update already okay sorry I'm my thing is slow yeah okay

33:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, so what what the lines illustrate is not just the end date is yeah, yeah. So just to make sure I mean this mirror thing is great because it puts everything in the same place but it's not as it's not as perfect as some other tools so one of the difficulties I found is I cannot reorder things so we need to scroll up and down.  So employee. In the employee protocol, there's the policy experience where I receive a policy and I need to confirm it to confirm that.  Does that change depending on the.

33:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, the content. Yeah, the content will change.

33:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we need to do both the content and the design for it.

33:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We have the G ready, but we don't have the S for the E ready. And it's most likely the E is what needs to be done by the end of January.  or the S will probably, we won't start until Q3. Okay, so Q2.

34:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I'll just pull this out here. A lot of things, I'll just pull it. So at the start of Q2, look at this, but the question, so I am an employee.  I've just received the policy and this policy is related to governance. Yeah, that will be, we will work on that on the second quarter, correct?

34:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well, the governance ones, I think, I guess we still need a little bit of a content on G, but the tool is ready in terms of deployment.

34:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  think it's more like UX, like UI.

34:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Maybe we want to update the UI on it with what stuff Romeo has done. But it's more of the content of which employee.  The policy, are they going to review, you know, which training are they going to review? I think we need to visual update.

35:05 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We need to maybe update.

35:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We need to add add some questions we need to even has to add like a question functionality for the for the training, like question functionality for the training.

35:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, that should be done before we deploy it so by the beginning of February, I guess. Is that is that is that all certain are we that that feature needs to be done by the end of February?  It has to be.

35:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  it's pretty because that would be the first thing we deploy is policies, procedures and trainings. So once we deploy it, has to be in.  It has to be in it to deploy it.

35:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  My point is the questionnaire. I mean the question. I understood that after an employee. Yeah.

36:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I send you an environmental test training, it's not just for you to sign up. I looked at it. like at the end of the test, you have to answer five questions to make sure that you are paying attention to that.  That's what we're missing right now. We don't have that functionality, but I realized in the ISO, you need to have a test to confirm that they have to have some proof that they understood the material and that's like a quiz.  That quiz function before they can actually sign off and pass it needs to be there.

36:36 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

36:39 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We to think about what about the custom ones. Because some people will be able to create custom policies.

36:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  what about those? But then maybe, We can also either make them, yeah, because that's only an ISO requirement. If they don't want to have an ISO requirement, then you might not need to have  quiz in the end but at the same time knowing them like they're going to be like we want a quiz at the end because that's usually most MS systems can have a quiz at the end.

37:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  but I I think it's kind of important that we insist on this because this would be a case I mean it's very likely that you are correct that people will ask for that but what thing we will not have time for to make time for this you know and if it is the case that you know some people if you ask people like would you like to have a quiz at the end they'll say yes if you ask people what do you mean they might say something else.

37:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah and this is why I think like in one way of looking at this if we want to just think about prioritization and this is why I like Cognite is like what do we need to develop so that Cognite can pass the ISO you know forget about S forget about G right now like if ISO getting Cognite on  ISO is our plan, like what do we need to do? Because the G side, none of them are going for the ISO.  They have a little bit more time for deployment, like even in Q2, you know, while we set things up.  But for like development, if we want to get Cognite on there and we want to do that, then it should be like, what do we need to build in the tool to get Cognite able to pass the ISO audit in a way?  And then, you know, like you're saying, like reporting and board, you know, like that section we haven't looked at.  like for them to pass the ISO, they might not need a very detailed part. They just might need a repository of where we put all the manual stuff in there so that they can check it off for an ISO temporarily, you know.  But there's more like workflow parts about policies, procedures and trainings and control that they need to be with evidence that's harder to do without a tool.

38:49 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So like that part, if we get that core part right, then they use it and it's going to help them.

38:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then the manually do the reporting and audit trail during in the meantime, you know. So, yeah, that could be a way to look at prioritization.

39:04 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so we are aiming at serving Cognite really well, because that will open other doors. And we accept that some other clients might get not as good an experience as Cognite will have.  Are we okay with this?

39:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, because I think nobody is as urgent as Cognite because like the other ones, and you talk to them, they're like, we can start in February, like, yeah, no, we're not really needing to do this because we're not going for ISO, we don't really have a timeline.  I think like, but Cognite is like, we have a timeline and they want it as soon as possible. And so like, I think that, and they also want to prepay already.  They're like asking to prepay and do everything. So they want to like, so it's like how do you get them the ISO audit, both online and offline and also have them use the tool so they can say that they use the tool for the audit purpose.  Okay.

40:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so we are going for Cognite, and Cognite wants ISO, and the ISO requires some sort of questions at the end for the quiz.  It's important that before we build the quiz, we realize what's the very minimum that ISO requires. If ISO just says, I want a questionnaire, we could just have like three questions, and that's it.  Yeah, I think it is like that.

40:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's like one to three questions max, and then it's like, you can't submit it until you've gotten the right answer.  I think that's all we need there. Yeah.

40:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so for now, for January, we will have the employee view where the employee reads a new policy and confirms reading of that policy without the quiz.  Is this correct?

40:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well, we already, yeah, we already have that, I think, in a ready. We don't have, we don't have, I guess, I realize like we don't have all the walkthroughs, and maybe this is what role.  needs is like when they click on read the policy, what does it look like? I guess, or we kind of have that developed in the app already, right?

41:08 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, when you click on policy you can see the text and you can change it, you can deploy it, all that stuff.

41:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then if we can come in, they can read the policy and they can acknowledge it and then it changes the state to acknowledge for that employee.  Okay, so content for S, we're leaving it for quarter two. Content for G, are we also leaving it for quarter two?

41:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think we can leave it for like the end of quarter one, because we already have a lot of it, so it's more about optimizing it for the end of quarter one.  I do feel like the first two months we really need to try to get E ready to to deploy, meaning the first month I like I need to get you guys the content by the beginning of January, and then we need to implement that in January.  in February.

42:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so I'll bring that to January. Because I'm separating the aspect of, you know, getting the content and then turning the content into, you know, designs and then code, right?  So creating the content, I'm understanding from what you say that goes from mid-January to early February.

42:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  For G, a lot of the content for G already done, it's more like the optimization of it and testing it out of it.  what I like about Cognite also is that we don't have an E, right? So we're creating content, but there is some optimization for G, but I feel like, I don't know, I feel like we're getting kind of two into the details and two kind of loss into the overall thing because we also have limited time.  I'd rather just be like, what are the tasks that we need to do to get E right in the next, like,  Or maybe like some high-level one like you know like because we don't know every part of the Thingly yet.  I don't know even what do think?

43:09 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Well, I think this is good that that we're doing this now because it's important We are now getting overall picture of when something needs to be done You know because it's easy to get lost in all of these because we mentioned already like six or seven different Epics or categories or big features that we need so I like this because I think If we draw it out, then we know what needs to be done when and then everyone is clear on what needs to be done in January, February, March, April Yeah That's my opinion because it's currently it's we are a bit, you know, discussing lots of things some are more important Some are less important.  So having it mapped.

43:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I like to be honest more. It's more clear to me So I just dragged. I don't know if you're following me all the way to me I I copied this stuff that Abby was working on on the other mirror  I brought it here. there's a few matrices. Is any of them like the final one?

44:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How do I know which one? Yeah, like if you look at it, so it's kind of like maybe we should start at the top one where I am right here, copy it.  That's what we started first, right? And then this was like this is the original one that like drawing out of kind of the original one that that Rui made, which is like low effort versus high impact.  And then, you know, do it next and that. And then so I tried to break it down on like what needs to be done there.  And then like, you know, like CSR D mapping, maybe move down and priority depending on it. So that's that one.  But then if you go down to Q1, Q2, then it's also kind of like these are the things that like tried to split it up like the yellow ones or development needs to happen.  Some subject matter expert, meaning this is the documentation that needs to happen by Q1, you know, and then And then like, like, yeah, SME, then, like, one is around sales and marketing that needs to be done in Q1.  And then I think, I didn't, I think I was getting to design and I ran out of time, like the design part that needs to happen, you know, in each of these months here to make sure, you know, like, you know, I don't know, like reporting or something like that.

45:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Let's use this as a backbone for the Gantt chart we're making. So we draw the big chunks on it, and then we figure out what tasks need to be done to achieve those big chunks.  I'll just, I'll just copy it. Sorry, I'll just copy it to be nearer.

45:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I can, I can maybe explain it to you too, because I realized, like, yeah, when you copy that, I can explain it to you what I, what I mean.  So you can see the overall kind of year goal on it. So the first Q1, I kind of, if you look about, I'm going to ignore the high impact high, whatever.  But if you look at Q1, Q1 is all about getting the product. deployed onto our customers, And it's like thinking about AI and then like customer onboarded on ISO 14001.  that would be kind of the main goal. in order to do that, you have the ISO documentation ready in order to be able to deploy, right?  Q2 is that then we're like the full product is ready and we onboard more of the pilots onto it, like with the G and the S part, I should be like all pilots onboarded.

46:31 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I don't know if they're converting, but they're onboarded at least.

46:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  everybody is trying our, by March everybody should be trying our tool whether it's ES or G, right? And then I need to put this here.  So I need to create this stuff for social around this time. then ideally we'll have case studies, we'll have some AI being created by the end of June and we'll have the product tool ready to scale past pilots, right?  So it's kind of the same, these are kind of linked. I don't know if we need that or just pick one.  then by quarter three, ideally we have paying customers.

47:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  after the summer, we've converted them and they're paying because Q3 is important.

47:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Then we have a clear sales strategy. We have the CSRD part of the tool ready and defined in development so that it's ready because that's going to be a big, like that's the next step after ISO is to map to ISO to CSRD.  So then we can say we're a CSRD company and then we have a clear sales and marketing company. This is all why having Q3 is that because we need to have this in order to go for seed round in order to, like we have to have all of this in place before we can get funding.

47:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then funding would be in Q4.

47:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So that's kind of like the high level kind of goal that we need to do. Like we need to just test a few in Q1, test all of the rest of them in Q2, get them to convert.  get have a new sales strategy and understanding of like where are target customers that we're going to have. So in Q4 we can be like we need seed money because we have everything ready to scale now.  We have the product ready.

48:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We have like the main focus of the regulation ready. We have a good go-to-market strategy.

48:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Now if you just give us money then we can execute and that's kind of what we need to do a high level to get there.  Got it. it.

48:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Which is somewhat aligned to this thing we did yesterday on the Yeah. It's similar right? It's not the same thing I understand.  There's a different level of detail here. Okay.

48:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah so I feel like we could also like yesterday I felt like I like the one on top that we had and then we just kind of ran out of that first line that you know the training policies like those small boxes and that could be something you know the small boxes on top of E that maybe is where we should spend some time on today that could be like you know yeah right here like this part you know we never broke it down  into smaller pieces and that could be something we do. don't know.

49:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We can do that. Okay, let's do that. Yeah, does actually align.

49:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Now that I see this, see that. Yeah, it is kind of, yeah, align with that.

49:18 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think the main point of bringing the boxes here is that these boxes are icebergs. It's very easy to say communications and there's so much complexity behind this.  So we need to be really careful and kind of underestimate or overestimate how long things will take because it's, there's like a world of things inside of each one of these boxes.  And one of things I was trying to do with this thing because I didn't bring it up yet was trying to add detail to those boxes.  So we would know, okay, what's, you know, what does it mean communications for the pilot version? Does it mean communications for the more scalable version?  What does it mean for the environment, social, and governance?

50:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And yeah, let's try to bring the small ones.

50:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We'll try to bring the small ones. Are they all of them? Yeah, the blue ones. Yeah, the blue ones are here.  So OK, let's try to use the blue ones. So for now, Q1 training communications, right?

50:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  In terms of the admin view, the user, the main user, the compliance officer view.

50:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

50:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'll go down there and pick up the other bits. I don't know what this one is, I can't see it.

51:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So is the dashboard with the widget from each ESG letter?

51:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think this is like, because how do I say it's like, I think it's a little bit confusing in the sense that like, you need all of these, like, at least like the box or like, you know, kind of put in by the time, you know, so then like in Q2 Q3, it's going to be like, how do we optimize it for us?  How do we optimize it for G, you know, so it's like, but Placeholders need to be so it's almost like training E training.  You know what I mean? it's not Like I don't like when you look at like the way that it's set up now And then we have the whole tool, you know what I mean Agree.

52:12 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, so that's what we see it.

52:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess we have it on the bottom, right? We have an E on the down here and then we have S starting in that and then G Like we see that like s doesn't start like doesn't start until You know until q3, you know, so it's kind of Yeah So this kind of like q3 or q2 q2 because like, you know q3, you know, we need to have the We have to have the We we have to have it ready, right?

52:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So you could we could actually add some of the boxes from the one underneath into Into that one to make it more sense Let me write that You  Thank So, so I understand what you mean that the way we put this blue and yellow boxes does not convey all  the effects of it or maybe like okay is that why we have yellow policies because yellow we don't have like you know like because we have policies and we have communications twice on number one under number one so does that mean one is like g communication and then one blue i'm not sure do you know if you follow me there's two communications i know know i know the yellow one is the employee view and the one is the compliance officer let's say i see i think this is one of the complex challenges of this of this platform because it has everything needs to be manifested twice from the side of the compliance officer or equivalent person and the side of the person that receives that information right yeah exactly i don't know um even how would this be helpful for you i guess in terms of

55:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  you know information that you need for development like is it better that we go back to that original one where we're kind of more detailed that you you like that I wasn't a fan of but maybe that will help you better I think this is better so I think if for now enough it's enough to have a like these icebergs like I mentioned like we said for January February March I think that's that's a good enough because I have a good feeling that in March all of the things will be changed because that's just how it is dynamic so for me information I need actually is what will be the plan to do for January February March January it's already defined I would say we already went through the stuff for January that's more or less clear February and March are a bit less clear so if we could define what we will be doing from the bigger picture point of view in the Q1 of this year I think that's already good enough for me to plan to have a good overall picture and also I think good  I think it's good enough to have like just general information like saying in Q3 we want to have, I don't know, G or something like that and that's good enough for now because I think things will change a lot during a couple of months so I would suggest that we just start with Q1 and maybe Q2 and that's stop there and don't go into too much details.  Because it's hard to plan for something that's so far ahead and some things are uncertain and so on so answer the question what I need is I need a as detailed plan for Q1 as possible that that's I need.

56:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, and makes sense to me I agree with that that what we have for now for January it's clear enough you need more clarity on February and March in correct.

56:55 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah because January is mainly polishing things up.

57:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  uh applying new design patching things that we are missing so on that the general description of what we are doing in january uh and then what what happens next what's what's in february arch okay i know we need to do the e side not the g side but but what exactly what does that mean exactly does that mean i don't know add another button on this page or remove a button on that page if this page is seen and so on that's the answers i'm looking for in the end that's the outcome i want to get from all of this so got it got it okay so for the first quarter we'll want to have a customer onboarded the product deployed and ai development begins iso 14,001 documents are ready okay i guess that's like kind of uh yeah yeah okay no no uh i'm i'm thinking how do we translate these into specific development  tasks which I understand it's Ivan's question, correct?

58:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, from all of these cards, okay, for January I think it's clear I can, I always refer back to that email that I sent, I think that's for him, but I would like to have things like that listed out so we can just create cards or create like features or stories or whatever and we can start from there and there we can start diving deeper into it.  For example, for January, let me pull up the email, for January it says here new, we have the email.  Yeah, okay. So hold on, I'm lost between screens. yeah, basically, I don't know, it says take any bullets from there, that's a story, okay, and that's what we need to do.  Okay, to do it, what do we need? First thing, we need design.

58:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, for most of these designs ready, that's good.

58:57 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  What else? We need to plan development and that's it. And that's clear.

59:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I would like to do the same things for the following months.

59:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  when we say for, if you zoom in on Q1, please, this board, when we say third-party management as a box, what does that exactly mean?  I understand that third-party will require some adjustments in the flow. I know that. But we need to start talking specifics and starting to dive deeper into it.  We need to do it for all of these items in this Q1 box. But let's start in order. What's first?

59:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  For example, on the left side in January, you have this training policies listed.

59:38 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But I think it's clear. Most of them are clear, I would say. If I'm not mistaken, I'd be changes for these are clear because they are from that email.  But for what's not clear, I would like us to dive deeper and define how will it look like. And that's what I would like.

59:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

59:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Exactly.

59:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think let me see that email.

1:00:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  because I had some like in that or maybe that email is up there like they're like yeah there is some like if time they get if time then that that I would say the if time part would be the February at least um there uh along yeah I think if time that could be the February part okay and now so now my question for example for number one in the if time is task management assigning tasks and overview good I more or less understand what that means but I want to know exactly what that means does that mean task management on each of these controls policies communications does that mean only task management on policies does that mean adding some kind of overview to dashboard I want to understand what that exactly means so that I can plan how much time we need for it what do we need for it and so on and I guess Zhao needs the same to do the actual design if it's not already done I don't know okay so when you talk can we experiment

1:01:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  You can see if this works. it doesn't, just throw it out this this format.

1:01:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There's a list of tasks, correct?

1:01:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Well, I kind of, but we right now we don't have the preset list of tasks.

1:01:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But if you think about like the, if you think about, let me try to share my, if you think about our, I'll just share my screen really quick to try to explain it, because I think this is a key part of our thing.  here, if you look at our thing, we have like tasks that require actions because we can deploy these. All of these tasks, so all of those tasks should somehow be mapped from our compliance map.  everything you do in here, could be like, if you do, like each of this is like select suppliers, you know, maybe a task, or maybe it is just like start the third-party management process or complete the third-party management.  Like everything you haven't done should be put into a task. Even one small thing I just noticed is that when you click risk assessment here it goes straight to here versus the other ones here.

1:02:09 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah that's because risk assessment has only one.

1:02:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I remember I didn't even pick this one to be honest. Okay but that's my point is like in the dashboard like this is kind of a good selling point like it tells you what you need to do or you get to create your own tasks say like send an email to this person you know a lot of the compliance managers who know what they're doing they like to have like the task management part of it that's what I meant by that yeah but is it need to be done in February maybe not like not to pass the ISO right like but maybe to convert heat or rain you need it I don't know yeah.

1:02:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I think the concept of the task is very clear and I think that probably the information we need is the list of tasks in a format agnostic thing like a word document like these are all the tasks for if you want to pursue ISO something if you want to pursue ISO whatever there's a different list of tests right so basically if we have a task management system what we need is a list of tasks and a way to control their status like I have done this I haven't done this yet right that's basically what it is and the origin of these tasks could be their preset like we give you a list of tasks that helps you because you don't just tell you what to do or it could be customized for more advanced users right but we always need a preset list of tasks because that's what helps the compliance officers the especially the junior ones know exactly what they should be doing right so so  Does this make sense that we, for whatever way we manifest the task management system, we will need a list of tasks to feed into that system?  Yeah. Okay.

1:04:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

1:04:12 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So... Sorry, do you want to share your screen too so we can have that?

1:04:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, okay.

1:04:16 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Sorry.

1:04:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Share the screen.

1:04:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay. So the pilot version will have a list of tasks for different objectives, right? Like ISO something something is one list of tasks, ISO something else is another list of tasks.  Is this correct? Yeah.

1:04:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm.

1:04:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  The question is, Abby, do you want to also, mean, I think you do, but let's pull it up.

1:04:53 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Do you want to have auto-generated tasks? I think that's the key here and that's the most complicated because creating a to-do...  task list is like the easiest thing but the problem not the problem but we have to define how will the task auto be created because what abby wants and what our users want i think is so imagine that you didn't create a policy for example you didn't create and deploy all the policies you deployed only five out of six and then the idea you have a task in your task was automatically generated which says deploy the policy number six for example right abby something like that yeah or yeah exactly something simple in the beginning being like you have not completed the management section or you have not completed the risk management policy section meaning that you haven't collected all five or six yeah yeah but so and what i'm thinking is so you need a set of we need us to help to tell people what tasks they need to be done we need to have some sort of a of a baseline right

1:06:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  For instance, I know that if you want to pursue ISO 1400, I'll just say ISO 14 is quicker. So if you want to pursue ISO 14, there's this 20 things you need to do, right?  This is like a really crappy experience.

1:06:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This is an Excel spreadsheet.

1:06:18 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's really . And then another layer or level of refinement is when you join the app, we will ask you what kind of things do you already have done?  you say, I've done this, this, this, this, this. And then you say, oh, you've done like 12% of all the things you need to do.  And these are the things that are missing. This is still not amazing, but it's still better than just a checklist, right?  On the third level, it's probably something like just upload all the things you have. I'll check them out and I'll tell you what you need to do, right?  This is the AI thing. And this would be like the golden standard. just feed it stuff and it looks into it and figures out, oh, this thing, you have done it.  but maybe you could improve it, right? In terms of a vision of an aspirational thing, this AI automated just feed me anything and I'll tell you what to do.  It's I think where the platform wants to get to, right? But for the MVP, what's like a good level before needing AI to have that?

1:07:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think if we're thinking of the MVP for Cognite, then just even like a checklist, an Excel checklist that has been digitalized will be fine.

1:07:36 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay. And so we have a checklist, we asked them, they tell us we've done these things, the things that they have not done, we just put them on the...  I think a minimum, I think that would be it.

1:07:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Ideally, it would check it itself off if it's done the policy or the training, but then it checks it off itself.  again, I think that's maybe something we might need by June, by the time we scale it. But in the short term of trying to get companies onto the ISO and just showing that we can pass so we can get more companies on it.

1:08:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think a very task list would be to start with too, so then they know that it's being done.

1:08:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it.

1:08:17 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Good things and this can be done in phases just like Joel mentioned, so I think it's good because we can start with basic tasks and then add on it some automatic task generation, suggestions, blah, that can all be added along the way.  We don't have to have immediately the full product there, I think. And it's good that the customers are not expecting it, I guess.

1:08:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, yeah, because every time we do something better, we just blow their minds instead of them. OK, so for the task management, we'll need a list of tasks and we already have a component code that allows us to list those tasks correctly and we can also...  manually press and say I've done this task, right? Right now this is within reach.

1:09:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, as I'm like I'm getting the task list ready like now as part of the content over the winter of like what needs to be done for e to be able to pass.

1:09:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we'll begin with the um so list of tasks for ISO 40. Okay. Are there anything so assumptions? We'll begin with the environment version, correct?  Or the government version? Governance version?

1:09:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We'll begin here. so here.

1:09:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Cool. Are there things that we don't know about this? For instance, oh, we don't know Let me just explain the idea of this exercise, maybe it will help me.  The green things are things we are sure of about the environment version, right? The yellow things are things that we suspect we're not fully sure.  The orange things are things we do not know, and the blue things are just to-do lists for this version, okay?  So we need a list of tasks for ISO 14001. Are there other things that we need to figure out about the environment version, or just having the task list will be enough to start?

1:10:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This is where I feel like, I don't know, feel like going into the task is not the right process for here, because there is, I was going to share my screen to show you a little bit of what I've been doing.  So do you see this EMS document? I've been kind of going back and forth, working with a consultant on this.  So. In each of each of these is a document and something that needs to be executed on our tool somehow, right, so like this EMS manual and policy here is an EMS policy that with with text that needs to be deployed on our policy on our on our policy part, you know, like some some people will need to see this like the the maybe the management board.  And then needs to be deployed through our process, and then this is probably the one that this environmental policy is probably the ones that employees all need to check off right and say that they've read it right.  And then and then you have. So that's that one and then you have in each of them you have procedures right some of these procedures are going to be internal.  Like you know you need to have a plan for managing document changes and that which might be able to be just in our tool and we can manage the document changes in there.  Other ones are like you need to have training right and then there's an example of like.

1:12:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  a training plan on how you're going to execute it that you just need to store somewhere, but then there's actually a plan on how you record who's done the training.

1:12:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But we don't need this because this is part of our control. So we don't have a piece of thing.  We automatically have a list that's generated from when you've completed the training. So we don't necessarily need one. Then we need to record who's done the training and that, but that would be generated in our system.  each one of these, and I just got this, so I'm going through each one of these to see procurement is most likely here's the list of suppliers that we would actually have that's actually built into our third-party tool.  So we don't need this document, but it's already there. But you might need to have a standard procedure or how you're going to do the procurement that you need to document that matches our process so that there shows that there's a documentation trail for that.  So all of these, once I run through them over Christmas time, will result in a little bit of a change in our tool, like, or a  it might create new boxes within the controls or new information that we need to be able to pick up from employees to build.  And then that eventually will turn into tasks that need to be done. So I feel like it takes some time that I need to get all of this into a manageable things so that over Christmas or then in the new year I can discuss it maybe with the design team like in early January and kind of go through and then they can start drawing some of this and then and then Yvonne has already enough stuff for January right but like so that is so we work with you in January to make sure that this part is ready so that it could be deployed like then it could be designed in February maybe you know um so that's kind of the thinking and then deployed in like in March maybe you know so yeah that's kind of what like so I feel like going into task management is a little bit too premature because like there's still so much that we need to figure out you know like the implementation docs that

1:14:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Stakeholder analysis some of these things need to be built into our tool Yeah, makes sense then so I would say we just need to postpone these discussions a bit and that's it But I would still say that this is the thing we need to do and it's just no question of order in which order Do we need to do so?  Yeah, I From what I understand we just need to postpone the discussion until you get the answers you need from these things you mentioned, right?

1:14:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so that's what I think Yeah, and this is like in order to get like so some yeah, exactly I need to get my head around this a little bit more and like I I've hired a consultant who who's an ISO auditor say like what Exactly are the documents and the minimum things we need to do for a digital company to be able to pass the ISO and The ISO can be passed offline, right?

1:14:51 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like people pass it without a system.

1:14:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it's more like So we can get Cognite to pass just being totally offline, which we don't want though, right because we want to be able  to do at least the training or at least some parts of this online, even if it means some parts of it's offline while we're building the rest of it.  But I think, but yeah, this is what I need to get my head around. But I just got the latest version today.  I had the older version on like a few yesterday and I gave some feedback and now he's giving me an updated version.

1:15:25 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So that's what would be the best, the most productive way for you, Abby, to use the time of the remaining time of this session?

1:15:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess it's like, are we able to, I just maybe like the overall plan for 2025 that you have?  I think it's like if you were to go to the that mirror and go there, can we? somehow make it make sense that like because I think it's still a good like if you think about like you know Xiao you and the Brazilian team and the resources that you need to put in right like or even in the resources that need to put in for you guys to also understand high level you know like what do we need to do over you know I was thinking this one if you follow me like like what what high level do you need to to to be yeah to be involved or something so I don't know if there's a way to somehow update this that it makes more sense or more details so that you guys are able to also see like or like you know what is the likelihood like you know if like I was just going through this because Cognite is asking like when do we put the contract for the official outside of the pilot period she was like can I do you know March 1st and I was like no maybe I should April 1st you know because then we at least have Q1 done but then after looking at this maybe we actually I should say Q2 at the end of  Q2 that we convert because I don't think it's like if let's say we need to like change all of these documents and then add it to the environmental section like you know is it are we kind of putting it in for February and March you know and then and then for March like I don't know if we can like somehow break it down a little bit more like on on this side somehow like I test cognite like I don't know like how to be able to show it more like like it like this is like it could be like ISO documents needs to be and then like and then ISO documents and then like ISO development you know like  It needs to be in the second and third month, I guess, you know, and then or like, so it's like ISO e documentation and then I'm just trying to think and then ISO, ISO e design, right?  Because then you guys in January need to do the, like, I need to get, I need to get this to you guys, you know, in the beginning of the first month.  So then you guys can do the design, you know, up here and then and then the e is, you know, development there and then I need to do, like, and then while after you guys are doing the design, then it's like, it's like, what is it?  Do we need to do, like, the, the, yeah, the design is the development and management, you know, sections and then it's like, you know, reporting, reporting.  and design something like that, and then reporting and development like something, and then like reporting and development. don't know.  just trying to like something like, yeah, I guess you have this kind of right. guess that's the thing on the right, but I was just trying to do like a high level of version of that.

1:19:25 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Got it. it. So this is mostly an issue of Zoom level, right? This thing was too zoomed in, and it was too zoomed out, and we need an intermediary Zoom level that allows us to understand the broad strokes of things.  Yeah, the broad strokes because now I'm like telling Cognite, I was like, I was going to have Cognite like, like are we really able to convert Cognite?

1:19:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like based on everything that needs to be done in E, you know, are we able to convert them by August?  Because this is like when like they want it to be. So I don't know, I'll even look at this.

1:19:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Maybe I don't have a good perception on this. But the way I imagine this is that the platform should be made like a skeleton on which we put skin, right?  And if the skeleton is good, we can change the E and the G and the S really easily. And we forget those basic building blocks, how it feels for them to send out a policy, how it feels for people to agree on a policy.  If those things are correct, changing the content of that experience shouldn't be difficult because it's based on the text.  Do you agree with this, Yvonne? know, I think I trust your judgment on this.

1:20:42 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I mean, yeah, as far as I understood, yes.

1:20:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Because it doesn't feel to me that we need to rework a lot of things as we move from S to, from E to S to G, right?  Basically, what we have is a task management tool. that connects with other things and if those systems work we could be asking about sg or some other letter that comes up next year you know it would work.  So to me it feels like what needs to be developed is mostly just the bare bones version of can I send the communication to someone and I can know if they have agreed to it and we could like fill these up in the current prototype we could if we could fill this up with like fictional information there's oh there's a task which is scratch a cat it doesn't matter because if it works it will work with whatever tasks the tasks we put into it you know and I think if we separate the content from the from the engine it might I don't know might be even faster I suppose but I'm not a developer so maybe I'm assuming things from other people's work I mean it depends

1:22:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  And it really depends on the details, you know, so we are now talking lots of general stuff, but once we start diving deeper into the exact implementation of s and e's, maybe they are in some way different than g, so maybe we will need to change some stuff and so on.  it really depends, it really depends hard to save from this standpoint. But I agree with you though, I think we already have a good basis for g.  I think I'd be right, g is what we're building for now. Yeah, g is close.

1:22:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, g is close.

1:22:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  then now we need to see how much e is actually different. and from what I understood, mainly it's not different, but there's some difference in the third party and we are not happy with third party and so on.

1:22:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we need to start answering those questions. How does the third party need to look? And that type of thing.

1:22:50 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  basically, I just to just to repeat again, I think it comes to this. The process should be as simple as this.

1:22:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What do we need to have?

1:23:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  the next question, the answer is then let's design it and let's develop it and that's it. For that, of course, Abby needs to help us get the definition of it.  So find the priority, define it, design it, develop it, and I would say those four steps are the key.  It's just now a question of when to do what, and I'm oversimplifying. Of course, it's not an easy process, if someone asked me to simplify, that would be the simplification.  I think we are doing that. It's just now a question of what's next, and we already answered that for task management, that we are not ready for task management yet, so I would say that's not the answer.  So the answer would be probably, I don't know what's the answer, yeah.

1:23:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we need to look at our roadmap and see what's- Yeah, and this is like, I think this is a, yeah, so I think this roadmap maybe is kind of high level like this, and I don't know if you agree with this.

1:23:56 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We have to get the E part as soon as ready to-

1:24:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  line for for e like in Q1 we need to get e ready meaning like have like you know e will we will use first month to get the e right and then ideally deploy e within February like create e and then deploy it um and then we have at the same time while you guys are doing that we are looking at we were like thinking about what is in r and then what is in in s and you know this can also you know start here to here if we want because it might not be it might not we could also you know start this part because it might take some time to you know and then and then you have that and then maybe you could you know like I don't think reporting and development will be too complicated right like because it's more like I don't know we'll see but then maybe you could do social development I don't know like yeah that's a lot in that period right so this is what like but g is just updating like so it's not necessarily  But I think part of this is like, okay, you want me to two of your people working part-time. Is it going to slow down or based on looking at this, it going to end up going to end of April?  Because it depends again how much is in reporting, how much is actually in S. And then G is probably not that much, except for the task management, which is totally new.  So task management needs also a design for task management, you know.

1:25:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  If task management needs a design for task management. I think from what you already have, it's already designed task management.  So it's maybe more the content that needs to be created for it, like the checklists and stuff.

1:25:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah.

1:25:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

1:25:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then that should be in blue or something. I'm just trying to, something like that, I don't know.

1:26:40 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we will develop E and we'll refine, we'll develop E, we'll refine G, and then at some point we'll start doing the reporting and the management and also the S.  Towards the end of the year, not the third quarter, we'll follow. is on the CRCSRD and we'll begin also AI at the end of Q3, okay, okay.

1:27:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Even did this make sense to you in terms of? Yeah, yeah, as I said, Q1 is the key now right now.

1:27:26 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I would say it doesn't make too much sense talk about other queues but for me now Q1 sounds okay in general the plan but yeah we need to review it on the go.

1:27:37 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  yeah, January is clear, February and March need to be defined in more details.

1:27:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah and I see like this onboard 8 to 10 client maybe we're wrong right maybe actually you know for G we need to like finalize you need to finalize content we can do a few things offline you know and then try to  Yeah, see, like, we can onboard them, but maybe we can't convert them until later, because, like, some of them aren't starting until February, like, end of January, early February, so we can maybe say we're going to onboard them in March or, yeah.

1:28:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, I don't know.

1:28:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Does make sense?

1:28:36 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, this is the goal, the clients is the goal, and to onboard them we need to satisfy certain features, right, implement certain features, so also you have to keep that in mind, but I think that we have that in mind while talking about all of these boxes here.

1:28:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

1:29:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How does this make sense? Do you think that the Brazilian team will understand what we're trying to do here?  The pink is what needs to be designed. I'm sure there's additional like, how do I say this? There's going to be additional design optimization needed throughout this period.

1:29:44 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And the yellow is development? Yeah.

1:29:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like, you know, design optimization and hoc, right? Like, there's going to be continuous. throughout this, but these are the major ones.  guess it's the same thing with development. There's going to be more throughout the process. But yeah. I'm be tight though just like looking at this right like if we want to also start with the S development it's not going to be ready.  start onboarding with them converting and it's going to be a tight and then this is good because it's a reminder that it's a very tight.

1:31:03 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's still going to be pretty tight for some of these.

1:31:11 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. to revisit the plan and see how it, how, how, how, how are we doing here. Yeah.

1:31:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know.

1:31:36 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Why is it all continuous?

1:31:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you don't need that.

1:31:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  um, I like to leave that extra bar. Yeah.

1:32:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think this is okay, what do you guys think?

1:32:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, I think so, especially because it's more clear, mean, the closer horizon and it's more clear as we look towards the end of the year, it's more diffused, but I think that's normal, so it makes sense.  Quick question, just next to your pointer, there's R and D, is the reporting and auditing? Yeah, wrong, yeah, I spent the R and A, it's meant to be reporting and auditing.

1:33:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because some of these like, I think like, actually like, because some of these are kind of done at the same time, right, like, and this is more of a job and like your team, like, you know, would they be more free in February once they have, you know, that to like to start talking about these these things and like, yeah, and then and then kind of designing it.  So it's ready when you guys are ready to build it at the same time.

1:33:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  think, yeah, it feels directionally correct. Oh, we've spent the time. So if you could, when you're doing the ISO, you know, the checking of the different documents and so on.

1:34:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think

1:34:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Something that could be really useful and if you want I can try to help in that sense is if you Do it in a way that whenever we do the g or we do the s we can kind of see them side by side Yeah, because in that way we make sure that we are not You know Viewing off too much from yeah, what we've the way we structured you know, yeah Yeah, and I think that's the challenge I need to look really like how to get my head around it because there are there will be some aspects that are a little bit Different between e and g and then just the way that you manage it because g does involve more of the organization than e So like in terms of controls because a lot of it like to avoid bribery It's like the employees need to do a lot of what they do but to avoid like Electricity it's very hard to measure have the employees report something around that So just by the nature which makes it a little bit simpler for e in terms of deployment because you don't need to involve as many people But you do need to

1:35:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  all of them in policy people, policies, trainings and communication, but you don't need to involve them as much in controls.  So it's a little bit of a simpler design than, you know, you don't have like so many different governance, you know, ones that you need to fill in.  So that's the, the, the thing. Yeah, so, but I, I'm going to, that's, it's quite clear. need to get this ready by January that we can discuss it.  Then I can also maybe discuss it with the now, when you're gone to, or I'll probably need, yeah, and then, and then see too.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this is good. least this is actually something I can bring to the board, at least with a kind of an, an idea of how we're, how we're doing it.  Yeah. Mm hmm. I think so.

1:35:59 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  There's an AI. I posted here, is this here, or I'm not sure?

1:36:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, like in our start, I don't know if we need, just like when are we going to start even trying to make AI, I think, AI begins, or something.  So it's more like, I don't think maybe it's, I think when Mustafa starts, but it's also like, if we get the funding requirement, then we would start it there.  Got it, got it.

1:36:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Do you have, not for, it is not a discussion for now, but you already have like possible directions out to apply AI, or is the CTO thinking about that?

1:36:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's an idea, we're literally have, like this morning, we had a discussion with Walker Solutions on how they would like AI to be applied in the organization.  So his thing is now to put it into like clear like workflows that can like pass for the, pass for the proposal for our grant writer, and then our grant writer is going to submit it, and then if we get it, then we can be really flexible on.  how we do it. It doesn't have to follow that, but we need to create a proposal that would actually kind of win the grant.  So that's kind of the first goal towards this. Yeah. Got it. it.

1:37:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Perfect. So yeah. So I think this is good.

1:37:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  guess and more the question is terms of like follow up now that we're going into the holidays or like what is there something that Romeo I guess is all going on holidays soon, right?  what like is there anything that could be done in January? Maybe it's more waiting for me and then we meet in January and I can kind of share the work that's been done.  guess that's kind of the what needs to be done. Like I set up a time with Mal to kind of show him what was created.  Yeah.

1:37:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I feel that it's the more definition we have the less likely it is that two things that end up not being used.  So yeah, I would think that way, but the

1:38:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  few if you would like maybe to spend some time together to map out the e aspects uh maybe we could do that but it's completely up to you just thinking of what it's no i think it's more like yeah when when you guys are when you're when you're when you're free right and i think that um because you're you're going on holiday until the 13th they're 14th right no uh yes uh you will be back on the on the 13th of january which is on the so i'm just wondering like what can be done in the two weeks um but maybe i can meet with mao to kind of discuss you know this e documentation and the design or do you feel that it is there anything that could be done like the first two weeks at least is i was hoping that we can like would the design team do something while um or maybe it's not maybe it's  enough time just to have two weeks you know to design it might be enough time and just the start in mid-January you know I'm like because you guys are pretty fast on the other part right to design something I think it's by the end of January we should have a design ready so that Yvonne and his team can do it in in in February right because Yvonne you have enough for January already right yeah yeah so it could be that like maybe we have to have a few intensive sessions in in um when you're back Xiao maybe that's the best and we just kind of plan for when you're back we we have an intensive sessions rather than me trying to be with Mal and Romeo on the first two weeks what do you think I think that's better yeah to to do that those seconds afterwards because otherwise we might just agree on things without the full view of yeah so you're back on the 13th correct yeah we already have

1:40:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Two meetings for that day we have and on the 13th.

1:40:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Are you in Brazil or are you in? Okay, we have two meetings. Okay. Yeah.

1:40:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we can use those two meetings then.

1:40:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We have to we do have two meetings to design. Yeah. So then we could use those two meetings to kick off the, um, the e design, maybe.  Mm hmm. Right.

1:40:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Right.

1:40:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And if.

1:40:27 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Uh, yeah, I think I was, go ahead.

1:40:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I just need I might need to change this because I realize I think I'm flying out on the 13th and arriving on the 14th, but maybe with the time difference.  No, I think it should be okay because the time difference like five in the morning. So I won't be on a flight.  Yeah. So that's fine. We can just keep those. might in another one. I saw 14,001 e on on Wednesday.  Okay. Could that work?

1:40:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  what Wednesday's the 15th? the ISO 14, yeah, we do have time for that, ISO 14001 is the one about E, right?

1:41:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think it's just like ideally the week of the 13th, we would just like, you know, you can do your magic with trying to map out some of the things and the discussions of the research that I've learned so that we can put it into a design that then maybe on the 20th, the week of the 20th and 27th, then Romeo could prioritize like making the things ready so that by the 31st, then yeah, yeah, so let's schedule at least two sessions, yeah, correct, but I would prefer if it were Monday and Tuesday because then Romeo has more time to put things in place.  I can't because the only problem on the 13th or 14th I'm flying, I think we have the Monday so I think that's fine, but I think 14th I will be on a plane, so I ride back on the 14th.

1:42:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So maybe we could have the one on the Monday and then one on the Wednesday or Thursday.

1:42:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. What works best for you on any time on Wednesday?

1:42:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So it depends on where country you're in on Wednesday.

1:42:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'll be in Portugal. So one hour away from you. Okay. Yeah. So I guess that if Wei won't roll me on them to join, then it's 230 to 430 or 325 to 234, like around this time, guess.  Okay.

1:42:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'll just pencil this in. I guess just put it in here.

1:42:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I just sent the messages so we hold it.

1:42:42 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Oh, you're sending the invite? Okay.

1:42:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I'll send the invite. just sent it. But I think that the question is can you send a message to Romeo and Mal to kind of hold the last two weeks of January for intensive design?  Yeah. Yeah. I'll send it to you.

1:43:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, just so that they can get as we speak. Yeah, so then and then so then we have like kind of these two sessions.

1:43:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I almost feel like we might need three because there's a lot of different parts of E but no it's mainly controls actually.  So maybe it's not that many actually. It's more documentation.

1:43:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So. Okay, I've sent him a message. Yeah, so then that's good.

1:43:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Then then we'll have something ready. And I think it's good that we can look at that. And then we might need some more for like reporting and like social, but we can do that later.  I think I think the first goal would be in January to get as much as we can for E ready so that then the the development team can work on E.  Okay, so okay, we have put together a.

1:44:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  map view which is more detailed to January and we have enough view for the rest. We have agreed that you will check out the requirements and think about how to translate them into you know product specifications and we've also set up two meetings so far for when I when I'm back which is one on the Monday one on the Wednesday and the meetings will probably be Miro board kind of meetings where the output of those meetings is design directions for how to apply the e to whatever we have right now yes yes very good yeah got it perfect I'll organize that it's already on the agenda so it's good and I've already sent a message to them on the group chat great and anything else even if like and are we on the right track no I think I think this is fine yeah

1:45:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

1:45:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Great.

1:45:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right. Then I think we can just leave it from there, but thank you. I think this is also good because this roadmap I can use on the board meetings.

1:45:09 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think it's a little bit clearer.

1:45:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, we need to have this roadmap at any point in time.

1:45:16 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think we need to have something like this.

1:45:18 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, and we need to update it.

1:45:19 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So, it's good for everyone to know, know, even for developers to know what's the like, what's the goal, what are the next big things that we're building.  So, yeah, it's always good to have the or whatever. Yeah, that's a good question. What's the next big thing?

1:45:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Nice one.

1:45:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah. Okay, great.

1:45:35 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Then thank you for your time and happy holidays.

1:45:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Happy holidays. you until the mid-January, enjoy and enjoy your drive around. Likewise. Yeah. All right.

1:45:49 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Thank you. Be in touch.

1:45:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Thank you. Bye.

1:45:51 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Bye. Bye.
