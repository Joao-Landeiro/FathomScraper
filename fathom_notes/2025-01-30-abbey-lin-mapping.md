0:09 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I think I spent some time, I feel like our conversation yesterday on S helped unlock some things. So I want to show you what I did overnight that I'm just finishing it up right here too.  That can help kind of explain what needs to be done. So I went through all the content for policies, procedures and training because I know we're missing some content.  So I've pretty much created all the content now that we're missing. And I think we need to organize it in a better way, but then also kind of part of the tool through that process.  Oh yes, let me share the screen. So do you see this? Yeah, I do.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, my one note, right?

1:01 - A L (fortifai.co)
  So I kind of went through, because today's purpose is a G, but I think I might have figured it out, but I'm going to send this to, I've sort of sent it to Yvonne to look at.  like, so this is just the organization of the policy in terms of like, on the front page of our app, you know, there's some, there's different types of document needing administration document to send to the organization.  I'm just telling him which documents should go into which of the sections, because right now it's wrong, right? But, does that make sense or?  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, like this one right now, these are all ISO documentations, but it's listed under document management administration.  It should actually be in the ISO section, you know, how we broke it off as like documents that need employee signature documents for internal and then ISO.  I can, I don't know if you've seen that. So I'm just kind of telling him where certain documents are.  example, like the human rights All of these should be at the documents needing sign off and then all the other documents should go into that administration and that there's no ISO needed here.  And then say like, gee, saying like the code of conduct employees sign off and then the rest of them need to document administration.  But then I go to, to the policies. So I created all of the policies. That we're kind of missing in here.  And I've also created the quarterly communication because that was also missing in the app so that they can put, put the actually the right communication in there.  And I've created all of them kind of missing policies that were there and the code of conduct. So, so they can add that to the tool there.  And then same with social because in social we didn't have anything at all. So I've created the human rights training along with like all the additional policies there.  So then maybe it's easier if I just show you the app here. So you see the app here, the content area here, the policies like S, there is no policies here right now, right?  So I've created all the policies and said where they should go here.

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then same with environment, right?

3:36 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Like these documents are in the wrong area, so they should actually be in this area.

3:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm talking about that.

3:44 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And then for governance, we don't have that many policies. So I've redone the policies and added more that they could put in there.  And so it's the same thing with training. We didn't have any kind of training for environment. So I've created environmental training so that can  please go in there. And then for governance, I've kind of updated the trainings for that. And then same within the content area.  If you see here, there is, I've created content for G, S, and E is already created. So I created it for S and G.  At least now we have like real content that should actually go in our tool so that can be launched.  that was missing for our launch, right? Because we didn't have any basic template policies. And then the thing we need to do is put the basic, all those templates into the tool.  So that could be their starting point. And then if they have any specific policies, we can add into that there.

4:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. So can we perhaps update those, that spreadsheets? Just to...

4:49 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, we can do that. Okay. But I think that's mainly for the policies, procedures, and trainings, but yes.

5:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, just make sure. to be sure, we have policies, procedures. Are these updated? Okay, let's... So now we have stuff for the S or no?  It should be yes for all of it.

5:23 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

5:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is also yes?

5:31 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yes. And then same with comms is yes, so...

5:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I would...

5:45 - A L (fortifai.co)
  But I would say no for G risk assessment. Is there specific content ready? There's content in there, but I don't think it's ready.

5:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

6:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, so for controls we don't have or I'm not sure I that's well controls we don't that's the one that's like I realized we also forgot one of the controls for e around the asset management but no like the the thing that you have in like magenta that's what Romeo needs to create all right like the so there's a okay that's about the forms correct yeah okay and we have do we have all the forms we're missing I think one form the one that like the employee feedback one I just need to give you that but I think we might be missing maybe like even the asset management but this is what I say like think it could be good to like kind of map out that I think you did do that right like part of the mapping out of it but um yeah and there's not many controls for for us there's like a lot of the controls are actually the same ones as G  which is a whistle-blowing hotline, a lot of the S is within the third-party process.

7:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so just to let this one by one, regarding controls on the E, we are...

7:19 - A L (fortifai.co)
  We need to create the new forms.

7:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Forms. Forms. Anything until for one.

7:32 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yes.

7:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Regarding the S on controls.

7:40 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I don't think there are any specific ones for S, so maybe it's not relevant.

7:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

7:49 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, and for the G? The G is done as long as you finish that one middle slide, right? And the new updated design.  That's a yes.

8:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I guess, I mean, this is really important to me. When we say content, I think a lot of our conversations, not just ours, but in the company, I think they sometimes revolve around just making sure we're talking about the same thing.  So I think it would be useful to have fixed definitions for things. When I think about content, what I'm thinking about is just pure text information that will go into something, right?  Yeah. Are you familiar with the markdown, like the text markdown?

8:43 - A L (fortifai.co)
  No.

8:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. So it's just a way of formatting that's, anyway, it's very bare bones, any computer can read it because it's very, very bare bones, right?  So it's not about how the lady is formatted. It's really just about the content. So when I talk about content, what I think about is the information that will go  inside the design, right? And once we have the design for one of them, then we have the different contents and that design can be just instantiated for the different contents, right?  And we don't need to redesign the thing, we just put the content in there, it's randomized in that way.  When you say content, do you mean like the finished page, like the finished visual page? No, I mean the text that goes in there.  So in that case, this section here, the last section, is really just about the pure text, right? So we do have the content, we just don't have the slide here, right?  But the slide is not...

9:45 - A L (fortifai.co)
  The slide has some content that hasn't been created.

9:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

9:54 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And at the same time, I realize in the tool, they haven't... They haven't copied all the content in into the controls like like I just clicked on it with a potential customer for like that set expenses and I clicked on the form and then it went to conflict of interest.  So they just did the outside title but they actually haven't put the behind the forms and I'm wondering if it's because they're waiting for something from Romeo or not but we should ask about that part.  Okay. But they should have the content temperature and create that content at least the initial forms of it, but they haven't updated it.  Yeah.

10:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is this is why I'm trying to put links to stuff here. Yeah, because it's. I think that right now there's a lot of friction between like do I have the right thing is the latest version.  This is the right information is no information is spread out. And I think that that just increases the surface area for mistakes.  The more single sources of truth. We can have the better. So third party regarding the content, just a text, no design, how are we on that?

11:10 - A L (fortifai.co)
  The third party, I think I just created the contents. I think it's done. Well, it depends on what you talk about third party.  So third party policy trainings and communication. I would almost add next to ES and G, there's a third party one.  And we need to figure out, because if you think about, and I have to think about where this goes in our tool, Because there's internal communication policies.  I want my internal person to read about anti bribery and corruption, right? But part of the third party management process is to ensure your partners also understand your policies.  So they need to read the supplier code of conduct and your expectations of it. They need to do your training that you created, right?  So does that sit in the policies procedures training and you're just deploying it to a third party? Or does it just sit in the third party section where there's a section for them where they need third party like policies procedure trainings?  Right, and then there's a whole mother section after the policies procedures training is that questionnaire and that questionnaire is I kind of that process that That like that on yeah, so it's actually like We've narrowed down you are a high-risk supplier the top 30 40 percent now You need to sign off on our supplier code of conduct So we need to send it to you or you're a higher risk and now you need to do our training So we need you to confirm the training now like you know We want to be proactive and every quarter give you communication that you need to sign off on that you've received like so it kind of goes like That same internal process that you're doing with your employees also should be going with your third parties And whether or not that sits within policies training and communications that one or it trades within the third party box  That's part of the third-party requirement, along with the questionnaire and the filtering, the things that we have. Mm-hmm.

13:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, before we create a, we can create, we can always create a new column. But before we get into that, can we see how these things connect on the boxes and arrows?  Yeah. Because if you start to write once, we guarantee consistency in the app, right? okay, so now we are discussing third-party, right?

13:43 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And it's the same concept with risk assessment too, right? Like, it was like a slightly different. So third-party and risk assessment, it goes across ES and G.  Do you know what I mean? Mm Like you said, one questionnaire ideally. that covers ES and G, then you think about, okay, security and privacy is another one, right?  But like in our app, ideally you're not having like three different processes for third party, for environment, social and governance, because they should all be together, right?  Whereas policies and procedures, you can kind of separate it into ES and G, right? But then like, because you could say, I'm only gonna do the G part, but if you only do the G part with the third parties, it's pretty much the same, but you wouldn't have the S or the E content, right?  If you have the policy. it's kind of like the third part, same with risk assessment, right? If you're gonna do a risk assessment, you'll try to do ES and G risk assessment together, rather than one risk assessment for E, one risk assessment for S, one risk assessment for G.

14:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct, which is why I think that, remember when we discussed the idea of atomizing the question, like separating the questions, and then we can group them in different ways.  Yeah.

14:59 - A L (fortifai.co)
  So I think,

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I this is why we need to do it, because, like, I'm here on the mirror. Okay, let's say I have...  I need to extend the room for a second.

15:30 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I'm I'm

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you okay okay so let's imagine the process of third-party management right so in questions like this question question one question two question three four five six right and some of those questions what do you mean the questions in the process we ask for different kinds of information right like in the forums or we ask for documents we collect information right what part of the process are you talking about where we would collect the information so if I'm like for instance the Anya's process she said oh we are trying to get this new supplier in right and they need to know about how they handle some DEI right we are we are getting information from them right yeah I think eventually there's different types of processes but yes I guess eventually you will need to add a question like certain suppliers will need to get a question

20:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yes, yeah, but it's not really about the questionnaire.

20:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just like we need to know something from them And there's ways of knowing that one of those ways is asking them and other ways checking the Dow Jones and other ways to Ask for the document the point is that they have something that we do not have they have some information There's some information about them that we need to have right And we there's many ways many channels to get through this information But it's basically about this piece of information that we need right So I just called it question, but the more Fundamental notion of a question right so in the third-party management Process there's a few questions we need to answer pieces of information We need to collect right and some of them are related to e Some are related to s some are related to g right and the point is we When we separate our platform just by this stuff  or this stuff, or this stuff, we get all these, we get this process cut up. Like we get one and two, we get three and four, and we get six and five.  Anyway, you get my point. And the way to, I believe the way to think about this is not to think about visual sections.  The way to plan this tool is not to think about visual sections on Figma, is to think about the pieces of information and where they will be.  Because if we have these pieces of information described on a spreadsheet of ours, the client doesn't have to see it, okay?  This is not about using spreadsheets, it's just a way of thinking. If we have them in the spreadsheet of ours, we can then create views on it, right?  And you can say, oh, this question is about E, S, so this question is about E, question is about S.  questions about G and then we can order them and get all the pieces of information to create a report that is related to G for instance, right?  Is this making sense?

22:21 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but I guess I've kind of done that in our tool. We have like sections that are E questions, that are S questions and sections that are G questions.

22:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, but the thing is, but now we have this situation where we're thinking that there are aspects of the website that they would need another area, the ones that are traversal to it, right?  So when you suggested that maybe we need another column here, it was for the third party, right?

23:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  It was because of the content for the third party.

23:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because the content for the third party, it touches on all of the different aspects, right?

23:15 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because there's also policies, trainings, and communications in third party, but that can also just be within the third party box.  If you think about the usage of a compliance officer, you have one section for policy, training, communication for internal, and then they might like, okay, I need to now engage with my suppliers.  Do I go into the third party box? Because all of my things that I engage with the suppliers are there, so it's easy for me to like, okay, policies, trainings, and there, and do I do it there?  Or do I, you know, go in and policies, training, communication, and have another box called for external people? And I know that, like, I'm working with nice suppliers, and then I have to go back to this policies, training, and communication box, send it out, and then go back into my, you know, my third party one to be able to manage the rest of process.  Mm-hmm.

23:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have policies. I'll call it PCT, policy comes in training and we have them internal and we have them external, right?  So if we navigate the site via policy, we would need to see a section that lets us filter for internal versus external.  Is that it?

24:30 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, possibly or just have another section, you know how we have like the ISO section in the bottom to say external ones.

24:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

24:41 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

24:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So third party, third party would have to be spread out across the other things, the comms, the training, the policy and the risk assessment.  Is that it? Mm-hmm.

25:01 - A L (fortifai.co)
  If you think about risk assessment, I don't know how do you want to complicate it, but you have to do a risk assessment within the third party, but the risk assessment that we have up there is like a standard double materiality risk assessment a company does like that, but like within the third party management process you'd need to do a smaller risk assessment, right?  So it's like what we have in our current third party, you know, take out the top 30% or 2 to 35% you spend, know, do a risk-based approach in terms of where their geography is at, you know, and then you do a risk assessment to try to bring down the number of suppliers that you actually have to deal with, right?  That's also a risk assessment, it's like a risk filtering, I don't know if you want to change the name of it, but that process also needs to happen within the third party process.  So there's kind of like an order it's like first like I was just talking with Eleanor about this this afternoon right because you can you can make a third or third-party risk management super complex or you can make it super easy right?  I'm always on the side of making it super easy because I've seen super complex ones are super hard to actually integrate in the business because you end up having like thousands of suppliers you need to do risk assessments on and there's no capacity for that right?  so the way that I've created mine is to be very like light-hearted way of doing something but not like super deep right?  And then Eleanor is actually trying to go from super complex to super and so it's kind of like the first step is just to understand which out of all of your supplier base which ones are the top 30 that are riskiest you know and you look at spend you look at geography you look at type of business whatever and you come with this 30 list that you've already pre kind of pre...  understand I understand. And based off of that, you send the questionnaire, ES and G questionnaire, they come back with it or some kind of risk tiering makes them a higher risk, and then you need to do some things like set up a meeting for them to take the training, they have to sign off on the communication, they have to commit on the policies.  Or you can just say like these top 30, it doesn't matter how they respond to the questionnaire, all of these top 30s need to respond and write back to our policy, like, you know, confirm our policy.  Or they might say, I want all 100 just to confirm our policy, they don't need to do a training, you know, and communicate.  Like there's like different things, but policy training communication is a remediation or a control for part of this process.  And then the other part, which we haven't built in our school is like, like a meeting, like oftentimes you have to follow up with a meeting, and then there's some tasks in the meeting being like, do this, this and this, like follow up on training, do this and this.  And that task management we haven't built yet. So there's no content around that. But that's also what what Anya was saying was one of her her challenges is that these things they come to do and then everyone forgets about the to do is after that.  No, I'm aware of that.

28:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  understand that my my my difficulty is not the business case. My difficulty is how things connect in a way that is sustainable in terms of the platform not becoming too complex and to like we solve This is the Yeah, if we really if we do the platform piecemeal It's at some point something that the the last thing to be done will the least well done thing because there's so many path dependency on the way It's called the other things, right?  So we should do the more complex stuff first. Otherwise the more complex stuff Gets too framed within the other things that already exist.  I agree. I agree with that. Okay. So what what I'm thinking is I The sections, they describe the topic area and the process, right?  You said it because of the risk assessments and then you, like, you figure out what's happening and then you put out information and train people and then you check out if they're doing those things and then you do the other thing and the reporting and so on, right?

29:27 - A L (fortifai.co)
  It's kind of like that. Okay.

29:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And where it gets confusing is where we need to integrate things that are both sequential and transversal, right? the third party.  And risk assessment.

29:43 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Probably auditing and reporting also because it's going to go across to you, right? Yeah.

29:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But auditing and reporting, in my opinion, they, there are ways of doing them that are not so, so scary.  Yeah, like pulled. So for risk assessments, what you're telling me is that risk assessment maybe is not so much about the ESG is just about, okay, so the easy solution is to not have ESG, share, is there any password link security?  No, I'm in it. Okay, so I'll just bring you to me and they'll just form. So the easy, Are you I think I just pulled you into me.  There you are.

31:04 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's not separate ESG For for risk Right yeah, I'm not like it's like How do I say this like I Really the risk process like this process will be the same even though for ISO is actually quite a little bit different for the environment But the reason why I've always separated it for ES and G Which I don't like but at the reality it is is that you you get some companies being like I've already done the G But I need to do the E and so I only want the E and the S part, you know Like I've already done the E so I only want the S and the G part so it's like a way to kind of separate like eventually I was saying this to also to Yvonne is that eventually ideally maybe we even lock it, know, so people can't see across ES and G.  They just see the and that they bought right and then they only see like g and third parties you know s and third parties but look if it can be like you just take out like the s and the e part but the process is still the same right like exactly like it's something like that and i like then you only you then it's very clear what you're sold and right now we're kind of toggling between because companies but there hasn't been one company that wants all e s e s and g like you know you've heard them someone e someone s someone g and so i want to kind of break it down into its own like you order this you get this you order this you get any and that but i i think it's i mentioned this to evan but i think we're just like trying to develop this first launch first but i think eventually we need to other companies do this like you only want the gdpr one you get that you know you only want this one you lock it in there but um yeah so the toggles need to happen i guess yeah um so there's two aspects about that one is that i think i don't know if it's my place to say this but i'll risk it i think we need to be more proactive in deciding who we are serving

33:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because as a small company, we have so many challenges stacked against us that trying to do all the things cannot be the way.  I don't think no one has ever pulled this off. So it's a matter of what are we deciding not to do and either we decide to do vertically.  We do everything for the E or we decide to do it horizontally. We do the full process for risk assessment.  It's very difficult to do both dimensions. Because this is our struggle, right? To look at the alignment and the rework and design and the open loops that are done but not really done and we need to revisit.  A lot of it is about context switching. We start doing this thing but then we have this conversation with this client that is not exactly our ICT but they have interesting...  So I think every time the longer we stay without making that difficult decision saying, you know what? This is either for Acre or for Cognite.

34:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And I think it's going to be just so much harder to keep track of things.

34:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I agree.

34:07 - A L (fortifai.co)
  But I think our, how do I say it that like, I don't think that's exactly the problem that we have yet.  I think that will be a problem as we go. I think the problem that we had, because like they haven't, we haven't changed too much for them.  Okay, yes, we kind of move like the grouping hydro rain, but that was always in my head that I wanted to change that grouping.  Because if you think about our context, we started like, listen, we really restarted with eggs design, like we found them September is when they started and came in, right?  And they created the first compliance map and like, really like, you know, within a month we threw in the whole structure that you see, you know, risk assessment management, whatever, other than audit and reporting, right?  And then, and then we started building it in October. And then they phased out in November. So, and then you guys came in in November and then we tried to build it.  I think the fundamental problem is that we have. and we've never took the time to actually see what is supposed to be in each of these sections.  What is the content? What is actually risk assessment? Does the flow actually even work for what we're trying to do?  We're just like, we're so fast with eggs, being like, this is a typical risk assessment. Let's throw it together.  But we didn't actually click through it with our customers to even say if it actually worked. And this is what we're testing out now, right?  So it's like, a lot of this context switching is more like, let's go back and fix the part we never finished.  And we need to go back and fix that and then bring it to the customers to test. I think that's where we're like, needed like, we could have like, a way that we could have worked with eggs is like, let's just get really policies training communications perfect and done that, right?  But that made it really hard for me to sell when I would go out, you know, and then they'll be like, where's your tool?  And it's like, here's one part of it. Like, at least I can like, fake click at a risk assessment.  And I like, you know, the other boxes that had some kind of content. I understand. I understand the reasons why it is.  Yeah.

35:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now, like, now this is why I wanted it

36:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  You involved in everyone else is like we need to go back and actually what are we trying to do?  How do we actually make it work so it goes across for the people that we want to serve right?  And that's why you know like going back and unlocking these pieces I think will help us better understand what we're building and and why because I don't necessarily feel that We're like like the reason why I'm willing to take Anya's process for third party or some other ones It's because we haven't built out one one that we could be like no don't do this It's more like okay if we need to go and think about rebuilding like one all the way that actually works Let's take in the input from all the other people and then try to build and that works So I don't necessarily think we're changing it totally for them but I want to be surprised if like we have to make that decision with like telenoor who's coming in now and like they might join our tool and like Like smaller subsidiaries might join our tool not their headquarters But like then how much do we tailor for them or not and how much are they willing to pay us to do this?  Right like telenoor is only one that has a huge budget. That's willing to pay ochre is not willing to pay it, right?  So I think these are the things that we need to decide. But I think I'm aligned in that we need to keep it simple and we need to not say yes to everything.  So I think it's that. But I think it's hard to draw the line when we don't know what we're building.  And I think that's where I appreciate your strengths and kind of like, OK, how do you map out the process in your head to see what we are actually building and what we can build and not, right?  And so I think that's yeah. So yeah, so I agree with you. We have to get to a point where we don't end up building something too crazy, but I think we need to have a starting point where we show it to them and then they give an input, right?

37:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yes, yes, we need to have something to show them for sure, for sure. And I'm not trying to be difficult or anything.  I think you realize that. But it's just that, for instance, if we had decided or if we decide, hey, this thing is just for digital companies.  Hacker, let's just, this is, we are in the, in the thoughts and box, right? There's no consequences. So Hacker, Hacker friends, thank you for so much, but we've realized that for our business, we need to pursue something else, right?  Let's imagine this conversation difficult one to have. But, and then we, we say, we are moving into digital first companies that are really, they have a really strong pain point regarding CSRD, right?  And they don't need, you know, all of these other stuff. they would pay us, I don't know, 10,000 euro.  I have no idea to get CSRD ready, right? And we get 10, 20 companies doing this. This would prove that there's a need for, for this stuff.  And it would bring the difficult, difficult positioning conversations to the forefront, which is much better.

39:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  then afterwards we have like a whole thing made up and people say oh this is not I see that nice but it's not exactly what I do right yeah yeah so okay so in terms of so in terms of and I think that's what we are doing that job like we have a business development I'm targeting digital companies so the more that we can get in like cognite art off all of them more of those that come in we can kind of shove the other ways around but until we get enough of that business development in we need to keep everybody kind of juggling a little bit because like in order to get the seed around our investor as Ray said we need to convert like 250 thousand dollars which is like 20 to 30 customers we have like 15 now so it's like at one point we need to kind of juggle a little bit until we figure out which ones we can cut and which ones we can't and that's just this weird period in between like while we do our tool and try to keep everyone happy and then eventually once we get enough money we could be like okay screw you we're not taking you right like  But we're in the kind of in-between period where like we're we're really on the Neat, it's kind of like I feel like we're in the point where we're not totally scalable You know how they say sometimes I do things that don't scale in the beginning like we're Point of not doing things that scale to make these 12 companies happy And then once we have the ability then we go and scale right like we don't have the luxury yet to be able to cut out Some of these you know, but I do think we can set boundaries like you know Like I did with like with ochre carbon capture like are you gonna do an API?  No, we're not you know, you can set some boundaries But there's some that we did to be like, okay, you want this like file tailored this way Okay fine We'll do it as long as we need to convert right like There is a point but then the next one's that after that then we don't do it for that, right?

40:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's a little bit of a balance there that we need to manage Got it Let's I understand I get it so The most useful thing for now would be to understand our third party and risk assessments relate to  the SNG. So what we've explored here is the possibility that for them there's no toggle, right? For a third party, yeah.

41:14 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I think inside of it there could be a toggle like when you do the questionnaire or like your risk part on what you need to manage.  I'm confused.

41:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we have a toggle or we don't have a toggle?

41:42 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I don't think we need a toggle, but there will be like filtering, I guess. If you do a risk assessment only like without E, then you don't need to have E questions and stuff.  So. Got it.

41:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So no toggle. but no page-wide toggle.

42:10 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Like, don't even think we should have the toggle. Like, I kind of like regret having the toggle. Like, I think it's like if people buy G, then they see G.  If they see S, they do the S, like, but um, but yeah, that's uh, like, I think we should like, or like E is grayed out or something like that, so then they see they can go into it or that or like some kind of upsell process in between then.  But I do, I feel like this toggle in between like, it's a little bit confusing.

42:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, to me, to me, yeah, it makes sense to what you're saying that the toggle, the toggle creates silos, right?

42:55 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because at one point there's not like, well, the EU saw there's like 10 policies. That was the problem.  We had toggles because of your ES and G policies are going to have like 30 policies that you're dealing with on one page.  So the toggle kind of filtered it a little bit, but maybe there's a better way to filter it. know?

43:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah. There's like, we can prototype that right now. I'm opening Figma, share this tab, and of course we're doing the test, so the point is not fidelity, it's just to express an idea, but I think there's ways to do it.  So just a second, this regard, the content of this table is not about the content of this table, but the table as a kind of component is a very useful one, right?  we could just list all the policies in the table and filter them here, just ESG. Yeah. And that solves everything about the logo.  Yeah, that could be.

44:09 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And I think it's also easier to maintain. Yeah.

44:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And people understand this. People already know how to handle filters. Yeah, yeah.

44:18 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I'm done for that, actually. If we want to try to have, you know, draw one out for the policies, I don't know how much of a change that will be for the development team, though, given where we are.  yeah.

44:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I suspect, I wouldn't know. suspect that not too much. It's just that there's a little bit of a sunk cost fallacy.  a lot of energy was invested in the other way. But I think converting into this way will make everything from now easier to manage.  Yeah. But it is valuable to discuss with. Ivan, or you could maybe have that way.

44:55 - A L (fortifai.co)
  could have Romeo try drawing something and seeing because we have to think like dog and then that like, yeah, filter documents needing, know, yeah, documents, like internal documents, document wide ISO documents, and then you can like, yeah, filter for all of those.

45:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I mean, creating the point is creating the table visually. It's not the difficult thing. Actually, none of this is really difficult, but the most the point that of most leverage for this is not to design the Figma of the table is to figure out which columns you do we want on the table, right?  That's where we realize what things are possible to do on the table. And I think that's an even discussion.  Because then the design of the table is like self-evident. can just make that really quickly. But I think that if we do it in that way, we can, you can do away with the page right toggle, right?  Yes. And if you like, if you are a compliance officer and you have multiple initiatives going on. You can just filter them by, oh, I want to see what's happening on the E and S.  I don't want to see the G right now, or I can just see what's about to expire, what's on track, you know, I think the table is like our best friend.  I really like tables, as you can see on this thing. So, yeah, this would be a decent way, I think of.

46:25 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I think we could also, we're so close to launch, I would be like, I would almost say let them test it as is, but create this prototype.  then when we talk with our, maybe, even like on Figma, and then when we test it with our users, and say, yes, now you've tried it, there's toggling, but we actually think filtering might be better.  Do you think that, and then fix it for the control round? I just don't think we'll be able to fix it in a week, right?

46:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, sure, let's not, let's, I think it's much better to really nail this down than just interrupt. them on this final stretch, let them do the thing, and then perhaps experiment with this.  Because, and I think this is really important in my opinion, is that, come to think of it, I think there's like four actions or four main verbs around everything that we do here, right?  We have data collection, and this means collecting the acknowledgement on policies, the approval, forms, documents, you know, there's all sorts of different motions for data collection, but they are around data collection, right?  And these things can be for like internal and external, know, but basically this is about data collection. We need a way of managing the audience, means internal and external, like the groups, and I might send you  this policy to everyone, am I sending this to externals? We need to have a way of knowing who we are talking to.  And we need to have a way of tracking what's happening. And this means deadlines, status, upcoming stuff, stuff like this.  And you need to have a way of reporting these things, right? If the first three things are good, the report is pretty much just generate something in the back end and the PDF comes out.

48:34 - A L (fortifai.co)
  It's really easy.

48:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the thing is that we didn't know this because we were still designing the platform, all of us. But we have elements of these things across all sections, right?  So the training, for instance, I don't know, is this useful to go down this rabbit hole, or your project?

48:54 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I think that's fine. I think that's whatever also helps you feel like you're onboarded and understand our system, too.

49:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, okay, PCT, right? PCT, we need to... data collects for policy. We need to approve and we need to acknowledge.  We need to manage audience to approve and acknowledge, right? We need to track both approve and acknowledge, right? And we need to report both things as well.  So, actually, this thing is basically, it's not the visual but the idea, the metaphor. Oh, sorry, I'm down here.

49:52 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, I'll keep that.

49:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the metaphor for this is a form. It doesn't have to look like a form, but that's the way we think about it.  The metaphor for this is a mailing list. The metaphor for this is a to-do list. And the metaphor for this, I don't, I never know if it's a metaphor or an analogy, but the last one is, well, really just to report, it's just a lot, maybe.  Yeah, a lot, yeah. And I think if you think about in these terms, everything kind of falls into it.  what can be confusing is that when we don't realize, oh, are we collecting information or are we managing tasks, right?  I think it's both.

50:49 - A L (fortifai.co)
  We're managing tasks and collecting. I think there's like the data analytics, right? That's like what is missing and the digitalization for most of these people, right?  part of the forms is just... I think the forums was also going to get data analytics, which we haven't built out the dashboard yet, but I see that is an important part to like monitor the progress and then the to-do list, right?  Like, we actually haven't driven, like, actually that's not even on our list. We should add it to that table is that the dashboard page kind of forgotten about it, but that's supposed to be like a conglomerate of everything that's happening.  And you have like an open source dashboard and the to-do list. Yeah, exactly.

51:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly. But I think the dashboard is special. The dashboard is really easy to do once we have the data, right?  Because there's like components and standards and patterns that you can just say, oh, we want to show data about completion.  The best way to do that is with a pie chart, you know, but that's easy to make. There's like JavaScript libraries for that.  So, okay, if this makes sense, we just tested it out with PCT, right? Let's test it out with a risk assessment just to make sure if it works.  I'll change the color and risk assessment will be blue. So when we do data collection on the risk assessments, yeah, this doesn't work.  I will not overlap them. When we do data collection on risk assessments, what we're getting is information about our risks, right?  So it's still kind of a form, in a way. It's a questionnaire, I think, yes.

52:39 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but conceptually, it's a questionnaire.

52:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and we need to manage the audience, which means the people we ask internally. Yeah. Okay, and we need to track, and that also means a to-do list, we ask people done it.

53:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  to the list and when it comes to reporting it's also kind of a log like on Monday Simon sent us this information you know something like that so it so far this seems to be really kind of helpful so in terms of yeah go ahead go ahead no no no I was saying yeah no that is very like it is like a database manager and one thing and for all of these is that and maybe it doesn't need to be here but all of these is we are instructing people how to do it right and that's kind of the key that's missing oftentimes in all and all the processes it's like how do you do a risk assessment we walk you through it and then we give you the tools to do it right same thing like policies procedures trainings what is a anti-bribery policy oh here we give you the template so you can do it and deploy it so I think it's more semantic but it's kind of like there should be like an extra box thing like explanation or something because that is like a key part of our tool I'm going to get a private charger

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you. So maybe we are mixing, mixing. We have a questionnaire but also a little bit of information, education on it, right?  Yeah.

54:50 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Okay.

54:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for every section, Okay. So now we have a mental model of how this works. think this seems to be a mental model that is robust enough to be adaptable for multiple use cases, right?  So I'm satisfied with this. Is there anything else you want to explore?

55:20 - A L (fortifai.co)
  No, I think it's like, like, like what I'm kind of eager to do is break down that third party.  So it's a functioning one that the team can develop, right? Like that's kind of what we're missing now for some of these key ones.  Like control, we kind of helped it, but it's not all the way down. I think we're missing a few things.  Also, I realized we're missing probably the asset management register too. so, but I feel like that will come also maybe when Romeo starts designing those two.  So then we could be like, okay, we're missing this and this. But then there also has to be like a process of like, what should third party look like?  This is what we have right now. You know, does it make sense? What are the flows that we're missing?  So that the, you know, UX UI design, including like the one that we want to hire starts, they have like a list of things that they can start working on, right?  That's kind of my, my, I guess, like immediate want is like some of these ones that we haven't like on your chart that we haven't, that we haven't built out, right?  Like third party, even like audit report, like third party and risk management, I feel like those will need some like some time to get it right.  Like some decision and breakdown of the process. Got it.

56:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's try to detail it a little bit more. So I enter.

56:47 - A L (fortifai.co)
  So with the process that we have, right? And kind of like, say like, okay, the process that we have in figma and the process that we have already developed.  I feel like it's 40% of what needs to be done. Right. And can we design the rest of the parts so that it's ready when the development team is ready to move, Mike?  Yeah, that's it.

57:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I'm on the Figma pulling out the... Okay, so this is what we have for risk assessment.

57:30 - A L (fortifai.co)
  This is the NTA part. This is the old one. So there should be a risk assessment. No, there should be a third party.  I think you're... That eggs did. I don't know where eggs prototype stuff is. Because we have a developed... We have part of it developed.  There must be some Figma for that.

57:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll just log into... our platform and see what we have and we use that as a source of truth, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, can you show this there?

58:20 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, so I don't know if it's going to be there because remember that you disabled it but I can give you this slack it's in the design it's in the design it's true it's true it's true it's in the design one I think so risk assessment yes third party management you can click on third party management well that's risk assessment we should go to third party first so I know that yeah and this isn't actually where you start if you scroll down it's because it's been reset like it hasn't been reset but go down to set third party management setup that one on the bottom and then expand it like that's actually this page right now you would walk into this one but I think because we went to the second page they kind of which is  that, but this is the first page right now and how you would walk into it.

59:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

59:09 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so just like, I don't know, I would maybe read through this just like as a first eye. I need to put this away so maybe you look, read through the setup guide and see if it makes sense for you or whether or not we need to redo it in a different way.  If we look at the directions, because that's like a third-party management process, but it's not the prettiest or UX design, I'll be right back.

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay, so this. Okay. So, let's see, let's see. These things will stop. Okay. So, the exit. So I'm trying to design it as to draft it as we go so what what I have on the left side is just to make sure we keep it consistent is the policies because it is a style that we will probably using.

1:01:29 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, this probably hasn't been updated with the one too, yeah.

1:01:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have the no toggle, we have some stats regarding Okay, the third party list makes sense, right? And also, because there are different kinds of third parties, we could have the same table for all of them and just list them as a type thing and say, oh, it's a vendor or is a supplier.  You know, we could have the same table for all of them and then use filters again.

1:02:30 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think we could do that, too.

1:02:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, this is useful, right? We also need to add a new one that would need like a button, add new, right?  And the button to add a new one would need to have, sorry, my pen just, come on, come on.  It's not the pen, it's the Miro app. So, when we have a new one, we can ask them, oh, what kind of new one is a vendor, is a supplier, is a business partner, something like that, okay?  And based on that, it takes us to different forms, right? Yeah.

1:03:22 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Does it make sense? you agree with this? Yeah, but I, yes, but I feel like if we want to do like the very Toyota version, like everyone can have the same questionnaire, like it's not like too different, like it's like, do you have a human rights policy?  You know what I mean? it's like, if you want to get into the Mercedes, then you start giving them like really detailed questionnaires, differences and that.  But I would say for the really light version, you can give everyone the same.

1:03:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, in that case, I would suggest still keeping the same buttons, but just take it to the same form.

1:03:57 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay? Yeah.

1:03:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And people feel in and eventually they appear here as you know updated on something right and probably I should be able to see on the table I should be able to see just a second just a second like I say okay okay let's use this example I have someone there and I click the three buttons I click here and I see one of those menus with options right and I could probably send them stuff right I don't know  stuff, but there's probably some way of sending a message, sending an to them, our internal message.

1:05:06 - A L (fortifai.co)
  on our tool itself, I know there was at least one point there where you can click on it and then it opens up.  Have you seen that? Like that functionality of the thing you might see, it might actually be there already. This thing, this thing, right?  Yeah, that thing, yeah. And then ESG status, I create tasks to do notes. And I don't know what the ESG status is, that might be the answer to their questionnaire maybe.  Uh-huh.

1:05:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, my device. Wait, wait. Oh yeah, I'm going to be there. Here, I close my device. Here. Okay, it's here.  Yes, so when you click there. We can see this stuff, which is useful. I'll just leave this and this page is very useful.  Because okay, we can have notes, nice. We have the change log, nice.

1:06:16 - A L (fortifai.co)
  It could be things that you need to do like tasks, send them a training or like follow up on different things, have them sign off on the code of conduct.  I don't know if that should be in this part or should be in another part that you just link it, all of those that show up there.

1:06:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, yeah, this is pretty good actually. already done. Okay. This is the other bits. Okay. We also have this create the task for them, right?  I didn't show it here. We already have this, so I create task for them, right? Sorry, Arita?

1:07:19 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, no, I'm there. Yeah, I create task.

1:07:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, so this is almost done. It's really the only thing we need is the.

1:07:28 - A L (fortifai.co)
  I mean, the one thing you might be eating is like, OK, let they like there has to be like a section where you like, or maybe it's here, like where you have meeting notes, like with somebody, you know, and then, like, I have a meeting with Xiao and we agreed that he's going to review this.  Yeah, I guess we have ad notes there, like code of conduct and stuff there. But maybe it's the directions between there.  That's a little bit missing, like, or something like I just feel like it's a little haphazard in there or.  Like, do people know what they're supposed to do? Like.

1:08:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I would invert this, these things. I think I would open with this and this would be the second because once you have, once you have the information, you don't keep checking this stuff, just do it once, but then you manage the process here, right?  Yeah. So I think this is the main thing and this is the secondary thing. Maybe, yeah.

1:08:35 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

1:08:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so by doing this, and then I think we could change names around here. I don't know what to call it, but maybe there's something to be done there around copy.

1:08:50 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yes.

1:08:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  with this, I think we have the, with this stuff plus the form, we need to have the form. We have the primitives for the third.  Okay. And now, to make things a little bit more clear, I'll just draft it from scratch. We have third-party and our third-party, sorry, I need to zoom out, on the iPad it doesn't track.  I need to find a better way of doing this. So we are in the third-party and the third-party has some stats.  How many have been sent out?

1:09:29 - A L (fortifai.co)
  How many questionnaires have been sent out? Or how many responses or something like that? Exactly.

1:09:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have the avenue, right? We have the... But then there should be some...

1:09:41 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Because even before they get there, there are some directions, right, that they need to follow to be able to get to that first page of directions.  Or maybe that's in the stats part in that page.

1:09:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I understand what you're saying. That education part, guess, isn't it? So, what I'm thinking is this, we have this, we can't put the instructions when you add a new one, right?  And we have a pet, we are developing a pattern for this, which was for the policies, remember?

1:10:18 - A L (fortifai.co)
  We call it the interstitial.

1:10:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then this takes you to the, to the form, right? Okay. We can also check the details and the details look like details.  They look like that thing over there. Just, and the details, we have head task, note, we have some interactions, something like this.  It also has like a third party information registry, I don't know, something like this, right? So there's like, oh, name, person, that kind of thing, right?  So this is the flow for the third party. We move, we can see all the third parties, we can add them, we can see some information about them, about what we are about to do, the process we are about to do.  Then we get into this easy selection to figure out what kind of third party we're dealing with. At this stage, we do not have different forms, but that's a very easy thing to do in the future.  So we just take them to the forum, which needs to be designed.

1:11:52 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Well, we do have a forum. If you see the inside our tool, we have a questionnaire already. Yeah, but it needs to be updated, right?  You expect something like this, yeah.

1:12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think to be We didn't pop it into your murals it shows that if there is something there, but I think it needs to be okay Okay, this also needs to be updated I suppose well, I mean we don't need to create work if that's not necessary There's like small changes here so the brand of needs to be done is This The form This this is mainly the The that is the least done.  think And just small changes small changes here Right so if we do these things focusing on Keeping the same stand the same patterns Including a lot of information for people to know what they're about to getting to We can we can solve the  the third party, right? Without the toggle at the top. Yeah.

1:13:05 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay. I think so. But I think like, yeah, after they respond to the questionnaire or missing something, like they respond to the questionnaire, depending on if it's a good response, then you can close it.  If there isn't, there should be like some kind of step, then you need to like have a meeting with them and then send a training and do something else.  So like, I don't know, where like after they fill in the questionnaire, what happens, I guess, do we go into another dashboard where they can be like, these are high flags, these are low flags, these are whatever.  then like, and then maybe all the one high flags like we press a button, send a training or whatever reminder, all the low flags, put a one year reminder to recheck again or something.  But I feel like there's something missing after the questionnaires go out. So let's go through that.

1:13:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They fill in. questionnaire right yeah if good that's not really anything to it's just more like a reminder to check in two years that will be the risk you know so bad bad they should be on some kind of list where we need to do some additional things with them exactly so there's different kinds of bad let's say they sent insufficient information yeah need to be able so this means that we need to be able as compliance officers to approve their form right yeah I guess review yeah review and approve their form right and I think this is almost like this is like where Anya came in being like okay how do I communicate with them back and forth like it's the portals or something whatever and again

1:15:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  the questions I need for follow-up questions. So maybe it has to be like a communication function on the supplier portal or something like that.

1:15:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we will talk about the way it works, but just the mechanics of it for now. It's a proof, yes, no, right?  So let's say that we need a screen for this. And if they say no, if they say no, we need to send them a message to...

1:15:52 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Clarify questions or something. To clarify, right? Yeah.

1:15:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:16:00 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And then they might get to a point where they answered everything that they can, but it still sucks, right?  So then there needs to be either they need to be added to a risk or a monitor thing where they need to follow up.  They usually have a meeting, right? Jiao, you answered this really poorly, but I can't do anything with it. Then I have a meeting with you, Jiao.  I really like you as a supplier, but in order for you to continue, you need to take our training, you need to sign off on our policy, and you need to implement training within your own organization and give evidence.  And then you'll document that in a meeting, and then you'll have to show, ideally, you'll follow up and show that you've done it by a certain time, and I can check on it, that you've done it, or we kind of have a basis for delisting you.  But that's where usually the process goes wrong, right? It's like, yeah, we have this meeting, yeah, yeah, yeah, do whatever you can take, and then, you know, to stay, and then there's no follow up because there's not a good system to manage the follow up of what you've agreed.

1:16:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, that use case is very clear. So I'm thinking, just again, from the mechanics, if I don't approve, and you find a way of communicating with you preferably inside of the platform, so we keep track of things.  So I should be able to send you some sort of a message. I think the easiest version of doing this is just like a text field, but maybe in the future it's kind of automatically filled in.  And then I send that email to the email.

1:17:18 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so you add something in your box and then there's an email that's sent to the supplier being like, there's a message in your box.  So they get an email and then you, yeah. And the email. And they check, it brings you to their message or something or their supplier portal or something like that.

1:17:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly, the email probably takes you to a place where you can fill in more information. Yeah.

1:17:42 - A L (fortifai.co)
  All right.

1:17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you send again and it goes again to approve. Yes, no.

1:17:51 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

1:17:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I know there's like edge cases to this, but basically, this would solve the problem right now. When something is approved, we need a screen for it, yes, but we also need to include it as a task for the future to review it in next time, right?

1:18:18 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Exactly, yeah, or it could be like on like a list of like green for now, then like when, and then like it goes to, yeah, it changes to yellow or whatever, when you get close that something has to happen.  But that's what, yeah, that's what Anio said, I loved it, like exactly one year later I got a reminder to like send up additional information.

1:18:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly, which fits with that idea that we need some sort of a function that is a little bit of a scheduler, right?

1:18:41 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but that's okay.

1:18:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this task is included somewhere, and we probably can see this task here on the details of that vendor, like if we open the vendor and say, there's a task not yet pending, but probably will be pending in a year.  If we have this task, we can also filter this table, which means this table, we can probably filter it by external people that have tasks pending.  So automatically, not automatically, it would be very easy to know, is anyone missing something? I just go there and I click it and I see it on the same place.  Okay, that's good. Yeah.

1:19:27 - A L (fortifai.co)
  And that's very easy to do.

1:19:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we can also order it in many ways. The moment we have a table, we can do so many things, like we could order it from recurring tasks.  I want to see people that have recurring tasks. I want to see people that have tasks that are not one time, but they are falling behind.  I want to see people with whom I've sent like three or more rounds of requests for information and they still haven't gotten it.  So by having the table, there's two things. that we are doing. First, we are making this information inherently structured, which is useful for, especially, people that are used to spreadsheets, and all of them are.  Also, we are giving them, without telling it, we are giving them an MVP of a reporting section, because they could just take a screenshot of this, which is what people do with complex tools, and put it in their slides, which they will have to do weekly reports.  And they don't want to use the Arriva tool. they just go here and take a screenshot, the screenshot filters, the things that they want to show.  And that's already useful. And then just adding the function of creating a report is almost trivial, think, once we have the data in this way.  So I think have the bones for it. I can just make it more explicit, easy to communicate. Romeo and Ivan.  But yeah, I think we have a process for risk management.

1:21:07 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, okay, cool. No, I think that makes sense. I think the way that you're drawn out, you can see what we're missing in there that needs to be drawn, but it's that a lot of it is there.  It just that's that part in green. I feel like maybe that's the missing, right? Yeah, this doesn't exist.

1:21:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  None of this exists. But I really, I really like the idea of thinking about this primitive and these patterns, because you can see, right?  Once we once we have this, this component, as for more information, we can use it all everywhere. We can use it in a lot of places.  And once we have the component of including a task in the table, we can use it for internal, we can use it for external, we can use it for many, many things.  It's like a concept that is very flexible, not flexible, first of all. And the forms that we already kind of used to form.  So it's also an idea mental model that's useful. So for now, I think that the best way of putting this together would be, yeah, just tidying up this flow.  And that's it. I wouldn't for now explore much more of this, because I think we're bound to, if we spend too much time on it, we're going to mess it up before it's ready to get more feedback from other people.  But we can use our time for other things for sure.

1:22:33 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I know, I think that's good. But do you feel that you need to like, have some time to clean that up a little bit?

1:22:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then for sure, this is not ready for this.

1:22:42 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Is better for you to use your time now, since you're traveling in Brazil, you know, we haven't felt like three, but like, would it help if you give you an hour to do this?  then it could be done before you travel, you know, and then it's on the on the queue for Romeo or the new X.  designer to start making?

1:23:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's best if we use the rest of this time we have to make it a bit more explicit.  Yes, I think that's better.

1:23:09 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, so should we go through it again or do you want to work on it without me?

1:23:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I would prefer, if it's okay with you, I would prefer to work out, work it out on my own and then show it.

1:23:25 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Okay, but then we can end anyway when we have half an hour left anyway so we can use it.  We can use it for other things or we can end it for sure. think I'd rather end it because I think it's important because now we have a lot of the control part that can be drawn and then if we have like this in like I think the best thing is you know by the end of the week if we could have this kind of outlined where a UX UI designer can start looking at it next week when you're traveling that's already gone pretty far because then we're still at least two ahead of launch right because we still have controls and we have third party so then we still have time when you're back in Brazil to look at risk management I guess right?-hmm, yeah, yeah.  Okay, perfect.

1:24:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:24:03 - A L (fortifai.co)
  Thanks a lot.

1:24:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Bye
