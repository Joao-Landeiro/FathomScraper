  Hello, how are you feeling today? Ah, I'm alright, better than yesterday.

0:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Good. Oh, I'm making some notes for what?

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. When are you next traveling back to Portugal? June.

0:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  June, okay, still a while then. Yeah, I'm to fly back.

0:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Along will you be there in June? I think a month and a half with maybe 10 days of holidays in the middle.  That's nice. Yeah, I think this will be the year I'm traveling most. Your wife is able to do that with work?

0:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  She can work remotely?

0:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, she has her own consulting company. I think we're... or forced to do this because of being in between countries.  And no kids also helps because no school will move in.

1:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me just send you the link for the Google Meet before we start. It's here on the chat.  Should we just move over there or what do you think?

1:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think so. All right, yeah, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. All right.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's move my screen in the mirror.
