0:00 - A L
  down like Domino's it was the same thing with COVID it was like every day we just like went down yeah really stressful you're still sick and you know that there's another one just about to get sick yeah I know so bad it's like a funny parenting story like so my my middle one he gets like really when he gets sick he he really feels that compared to the other one so he's like so he ended up like throwing up and he was like running to the bathroom throwing up and then so I I went like and checked on him but I didn't realize he drew up on the path to the bathroom so I ended up stepping in and slipping and falling in his puke and I was just like you know I'm like all right and he felt so bad he's like mom I'm sorry don't worry you puked on me many times but like I was just like it's like oh god this week's winter vacation right there you know yeah um I gotta gotta say I mean uh it must have been uh yeah

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we scheduled these bits yesterday because we didn't have enough time to go through what we wanted to go through for the third part in management, right?  Yeah. But at the end of our conversation there were a few things where we had more clarity. I think that the bit that we left at was this, right?  So there's a whole process, there's our part in the process. It begins with the risk assessments and then with the supplier questionnaire based on the supplier questionnaire.  There would be tasks, different tasks that are related to different controls. Is this accurate?

1:58 - A L
  Yeah. Yeah, that's how I see it. Yes. Okay.

2:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we already have a supplier questionnaire, this is... Yeah, and we have the risk assessment already, too.

2:15 - A L
  And then... So we have the first one, and then we have the second one. And then the code of conduct, control one and control two.  Take the training and abide by that. We have the text for it. We have it ready. And so it's like...  So it's the same mechanism that we have for the policy assessment and the training part. So we have that already created.  just needs to be put into the right order. So maybe what we don't have is the task management follow-up when you have a meeting with...  And maybe the process we're missing is like, okay, they answer the questionnaire, right? Then what? Then how you... to get like as a compliance officer I've just sent out 30 questionnaires.  They all come back. Do I look at them individually? Is there some kind of flag being like these, know, the amount of nodes answered meaning these are the ones I need to look at or do I need to look at every 30 individually, you know, at once and like check them off to decide on the next path or like I think that part might be missing.  What do you do when you're getting back?

3:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think this is the question you're trying to answer, Yeah, exactly.

3:44 - A L
  And then because they're evaluated then they'll probably either like the ones that have the biggest risk you need to have a meeting with them and then you have process we're not sure that we have developed maybe it's like the meeting nodes and then like what should you discuss so that you can you can track  that part of it or you deploy them a training and you right in the meeting notes we will deploy them a training to take.  Okay so like and the communication part right because they're remember like I guess we didn't build like they asked the questionnaire you might have some follow-up questions to the questionnaire right remember Anya was saying that like they didn't answer a question you're not really sure you want to be able to communicate with them in that part will be missing.

4:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so let's try to do some sort of very basic business modeling. So now we try to bring this here here.  We sense risk assessment, sorry, the risk assessment is done by them, right?

5:15 - A L
  Yeah, they do the risk assessment. CO does the risk assessment to narrow down the scope of the suppliers.

5:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, CO uploads.

5:46 - A L
  Okay.

5:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  CO, since supply questionnaire is

6:00 - A L
  One n or two n's I never know Two I think I don't know. It's okay. I understand Yeah, and then yeah confirms the questionnaire I guess number for the first time they need to confirm that the questioner is okay or edit the questioners If we allow for that, but then they send it like a CEO confirms or edits questionnaires.

6:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and then send the questionnaires to people Okay, then the CEO Like chases or collects like you we send it out and then you need to check that it's been done Mm-hmm Okay for now is this but in the future  maybe it's not the CEO, it's like suggestions by next steps. And CEO takes next steps. And this could be a definitive.  So basically, this is the linear process, nothing is linear. So they do the risk assessment to narrow the scope of suppliers.  And let's say that these are, sorry, these are user actions. These are actually, these are system e-mails and so on.  Let's change the colors of this. This is green, comms is yellow, third-party actions are different. So the CO does a risk assessment to narrow down the scope of suppliers, which means that risk assessment is a form also, right?

8:32 - A L
  The that we've done it now is quite manual, right? Step one, step two, do this, and then after you've narrowed it down offline, then you upload the Excel sheet.  That's kind of like the simplified version that we did.

8:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, Risk assessment, Excel. Yeah. Sheets. Okay. This doesn't have happened at the system level. This happens at the external tool level.

9:18 - A L
  OK.

9:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then they upload the list of suppliers, which is a upload feature at the system level. When they edit or confirm, it's approved, right?  It's used the same, which is approved. Yeah. Interface, Content, Edit, Approve, Interface, who already has this as well. And then we need to, basically, this is the deploy, right?  Deploy feature. And this would be the task tracking feature, right?

10:26 - A L
  OK.

10:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So here, we don't have a clear thing on this. OK. We'll go back to it in a second. Is the Zoom level good enough?  Can you read what's on my screen? Yeah, good.

10:43 - A L
  I can't read that bottom right, but that's fine. OK.

10:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now, our main questions are around this stage, this thing. OK, let's not make it red because it's dramatic.  OK. What? Center back, not the back. Center front view. One block. OK. Now we're good to go. OK, so right now, the way they value the answers is what?  Good feeling. How do people do it right now?

11:40 - A L
  It is kind of gut feeling, but it's also like a score from like yes or no, depending on the answers.  it could be like there's a risk tiering. do you have a policy to have you do training and if there's enough like nose on it, then it gets more, you know, like usually.  oh, yes, for everything you've got a self-assessment and they attach the evidence that it's good, if no, then it's not a good thing, and then you get more points.  And you need to follow up on the nose and ask questions around those.

12:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is like the basic version of that, right? A lot of people do it right now.

12:24 - A L
  Yes.

12:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And a future approach, future next approach. I like the word you've been using, the digitized as opposed to manual and also opposed to automatic, because I think it's a good range.  So I'm guessing that we could do the same thing, right? It's basically the same thing. Okay. Yeah. And the future advanced approach.  She is. Something like this.

13:31 - A L
  Yeah, like automatic would be they just yeah and automatic yeah next generator task or automatic question answer, you know, like big if they don't answer right if they write no big can you elaborate on no or like something like that.  Okay, okay. Straight up like AI like futuristic, like it all running by itself right. You missed this you didn't say no please answer like blah blah blah and then it was like an agent asking questions.

14:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  was a real action And something like this. OK, so now we have four states, and I think this is useful for us to think, OK, if we now stick with this one, we are not saying no to the other ones, we're just saying yes to this one right now, right?  So let's consider this approach for a second. There's a questionnaire. Let me see if I can open the. Sure, that's 45, share this step.

15:05 - A L
  And third party, yeah, what might the right third party on there?

15:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's compliance map, then third party, right?

15:14 - A L
  Yeah, I don't remember.

15:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's try. Yeah. Not this, maybe on the history, show full history, third party, no. Oh, yeah, was there. Yeah.  Okay, share this step. So now we have some vendors and reminder, it's not a reminder. Is the questionnaires in the minor can I oh it's send it and I see how do I see the The questioner right to the top right top right top right all the way the top.

16:13 - A L
  Hi.

16:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I had the fat and thing at the top Okay, so Is this a correct questionnaire?

16:21 - A L
  Yeah, it's like a five-second questionnaire But yes, like I we probably need to look at it in more detail But it's like I probably attached to the t1 that came through very quickly, but yeah It's a it's pretty close like eighty ninety percent.  Mm-hmm. And then ideally there should be like add evidence I don't see that as an option there, but like there should be one or add comments or add evidence, but They added I'm pulling it into the mirror.

16:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's hope The picture is too big to for mirror. Let's Sigma Okay This will take one minute because then we are working fully on and I also I think I think it's if my understanding is correct I mean it's okay probably our users are not most of them not too capable or too interested in validating the thoroughness of the questionnaire right?

17:27 - A L
  I bet you like the it depends again about the ICP right the ones that don't know anything we'll just take it at this the ones that do know something will probably want to look at it like I think even Anya gave us her questionnaire that she wanted that said I think they would if we worked with them on it or like if they wanted to change it wouldn't be that different I would say there but yeah but I think the ones that are like the ones that are the ones that are  are knowledgeable they might want to have the flexibility of changing the questionnaires eventually like themselves and like doing that but that you know affects kind of like the possibly the results in the scoring part of it but then I think we need to check with that but I think like this here is like yeah so they should be able to accept this it's not that off from like what everybody else does everyone just does like different like so I think like if we say like this is all you're getting and they may be willing to but I think we also need to validate it with them mm-hmm okay so back to the mirror this is okay so this is questionnaire right now yes no yes no yes no so there's a there's a form and then the digitized okay do we know what are the thresholds for the next steps  What do you mean the threshold to the next step?

19:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If I have like 10% of yeses, I'm really bad. I think that, well, I don't think we should set that.

19:13 - A L
  I think we should let them decide is would be ideal because some will have a higher risk tolerance and be like any kind of nose they have to trade the training others might say, I would like not I would say we give it to you and then we already pre-program these steps that you can you can you can collect like send them a training to do send them the policy to sign off like set up a meeting and then you decide a task or something like that okay so okay let's role play you are a complex officer you sent me a form I reply back to you but I do blood diamond mining so I get a really bad score and what what do you do with like I do reply  Yeah and maybe there's room for yeah okay what do you do if I said you like really bad question then I would go back and like clarify like I knew I would say like I'll send a message like are you sure you don't have any policies but most likely I would be like let's set up a call like we need to have a call and kind of go through your answers with you um like if it's really bad then you have to have a meeting if it's like it's not so bad okay go and do a training I like yeah like okay you entered two out of the 20 and didn't seem that bad okay just do a training or policy confirmation it's fine and then we'll do a lecture but if it's like horrible then you have to have a meeting and you need to document the meeting with them and it's really better call the inter poll right right wait there's a way um okay but this is like you know it's the it's not the most like freak people can lie a lot on this right they just go yes yes yes yes right like so it's like if anybody was like doing child labor in like a mining they're not gonna answer  Yeah, by the way, you know, little kid here. Yeah, let me take a picture and attach it. One question there.  You know, they're going to lie. So that's like, but you have a some kind of like, like, as part of this, like, you know, do you want to do it?  you know, even if you want to go even more, it'd be like, do you want to do an additional background check on the company?  Right? Like if it's like, if it was like a very high risk, high profile, high, a lot of money, I would do like, I would pay an investigative firm to do like a thing.  And that could be a task, know, like, God, the answers are so bad. But we really need to do business with them.  Okay, let's do like an investigative thing and have these investigators do a background. Let me attach the background check into the thing on when and I prove that, you know, and I so that's kind of that can be like, but that's like, next step.  But I think most basic ones will will pass along with the sign off. Okay, so

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it got it got it and all it is very difficult to to codify rules into this because it's always very contextual and depends on the file the risk appetite and all that that kind of stuff so what I'm thinking is um instead of uh instead of telling them what to do we give them options right yeah so this is this is what I'm thinking let me make a quick drawing let's say that at the end I don't like the score let's say that at the end um we get um so responses from third party and there's a few things and this yes no no  No, okay, so they sent this thing back to us, right? then as a compliance officer, we can see, and I really like, I think you've seen me say this kind of stuff before, like the bronze option, the silver option and the gold option.  So we could give them options on next steps, right? This is the compliance officer's view. Next steps, and we say, okay, you can meet.  Anyway, it doesn't matter the options, but the fact that we give them options is helpful because they are not overwhelmed.  I agree.

23:47 - A L
  Okay, helpful, but flexible, cool. Yeah, it could be like, you know, set up a meeting or send the training, send the policy or other or something like that, and then they could decide.

24:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so this is I think is really useful because it's a good stepping stone for the automation as we collect more data on what people are choosing we can later use that as a recommendation algorithm like people in your situation for this kind of thing they usually pick this one right and it helps us so okay we get this and so when whenever they click a thing like one of these things it should generate a task right okay so it's it's it's this it generates a task this adds next steps so evaluates answers this means egg answers feature which work already have it approve not  approve, plus comments, right? Which is our current mechanic for this sort of thing. And then the side next steps is next steps screen, which we don't have.  Okay, so maybe I think what we need to meet feels that what we need is this thing and the pairing of what are the possible next steps.  If we have a list of like six possible next steps, I think we are pretty much there. Okay, so you said that's possible next steps.  Let's change this. And now one of them is set up a meeting to discuss. What was another possible next time?  Do further background tracks on the company?

26:30 - A L
  And then send training, send them the training and send them the policy for confirmation. I'll pause on that. I guess the next step before that is also like ask questions, right?  Before you even set up a meeting you're going back and forth and asking for clarification emails before you need to decide whether or not you want a meeting.

27:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this probably around here, this way. So it could be kind of a screen, something like this, right?  Okay, and when we, let's say, let's roll play this. If we click on ask, clarify questions, to me, this seems a very freeform kind of thing, right?

27:50 - A L
  It's kind of like the email, know, when Anya was like, yeah, and then we have to follow up with some questions that they're not really sure, and then like you kind of lose track of the communication.  And like, you know, if there are way that everything could be in one so that you you follow like and I think we and I think I don't know yeah it's like some kind of communication thing in the supplier port or something like that but like um like you have all of your communication with the supplier that you can ask after they they send the survey in because like most like you probably have some questions what do you mean by this or oh your attachment that you you documented is not um um uh you know uh are the com you know like you'd be like hey you you attached the document but the document was incorrect you you said you you're gonna do your child labor policy but you did your it policy instead can you you know something like that i think we have something like this right now which is the comment observation yeah i be but i'm not sure if it goes to the person to come back like i think the comment one we have right now is like our own comment like oh i sent him an email on this you know versus an actual communication thing back and forth with the supplier portal at least about  hasn't been set up because there hasn't been a supplier portal in the past. Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

29:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I agree. there's the email, right? if what I'm thinking is can we reuse this primitive, right? And let's say it's a different scenario.  I'm an employee and I sent you the gifts and hospitality for and I put something wrong in the information.  And say I do not approve, but you put some comments in the observations like, hey man, you need to give me more details.  I get that in an email, right? Okay, so we are already interacting via the comment box, but the interface, right?

29:48 - A L
  Like I don't know how our setup, I feel like the way we set up the comment box right now, it's not an email.  It's just or this is a comment I'm keeping for my own administrative. It's not a communication function. not how because we hadn't discussed that before but it could be like it's like if you put a comment and it goes in and then their data is there that's fine but the way it was more like knows like I did research on the company and I found out they had a child with this case in here make this comment here and attach the evidence okay okay okay the the opposite impression but we need to figure that out so set up a meeting to discuss right now in the platform we don't have a mechanic for you know handling that kind of thing

31:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so the the bronze level of fixing that is just giving them Here is what I'm thinking Our selling point is unified place for it, right?  But if setting up a meeting Happens outside the platform. We are opening a thread That people will reply to view the email and we are taking people out of our own ecosystem, right?  Yeah Ideally even if we must do it in the beginning, but ideally we don't do that in the future But I don't think we also want like a dedicated video call thing, right?

31:50 - A L
  It's not I think it's more like if you you have like if you have to go to the Training portal and they have to like they go to their own supplier portal.  It could be like, you know training policy see questions you know answer questions so then like any kind of questions as of there and then they respond to the questions there and that somehow lead to whatever question it is in their like in their file like that could be enough for it but that's related to this bit right the clarifying question yeah yeah okay but that I think it's I understand that but I'm thinking about this one it's a video I think it's more I don't know is that like I don't think we need it in the in in the clarifying question it could be like here's your meeting link or like or just be like we have set up a meeting it could be out we don't need to be like come a zoom or anything like that or they could just document the meeting it could meet like either we get a section on meeting notes in the in the clarifying question area being like hey thanks okay okay a meeting or something like that so maybe we should remove these from next steps yeah I guess that could be in the clarifying questions if we want to do that or like or that meeting has to be outside of  the process, guess, outside of our form. And then we have the same policies and training thing.

33:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, cool. OK, this makes sense. So let's say I am a third party, right here. No, we're to do this right.  Whenever we step out of the frame, it messes up things. So let's say I am a third party.

33:50 - A L
  OK.

33:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. And I have things I must do, right? I'm in the middle of a process for, you know, becoming a new supply to you.  And where is this? Share this tab. Okay, I need to sign in again. And, right. Right. Okay, okay, okay.  Sign in. Okay, yeah. Okay. So, in boy portal, I understand that is not the same thing, but it's pretty similar at this time.  So it's probably in the submissions, right? Yeah.

34:51 - A L
  Yeah.

34:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And when I open some.

35:00 - A L
  Missions we can see, you know, we have a submission like just like like kind of like we have for the whistleblowing right like third parties we can have a box like send information send questions request information so it's not like a one-way street so that's where this could also be there.  I'm not sure I follow. But like right now the way that we're doing it is a one-way street it's like you need to do you need to do the policy you need to set up a meeting answer my questions.  There could be a case and this being like I'm a supplier of you it's like it's not just like Xiao telling me to do a training tell me to do a policy to be me like hey Xiao I want to give you an FYI and give you information so I could be like proactive and speed like or I could be a whistleblowing like Xiao there's like actually things going on here is like that so there could be like communication the other way not just like kind of like I'm using this as a task management on the supplier side.  No no got it got it.

36:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that avenue is still open, right? Yeah, OK. But what I'm thinking of is if we're in the middle of a process that we haven't finished yet, they need to be able to kind of know what's missing from what's stopping them from becoming like an approved supplier, right?  Yeah. So I'm assuming that they did get in. They see a task here. They can also check on my submissions.  And they'll see, oh, there's the supplier questionnaire, right? And there's something that's missing on it, OK? Something like that.  That's my mental model for this right now. So if I click on it, I'm take into the approve not approve results page so which is similar to what I would see as an employee if somebody doesn't approve my my thing right so we have some we have some answers yes we have some things no right and at the bottom or at the side actually we see those that somebody filled in we don't have we can read we're not right read right so we see this and there's notes  It's a little bit like, so right now people use probably word documents and Excel documents. If they are sophisticated, they probably use like comments, but a lot of them probably don't use comments.  No.

38:19 - A L
  I think Anja showed her, I don't know if she shared it with you, but she had a huge Excel file that is like it's attached and please manually write in Excel and then they get the feedback.  There's no analytics around that. If you're smart, like smart, can do like a, I've done MS forms, right? And then you set forms and then you get into Excel and then you do it.  But other people, like, yeah, like them, they even worse, like have an Excel attachment and then they fill it in manually and then they attach the Excel attachment and then they fill in the answer.

38:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's even harder to like kind of compile into.

38:57 - A L
  Like multiple ones, and then you have fairly separate. cell files, it's like really hard to do, and that's what I'm to do.

39:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I'm thinking is in the in the past we have discussed the idea that even the approved flow would have different versions and at different levels of granularity.  Yeah, so in the future maybe I could approve individual answers and those would be fine and would question like individual answers as well just but for now we don't have this, for now we have only the comment box, right?  So or something that would comment box. Yeah, so what I'm thinking is let's role play this. I've sent you the form you replied back to me with some questions and now I'm in  party portal and I see that you didn't approve. Okay, so I need to see the status. You need to see like, yeah, have they even done it, right?

40:11 - A L
  Because the first thing usually what they do is spend time just chasing the people to make sure that they've done it.  Because that's not that statistic in itself. Like you want to be able to say to the public like 100% of our supplier, you know, our risk supplier base has like done something, blah, blah, blah.  So you're chasing them. then I don't know if the status should say not, yeah, like, yeah, maybe it hasn't been approved.  Do you want to say approved or not approved? Why would you not want to say? Because you, in a combined sense, like, if let's  hits the fan, it's like, look, you approve them in the system, right?  Like, like approval is like, yes, they passed our controls. Like, yes, we have done what they need to do.  But we're not saying like, we approve that Xiao doesn't have child labor, you know, off of like, I think approved can be fine, but they kind of triggered me because I know a lot of compliance people don't need to take that ownership of it, right?  Xiao says, no, I don't have child labor in any minds and just based off of his honest response that he made up and whatever, we approve and think he's great to go ahead, right?  It's more like, yes, he's passed, like, yes, okay, I don't have any follow-up questions. He's done the controls and that, but like, I'm just thinking semantics.  I think if you do approved or not approved, it's fine. And it's also very rare that Xiao that you're going to not approve.  Like, it will take a lot, like, you know, like, if you are like, even if you're doing like, a billion-dollar business and you have child labor, it's unfortunately the reality of the situation is like companies care about money, right?  So it's like, it's, you're never going to not be approved. You'll approve with conditions, you know what I mean?  Like, we approve you with doing different things. So I don't know, maybe I'm probably just overthinking, but I just know that compliance people don't like that, but I think we could approve, not approve.  or approved with conditions or something like that. then that can be the ones that, yeah, let's just do that.  Not approved, approved with conditions, approved. And then you have a list that you can follow up because there might be a case that you're not approved because you've done really horrendous things.  Most likely you'll just be approved with conditions.

42:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so status, because OK, we were talking about the different thing, this brought up. Give me just a quick second, please.

42:30 - A L
  Yeah, all right.

42:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, sorry. So, the point is, the thing we were discussing was the view from the supplier as the farm has not been approved yet, okay?  And I need to know if they're still pending, I could say just pending approval, okay?

43:25 - A L
  Pending review, like yeah, pending review or pending approval, am I over my meeting? Oh , let me check the owner's order, say I'm not, okay, no, I have a customer meeting that's with, you're not able to join a feedback in 10 minutes, right?

43:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, because I've, yeah, the other thing, yeah, that's fine.

43:45 - A L
  I just wanted to make sure, I just thought, yeah, we have 10 minutes before I need to jump off.  Can you hold a second?

46:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, let's use this minutes row. The thing is, as a supplier that is in the process of getting my form approved or validated or accepted or anything.  If I got my form back with some comments, then it is not approved yet. I need to explain some things.  I need to know if there are things I must do or if I'm off the hook already, right? So, when I'm checking the answers, when I'm checking the answers on the supplier questionnaire, I should be able to know that, oh yeah, this is not done yet, right?  There are things I need to do. So, pending approval. And come on, Ben, so annoying. Okay, so I see that I sent you some things.  You sent me back saying, please give me more detail on this stuff, and I can see your information here.  Can I send you, this is question, as a supplier trying to sign up, can I send you texts? I should be able to send the text within the form to justify my answers.  I think so.

47:39 - A L
  Yeah, I think that was missing on our form, but I do think we can have some additional text to explain.  Yeah.

47:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this thing is not true. We also must be able to write comments. What we cannot do is...  No, we should be able to write anything. Yeah.

48:04 - A L
  Right. Okay.

48:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. And I send it to you as, so I am the, I'm stealing the, the supplier mode sent for approval.  Send, you're about to send. Okay. Yeah. Got it. And this can happen like many times. Like if I'm really incompetent, I might be struggling with the forms and we are on revision 12 of this thing.

48:43 - A L
  Right.

48:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the longer the form, the longer the higher likelihood of this happening. Okay. So the notes at some point they might get really long.  Yeah. Yeah. The notes might get really long, okay. Revision 1, revision 2, revision x, okay. But eventually I get it right and when I get it right, I see this thing and it says check, doesn't show the warning sign anymore and it's checked, cool.  And then there's more tasks because now the compliance officer will send me a policy, send me training and that stuff will show up here as a task, right?

49:57 - A L
  Mm-hmm.

50:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, we'll show up at training and show up at policies. Right?

50:04 - A L
  OK, yeah.

50:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so the things we need to design are, I think we need to design this thing a little bit better.  Design this better. And we need to design these next steps. Same. And for instance, stuff.

50:30 - A L
  Yeah.

50:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I don't want to open another can of worms.

50:35 - A L
  For the time we have right now.

50:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But basically, there's two ways of us doing this. We just create the task and says, hey, do further background checks.  But we don't track how they do it. just chose up the task. Yeah.

50:50 - A L
  But we could do that.

50:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think this is it. OK.

50:56 - A L
  Yeah. Great. Okay, I think at least it like you'd be great to like yeah, I have a Romeo look at end design And then we can like stress test it with some of our pilots also before we go into development But ideally it would where I guess with Thursday So I don't I I could try to set up a time with some of our pilots by Tuesday or something To have a discussion with them.  I don't know if that enough time for Romeo to draw it by Tuesday Thursday Today's Thursday Friday Monday Tuesday I Yeah, it's a bit tight if anything happens.

51:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We might need to reschedule which is bad I would I would aim for Wednesday just to be on site if anything we can if we get it done on Tuesday We just send them like a screenshot to you know tease them.  Yeah, they'll feel yeah this progress, but then on Wednesday Okay, Wednesday.

51:49 - A L
  I'm in like I'm off site Our day on Wednesday, then I only have like morning meetings. It'll be hard one day through Friday to sit  Do you have anything because I'm off-site from 12 to 4 on Wednesday through Friday? I'm mornings are free but with a time difference it'll be difficult.

52:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Test, test, test.

52:12 - A L
  Or maybe we don't need to stress test it before we go to development. It's enough and then we can stress it afterwards.  Or is there anything ready by Tuesday that we can kind of stress test partially on Tuesday even if it's not all the way done?

52:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, to be honest, I think that we'll be... So there's the fidelity of the test influences the responses we get because people pay attention to different things, right?  I think we are not at a level of uncertainty so big that we need to check this at this stage.  I think we're pretty confident. We are reusing so many things. We're pretty confident that we can just kind of develop it and then adjust little things.

52:48 - A L
  Okay. Yeah, then that's fine. If we can get it by Wednesday because then they could start developing on Wednesday.  We don't need to stress test it until after it's been developed. in different parts. So hopefully they can develop it quickly and we could stress test it and then change things as needed.

53:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

53:07 - A L
  But at least there's enough now to get started. think so. Yeah. Perfect.

53:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

53:12 - A L
  Then we, but should we have any meeting on Tuesday to like between you and me then like Tuesday afternoon to go over any other remaining design things?  I think I just one now also sent a message to meet. But is there Yeah. Like in terms of like risk assessment and like how to build the next part of it.  Like to like, if we want to get this product out, you know, by the end of March, there's still other parts we need to build.  So it could be to discuss risk assessment.

53:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's use the today's design sync to see where the gaps are. On that.

53:49 - A L
  Okay. Because yeah, but that's fine. Because we also, we also need to make the design sync. there a design, there's not my calendar today.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can do three o'clock for the design sync. Three o'clock?

54:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I cannot do three o'clock. have a meeting at that time. But okay, let's do it this way. Right now we have clarified that we must fix the, solve the dashboard.  We must do the third party management and we have like enough information out to develop that. And we also have something else which was, add more direction.

54:34 - A L
  jump off into this client on call.

54:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's talk a little bit later.

54:38 - A L
  can be your talk on Friday at the design sync. Okay, thanks.

54:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.
