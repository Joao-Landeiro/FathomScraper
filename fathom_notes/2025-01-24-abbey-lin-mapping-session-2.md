0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, for the third parties, I also have some requirements that I sent to the outsiders, right? And these outsiders, they, some of them will say yes.  There's a very stubborn one that never says anything, and that stuff, I get to see it. This guy said yes.  This guy, this guy said yes, and this guy never said anything. And based on that, they see the compliance officer  needs to make a decision, right? So the third party requirements is functionally the same thing as the policy approval kind of thing, right?  Yeah, totally, but it's for external stakeholders. Got it, got it. So the components of the system are the same, like I put something out, I send emails to people, okay, which is good because we can reduce a lot of the components, right?  Okay, so risk management is a little bit different difference, I understand, right? How is risk management, can you? Yeah, yeah, okay, and this is what I made.  Because there's different, there's like, there's so many different ways of doing risk management.

1:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I could do the ICANN away, or do like a traditional risk management way. But the main thing is like, and this is why you focus on ES and G.  ES and G risks are pretty similar, like, across the way and then so you have to like list out possible risks and then you need to send a survey out to people and have them rate the risk and then ideally you'll all come out the same and then you can and then you check it against financials and then you have your risk.

2:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does that make sense?

2:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's like you start with it you have a starting point you look at like actually if we look in our tool I can show you we have a written down in our tool how we do it it's just not ideal let me the way we're explaining I think I think it's working for me right now so even without the term okay yeah like so it is so I'm just gonna let me transfer to this device to back to my computer and I'm gonna I'm just gonna show you just for myself because it because that's it's how you should do it okay so  Let me, so you need to familiarize yourself with the risks and then you need to collect information both from internal stakeholders and external stakeholders, you know, like you need to do internal research.  Like, like, so I give you like a list of risks, right? But then, like, I don't know Zhao's business that well.  So you actually need to look at other standards like. SASB universal human rights index, different things, and you need to do it yourself.  You have to look at your company policies and see if there's anything that's interesting there. And then doing research on competitor companies and say, Hey, what are you doing there?  And then from that, you should have like a list. Then you send out a questionnaire to different stakeholders that are important, like the employees, the board, your suppliers, your customers, your investors, all of the people who have some kind of input into your business.  And then they go in and drink the risk based on what they think is material. What are the most important risks of your company?  And that's how you and then like now with double materiality with all the law coming in. It's like, you have to map that against your financial impact.  you do a mapping of that and then ideally you come out with like your three or five most important risks.  Those are the three to five, you ideally are going to do the policies, trainings, communications, controls and everything on.  But we're kind of hijacking the process because I'm like for a digital company I can tell you in 80-90% these are going to be your risk and these are going to be your controls and these are going to be your policies because you're not that special, you know, like and that's kind of how we're doing it.  Got it.

4:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so there's let's say, there's risk one, okay, and there's some internal factors to that risk and there's some external factors, right?  Usually a risk will either be internal or external.

4:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Ah, okay, okay.

4:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or like it could be very generic, like we have an anti-bright degree of corruption risk that could be the one risk but that risk can be broken down into five controls on how you manage the risk does that make sense just thinking so role playing this CEO when it's officer is like okay I need to do my risk thing looks like this right and this means that I need to have to send to ask things to multiple people I need to ask something to this guy I need to ask something to this woman I need to ask something to this person okay and some of them are internal some of them are external right so each one of these persons did they get kind of a form related to  that risk. And then they get back to us, and some respond, and some never do. So at the end, I have a risk, but this risk is comprised of different factors or different aspects, I don't know, and we have answers on two of them, but not on the third one.  So this risk is incomplete. Kind of everybody needs to answer that you want.

6:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And this is like not the whole employer base. Like for a risk management, it's like seven to ten people, like seven to ten key people.  It's like your whole management team, ideally some members of your board, key customers and suppliers, like you know, two or three each, like you're not talking about a large, so you should get all of them to respond to the questionnaire.  And then from that, you usually have a meeting where you kind of rank being Okay, it looks like this do we agree with it because you don't always have to take with the top three that come up, but You do that, but like so we're trying to keep it into like the But then again, this is like the Rolls Royce version versus like the the Toyota version And I feel like the Toyota version is like hey, you're a digital company Here are your risks like that we have controls already based off of do you agree and most likely go and have you done additional research Yes, okay, then all of our controls all of our policies that we create all match That in terms of the Toyota version Okay, so so the Toyota version is not this flow that I that I drew right?  Yeah, so that's like why like you can see like environmental risk management part It's different than the governance risk because I started drawing the governance risk one that we have in a tool That has like the surveys you send out and you do that because a lot of the governance people don't want to do iso The ones that in like the environmental one like if you if you look at the ISO one like the ones like

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  show the design, like the design team, they get, they ask for three information. They ask, who are your stakeholders?

8:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Give me, like, and they have a form, right? They have a form that says, like, one, who are your stakeholders?  Two, what are your environmental aspects? And then three, what are the legal regulations? So those are the three risk factors that they really care about that you need to fill in for the E side on the environment.  So, okay, I understand.

8:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, so my assumption is, S and E risks are kind of the, they're kind of tracked in the same way.  We are starting with this as well. We are not really putting too much effort on the G risks, because the G people are not interested in eyes or vice versa.

8:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, well, yeah, it's like, like, I think it's kind of like, how do I say it, you know, like when you met Anya yesterday, she's probably not the only reason she'll buy our tool.  is because of the third party parts, right? none of the people that we're talking to are gonna buy our tool for the risk management part.  You know, like risk management is kind of like a check the box you need to do it, especially for the ISO.  But for like the D-side, that's usually another department that's like a whole risk management partner that's going in across all risks and different things.  Having said that, within the new regulation that might be delayed in CSRD that everyone's scared of, they require a double materiality.  They require that you do a risk assessment and document it. So our tool has to have some kind of risk assessment as simplified, but I would say that like, I kind of like delaying risk management till the end because we could also do the rest of the process without it.  And so that's, I feel like, if we get third party right, we get audit, whatever that like we can reverse engineer it or like even like manually do risk and then just add in the risks that have been done and that would be okay.  Okay.

9:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, for now, we are not too interested about risk or reporting, we are more about controls, we should have something on audits, we should have something on third party, we should have policies done.  Does it look like this, like our version of the V1?

10:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Reporting, like V1 as in June or as in like what are we going to deploy or what do you mean?  Yeah, let's say June. June, I would say that I would put it out controls as much as policies and third parties because you can't have a system work without that and move audit in.  So, audit and reporting. like very small like it could be even like documents that we just collect information and generate and then risk can be like a slightly a slightly higher but I would say reporting an audit can be like release like almost document libraries in the short term um but you we need to have a developed control part and then like like at least like a half develop apart for risk because at the end that's one of the main things they have in the regulation.

11:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so it's is it like this?

11:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah probably more like that.

11:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just to help to understand like how far we should go on each thing. Cool so this is for the V1.  and fine the thing understood controls risk priority.

11:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And so we're not that far if you think about it can policies trading communications almost done controls we drew out for EU that we need to draw out the control half of controls G is already set up in our tool.  But we I feel like we're missing the segue into those controls. It just like kind of throws up controls in your face Right, you go into it.  You know, we don't have a step into that But those are pretty much done and then third party I think we need to like that's the thing with on with you know with Anya and like whatever like I have like something in third party But I don't think it's pretty right now and I would like to get that one a little bit better.

12:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Yeah but I mean if we were Because third party is kind of the same is the same mechanics of Yeah Getting kicked out of this room.

12:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I thought I had this room I think I have this room don't I Yeah Yes, I was checking the wrong thing.

13:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, yeah. Yeah, sorry.

13:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But...

13:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, third party, the mechanics of it are basically the same policy, right?

13:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's probably closer to controls. Why?

13:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because you know the controls, we have a conflict of interest survey that you send out annually.

13:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's closer to that, the conflict of interest survey that you send out. Like the actual control itself.

13:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But then the steps towards it in terms of like approving, like a control you also... Yeah. like in terms of sending something out and and doing that.  So there's different like third party has different things right you it depends on what you want them to do if you want it can be very much like policies procedures and communications because you might want to send out I want to send out a third-party management policy to you Zhao as my as my supplier and I want you to confirm that you've read it so you know what my roles are right like that's like policies procedures training communication that is the same but there's an aspect of the controls part of it whereas like I need you to actually send out a survey and show me that you you're signing off that you're like really ethical but what are you actually doing in your practices that you know what are your controls that's actually working right here here you need to answer my survey and show everything you're doing because that's my control and that's your evidence so then that's kind of like the control part of it me sending out a control thing to you for that mm-hmm okay from a system from a systems perspective even like the back-end thing of a form that you say  And you collect one, you collect five pieces of information and a policy that you send and you collect one piece of information.  They are basically the same thing. Yeah. Because they both exist within the platform. They both can be linked into the platform.  They both auto-save as you fill it in. mean, they look different. I understand that. But they are functionally kind of the same thing.  So if we have the policy by deploying a function that's more like controls, it is different. But it's like 80% of the same code.  Yeah.

15:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  know a lot of that can be repeated, Good.

15:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because the interaction is, I send you something, you interact with it and you send it back to me and I keep track of stuff.

15:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's the basic model.

15:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So third party also seems from a functionality point of view, probably close to done. Then there's screens

16:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  about it.

16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the reason I keep insisting on the similarities of these things is that so far most of our discussions, especially with the other participants, have been around the way it looks.  And if we discuss the way it looks without bearing to other things that do the same thing and looks slightly different, it's very common that we will start making small changes to one part of the user journey, like visual changes.  And then we need to cascade all these changes back to the things we have already done. What happened with redesigning the compliance map or stuff like this?  if we were running for a design award, I would say that's a good way of doing things. we are not, I think we are probably really good on just keeping it consistent and not redoing design because there's one thing we didn't consider.  It's a balance, especially around the launch.

17:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We need to understand what is our overall look for the first one, so then we can apply it to all of the other ones.  I would say, so that's the balance. At the same time, I truly believe one of our differentiators is going to be our look and feel.  Because there's so many other tools out there that can do what we're doing, that do it in another way, that sit into another enterprise thing.  What is our actual differentiation is the ease of use for employees. If we crack the ease of use, and the ease of use both for the person using it, and for the employee base that it lands on them really well, that is the threshold that is going to really differentiate us from in the market.  So that's why I feel like the more we can refine that, that when we're testing our pilot and the word of mouth and all of that, that is an important thing because there's so many tools that do surveys already.  There's so many tools that already send out this. I know. That's why I'm trying to be a little bit nitpicky on some of these especially as we launch.  But I agree with you. keep minor changing, but I don't think we have the full design ready yet to be even duplicated.  Got it.

18:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because the point is that curve flattens really fast. The curve of the effort on design and impact, at some point we are putting a lot of effort to not go up a lot.

18:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I fully agree with the ease of use.

18:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The ease of use is a network of things. There's look and feel, there's information architecture, there's the mental model of how people come into this, which is why it's very useful to speak with people like Anya.  Because they tell us the way they think about the problem. And the closer we get to the way they think, the easier it will feel to them.  So I fully agree with the ease of use, but the thing is to have capacity and bandwidth to improve this stuff, this sort of stuff, we cannot spend it all on this thing.

19:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, I agree and I, but I also think that like, it's also because we have Romeo working like 20 hours a week or 15 hours a week, right?  If we have somebody else that can also draw the designs and help with the look and the feel, we can also get a pipeline of like smaller changes to be able to make it work.  But I think I agree with the balance about like one point we need to get the tool out and do that.  But I feel like there are some lower hanging fruits that we can do to make it. But I agree, like I think like you need to get to even some of the controls and the sort of the actually what are we trying to build, right?  in there and we need to get to that.

20:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  at that point too.

20:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it. Yeah. So, okay.

20:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now I have more clarity on the third party controls. We, we have some controls. Just, just orienting myself here.  What would be the most useful thing for you to do for us to discuss? I think it's the controls.

20:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you know, we, finish up the E controls and then finish up that segue into the G controls. Like what we need for that, just so we know that that's on the light pipeline of like that's going to be drawn on.  Because it's like, we're focusing a lot on policies, procedures and trainings now, but like two weeks later, we need to launch controls.  And then two weeks later after that, we need to launch third parties. So the more that we know what needs to be drawn up and like what's missing, the more helpful because then we have a pipeline of what needs to be done around that.  Okay.

20:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of controls, we have designed having reporting for offices, the cloud, we have, we have not discussed, I'm still missing this thing but I can send you an asset.  But we have some forms that we need to do to convert. These forms are related to controls, correct? controls, okay.  So is from the environmental perspective controls, what is missing for you?

21:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So if you like if you think about any kind of like, like, I think it's like, you know, I'm just gonna go to the app because that you can see.  Okay, do you see my screen?

21:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I see your screen, yes. Okay, so like we have controls.

21:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we go straight into this controls, right?

21:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like it doesn't really make any sense.

21:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and then E, we don't have anything because we don't have, you know, we could go to the three that we drew out.

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  right?

22:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I think this needs to be updated to match and I think he's kind of done that, right? He's kind of updated controls to match the new design, which with a little bit of explanation, right?  But right now, if you go into conflict of interest, let's just say, right, or conflict of interest declaration, it goes straight from like, this is it to the form, and then the form for deployment.  Like, shouldn't there be a page in between being like, hey, this is the conflict of interest form? you want to declare, you know, what is the due date for the form?  Like, there's a missing segue between like, going straight into a page that opens up here, and then straight into like, what you need to deploy.  It's the same thing for like, ethics survey and expenses. Like, it just goes like, it goes from here, like, like click on expenses, and then it goes like, oh, this form isn't even the right one.  But it goes, it goes straight into the form that you need to do. So I feel like we're missing like an explanation on, you know, like government official, okay, well, these forms.  Those are not the right ones, but I think they're all wrong, like employee portal and then like same thing with the employee admin employee portal submissions.  I don't know if they're set up filling forms. Yeah, no, they're starting to put some of the new forms in, but it's like, yeah, I think we jumped into some of these things a little bit too much and it'd be good to have some kind of segue in between here.  And I think it helps with the new design, because there's a complex interest form, there's an explanation of what each one of these mean.  we can check that, maybe that's a thing, we can go into things and say like, what are controls now?  What is actually missing? But we're also making all of the controls because we just did it now, but then like the G, we have some controls, which I'm realizing that we don't because they're not in there, but we have them laid out already and we have the design for them.  So I don't know. We should also check with Yvonne why those aren't in there. do we need new designs for the controls and I need to check.

24:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but what you're telling me, I took a screenshot and what I hear is problem, we arrive at the sections with a little explanation, right?  We need to include explanations. Is this correct? Yeah, or some kind of flow I guess towards that, yes. Okay, so maybe we can have a basic template, I don't know, let's not say template because it's a loaded word, but there's a standard, there's a 45 standard, let's call it.  so before we enter, let's 45 standard. Okay, so before we enter this thing, which is the task. Okay, this is the meat and bones of what needs to happen.

24:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so like you enter it, I guess he's kind of created it, but it's not like, it's like, he's kind of, oh, it just happened.  Here, right? this kind of looks like, know, even this is better, right, than before. So if they put this in, so this is kind of a reiteration of the policies section, right?  It looks like this, but it looks like controls because, like, here, completely of interest. Here is some text underneath and start.  So even having this will be a little bit better because it will give you a little bit more insight, right?  And this is a similar format that policies has, right? It looks just like the policy one. The controls section.  But my thing is like, okay, you click on conflict. This is better because it tells you at least what you're clicking into.  You click on it. Like, shouldn't it be like a segue? And it could be the same segue in everyone.  It doesn't matter. Like, but it's a segue saying, I don't know. It's like, this is this. This is why you're doing it.  You know, this is how often or like, like some kind of thing before you jump into the form to approve.  I think we're missing that intermediate page for all of them. Environmental included, like between. Perfect.

26:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. I agree. agree. So that intermediate page, we need to design it once and then write the content for all of them, right?  So, perfect. So, let's, you want to design it now? I don't know. that's you, I think it's good.

26:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's missing and we need to get it done.

26:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, conceptually, what kind of information do you want to put there, like, the task, I suppose? Maybe some background on why it's important.

26:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Background.

26:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Why task is important. Okay.

26:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You know, like, who needs to be involved, maybe? And I'm wondering in some of these, can they do some setup in it?  know, do you want this to be annually? you want this to set out, you know, reminders?

26:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, could it be some... You know like like set up section there likes you know, who do you who do you want to deploy to or I'm not I'm not sure, but I'm Yeah Let's let's separate the explanation from the setting up Maybe that makes all the sense, but just to so we don't get lost in this segue section.  Do you see my screen? Yeah So in this this is a task. This is the thing I need to do But before I get it, I get it that the desk is like a pop-up explain what's about to happen or something, right?  And you know on that segue the content of that segue. There's the desk. There's why the test is important.  Who needs to be involved?

27:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Name of course I'm mostly like, you know that survey or that control should be the last part of it So it's like before then it's like all you're doing that's just a survey or like you're just agreeing to that questionnaire But before the questioner you need to decide who you know, you confirm that you want to send it to the whole organization You confirm like this is the

28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  due date or maybe it's a rolling one so it doesn't have a due date you know like something like that and then so then it's like are you ready to deploy it and then yes and then it's done when it goes into that one to deploy i'm gonna i'm gonna try a full but i'll try it so where i don't know okay so let me take the screenshots uh easier sigma okay okay uh okay compliance map you work on the risk assessments you  Give me a second, please. You want me to take a screenshot of it, or? No, just to... I'm going grab something.  I'll Okay, okay. Okay, I'll say so. Okay, I'll click on... Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, and then I click on.  So we are going into controls, correct? Environmental controls. Okay, and then I, there's no controls here. Okay, perfect, okay.  That's green. You're muted. don't know if you're saying anything.

31:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sorry, I putting in a new design for the controls here. Like you said here, that's the one that's been designed.

31:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's going to replace these two, I think, on top. OK. So these are screenshots from the actual website, right?  Yeah. There's inside of controls, there's controls, and inside of controls, there's controls. I think it's a little bit confusing, but.  Yeah, I don't like then.

31:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  don't I feel like maybe the left menu needs to somehow change or something like that, but I agree.

31:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't know. So but coming up on this thing. Welcome to the control section, and what you're saying is that this thing above will be completely replaced by the thing below, correct?  Okay. And the things, so do you think that the thing below already answers some of that?

32:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think the new version already answers a little bit because it tells you what it is, like, you know, because like there's a line underneath like conflict of interest and you have a line to say what it is, and then there's a welcome to the control section which will explain what it is.  So you're not suddenly going into this table, you know? So I do think this one will help, at least, and then they'll click on one, and then they need to go through it.  Yeah. So I think that this new design will really help a lot and it'll be more optimized as it but I think this kind of matches everything that we're doing already for policy decision training.  So I think it's good that we keep it with that design. Okay.

32:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me just take another screenshot. Okay, okay, upload my device, this thing, yes. Okay, so what you're saying is that in between this and this, there's something missing, right?

33:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  In between this and the actual control itself, there's something missing. But I don't know if you see my screen.

33:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  when I click on one of those things, and it takes me to something like this. Yeah, Okay, and the thing that I should see is an explanation, correct?

33:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, a little bit more information, I think, because I think about somebody who doesn't know the subject, right? Especially if we're going like, yeah, Anya would know what a conflict of interest register is, and it's fine.  But like, if it suddenly goes to you and you're going like, click on this and then suddenly. going to survey and then suddenly you're deploying it, you're like, what am I even clicking?  know, it's like, there needs to be a little bit more context and then maybe an explanation of the flow that's coming, like first you're going to review the survey and then you're going to deploy it to the organization and then they're going to get an inbox in their employee portal.  Are you okay with this? You know, some kind of confirmations that they know and then they go down.

34:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I'm thinking about which pieces of information should be included on this explanation. flow.

34:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, maybe even the flow because if you think about the questionnaire, that's like probably number step three in the flow, right?  So you could like do one, two, three, and then they're kind of following it so they can see what the flow is.  You know, I don't know, I'm just thinking about four, one, two or something, you know, like, first here's the explanation, two, here's the toggle between the two or something.  Okay.

34:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's okay. Thinking about something that we can do to create a format and then reuse that format as a rule like every time somebody clicks one of these things it takes us to a page that looks like this right yeah that's important so we have a little bit context we have an explanation of the flow okay and maybe this is the v1 of that okay the future maybe we can add more stuff or I could envision a moment where there's some video everything yeah we're just creating a channel on where to put this information right yeah maybe if we do this we should have some sort of an option like I don't want to see this I don't want to see this again yeah some toggle because you know pros they just want to move quickly right yeah  Okay, and if we have this toggle, we also need to have a way of untoggling it because sometimes you are a newbie to say I don't want to see this again, but then you do need to do this three weeks later and you don't remember So we need to have some sort of a link I'm putting it here.  I need to put some sort of a link to show Explanation Again And by doing this We can have So let's talk about progress.  So we had a compliance map. There's some changes to it Okay, it's organizing the way that people already think about it, which is great I choose the section controls.  It was like this looks beautiful, but it's not very informative So now we have this this new version right this new version This version is better.  What we like about this version is it does an explanation for of what's happening There's grouping there's status, right?  There's all of these different things. And there's explanations on the bottom to explanations of each control.

37:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  explanations.

37:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

37:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's explanations of what the control is, but there's no explanation of what the process is like with the control.

37:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The is, but no, the process. Okay. And this, we are fixing with this inclusion. And then we have some sort of an explanation of how it  look like. And when they say something like, okay, I get it. Yeah, they're taking to this to this thing, right?  Yeah.

38:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

38:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And even this form that we're looking at right now is not I think the best version of a form.  I think we have designed some other forms at some point.

38:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think maybe we need to update the forms.

38:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That could be like a good point.

38:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think I think Romeo has updated.

38:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you can maybe mention or find out.

38:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So there's a couple of things.

38:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If we list them out, I think it's important because we get used to this. But so we have compliance map, okay?  Compliance map is good because it matches their mental model of how to do this. Yeah, I need to get a battery.  Okay. We have a list view. Details. Okay, we now have an interstitial screen that helps with context and flow of context.  of task. And we also have friendly forms. So if we look at all of these things, these are the small decisions that are manifested in the design that make this easier to use.  Some of them are fully developed.

40:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Some of them are we are still finishing that.

40:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So solving this problem, I understand the urgency of it, solving this problem is relatively easy.

40:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it's quite easy.

40:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You just need to create a screen.

40:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  we will need to do this.

40:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll need to create a screen, but we will also need, and I think your thought would be very important here, to have an idea on what content will fit on it.  each of the controls, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I that. If we do that, we can put placeholder tags and so on.  if we build all of these screens at the same time, we protect ourselves from the risk of, oh, we've created one example, but this example is not good enough for this very specific situation.  So I think a good rule of thumb is just look at this. Sorry, look at this here. And answer these questions.  The way I would do this would be on just a text document, really. Yeah, I think it's like a glorified text document.

41:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If these make it pretty, then I think that's fine. It doesn't need to be.

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  perfect for the first time but yeah yes yes I mean when I said text document is it's like the way we as a team that is developing Fortify will coordinate this is just create the text document and share it yeah yeah yeah okay so if we develop this thing in the design and develop this thing which has every aspect of being very easy we already solve many aspects for the controls for the environmental right yeah and and and for the and for the governance ones yeah exactly yeah yeah I was gonna add in yeah because I think put in oops did it go in very small no wait why is it so small try to draw it

43:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's because we're using massive zoom is not the problem. Okay.

43:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

43:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So this is kind of like the new forms as you know, the new version of like these forms, I guess.

43:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

43:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think they might still need to be not all of them are created. So that's like another task or like we could see.  But like at least you have that you have that I feel like they at least did the older version because we did it.  You know, there is a version that's already operated that we're using for telenoid has a lot of the governance ones already in there.  So we can either just copy it, but it's not the best design. yeah, to track which forms in which design.

43:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think one of the difficulties of this project is we sometimes get a little bit lost on all the things that are on open loops.  Yeah. So making this spreadsheet will be helpful.

43:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, just for us like an internal one. Okay.

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. okay, so for controls, it feels to me that we have a bit more quality now.

44:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think so. But there's still a lot, you know, if you were to like break this down into actual design work, there's still a lot of like design that would need to be done, you know?

44:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, but because the design is now modularized on Figma, making like versions of this for different forms is much easier, much faster.  But if we can make a list of like, oh look, these are all the forms that need to be done, just use these components, that's like doing the dishes and just seeing the progress, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  See it in front of it, which is great.

44:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm sitting ahead from the sink. Yeah, yeah. OK, so we have some work to do to make sure that all the forms are up to that design and controls.

45:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and even like even that initial controls page, I think it's missing a few things right like that that the one that's improved like it's missing like there's no and I think it's on there that's where you see your picture on there because we made those comments there that need to be updated.  But like there's no index, right? What is? What does it mean to be pink with the green one? You know, like you have it on policy page, but you don't have it on this one, right?  So that probably needs to be added here. So people know why, why the different things, but I think that's a comment already that's there.  It just in the figma, know, but there are a few things that need to be updated also on this one, you know.  Mm hmm. Yeah, and then like the question is like we want to add new controls in this section right like right now I said no, just because I feel like it's a lot easier to designate the controls they need to follow.  But eventually I'm sure like one of the other ones are going to be like, I want to add this control and like, you know, like, do we add that option or not is, you know, a question but I think this is enough to at least launch it I think.  Yeah, I think people will ask for that for sure. But I think, yeah, for this version, this is good.

46:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also adding the buttons is not complex.

46:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because I think like, yeah, it's like I create new policies. If you think about like some of the flows, I create new policy, new training, create new communication, create new control, create new audit tasks.

46:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't know, can you create blah blah blah.

46:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There might be some thoughts for that, but I think right now.

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  While we have enough of what we need to launch and there's another thing that maybe we can discuss for a couple of minutes here regarding that so let me see if I.  So I'm going to be right back.

47:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well, I'll take two minutes then too.

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you you Okay, got it. So we have software. which is a 45 and we have users And we have Tasks that this not test but maybe maybe External users.  Yes No, no, but this is more for former from our perspective our perspective Okay, so this is this will be like Covenite Yeah, okay, and We help these users and get to the other ESG goes Via the software right we'll help them do this But the the the software we're creating is very Contextual because it's really related to the way they work, right?  Yeah, and I know we that's On the last So, one of the things that I could imagine that would happen eventually in the future, and I don't think we need to dedicate a lot of hours to this, but just start thinking about it, is how Fortify helps them make the software work for them, right?  Because this is my model of the situation, and forgive me if I don't get it right or something. So, this is you, and you are an expert, right?  Yeah. And you have maybe clients or people that could benefit from your expertise.

51:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And you have this software that acts as the layer, right?

51:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The software is kind of a representation of how an expert would think about this, right?

51:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

51:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But. I'm sure that there's a lot of, and we can see that when I ask about edge cases and so on, there's a lot of situations where the software really struggles to capture the nuance of this kind of work.  it seems to me that, of course, this is about scale, so software will give you a lot more scale.  But there's something, and I know you're following me on LinkedIn, I'm not about to sell your workshops or anything like this, it's not kind of like that.  So it seems to me that your business, as the business of Abby, there's a software part, but there's also the consulting part, right?  Yeah. And this might happen throughout, maybe the slices change over time, but yeah, I think they're like, I don't know if we can ever, it could be a dream that we ever get to total product-led growth that there doesn't have to be any.

53:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But even in some of the like series C or series D companies that we're kind of copying the model off of from the security and privacy side They're doing a very similar thing.  They have like even like minimal touch points, too Like they have like they have a guy from India like having meetings like, you know, 15 minutes with you every two weeks You know to help make sure that you're on truck So I don't know if you could ever get away with like kind of like some kind of manpower onto it But the goal is they have Most of it being done like with the software Perfect, perfect.  No, so yeah, I This is why I apologize because it's probably already on your radar because we talked about the software Which is the part of the business that you've hired us to talk about But surely there's there's stuff that some point will pop up on this side But yeah, yeah, I'm like to have a methodology around that like, you know I think like I'd love to get your help on and that because I think you're good in like it Just like it's not even a process right one is the software But where are the injection points of people, you know Throughout the process to make sure that it happens right and that that is going to be there but right now  like we can manage with our own you know pilots without only 10 of them for us to like you know run around you know but at one point is it like an injection point of like you need to have an internal auditor and we'll be your internal auditor once a year and come in and check everything's good is it a quarterly check that we need to go in and make sure you're actually filling it in because you don't fill it in like then there's no point and I guess I want you to greenwash so there are points where we need to come in but I think it's more like right now we're just trying to get the software side of it out as much as possible because there are some some people like the ones that you've been meeting but the subject matter experts are the ones that you've been meeting they'll always be on top of it but if you go to like Lars of Ock or Byron Marine where this is like not his main job he's not going to be on top of it right so he's going to need someone pushing him to do it yeah yeah absolutely no that's great I maybe you're familiar with this I wasn't I have only heard about it recently EOS are you familiar with EOS?

54:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know what is that I think it stands for entrepreneurial operating system oh yeah yeah I'm reading the book right now it's called Traction Traction okay yeah I'm I'm literally reading  Right now it's on my head.

55:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it's really interesting. I like it. Yeah, because then you know more about it than I do.

55:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm just intrigued by it because it seems to me like the game they play, the metagame of the other methodology and how they transform the methodology into a product is probably something that anyway.

55:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, I know exactly. I do think there is like I am taking a consulting like kind of a consulting prod like consulting way mindset but like using technology enabled consulting and then like how much you want to play in that in terms of the VC game, how much can it be like actually scaled without somebody or how much can it turn into a very like managed service, right?  Let's say we don't do the VC track and we become a managed service with technology.

55:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a possibility too.

55:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But yeah. Not perfect, perfect.

55:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if you I know I mentioned this, I know you are a modern founder of company reading is there's no time for that.

55:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But this like the product. Yeah, no, that looks really good.

55:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm all about like I've been reading so many books.

55:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I haven't like I haven't done all the things on the EOS system, but I just I'm taking a picture of it on my phone.

56:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I think that's.

56:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So, yeah, no, I yeah, I'll go look at that. But no, I think that I think it's good and I think.  This is what we need to do, like kind of put it around it and then kind of see how the whole thing is, because I could eventually see that this is like, I like I think we need the software anyway, because it would enable the consulting a lot more efficient.  But then the question is, like you said, how much because I do feel like there's some clients that are like, I don't even want to enter the software.  just want you to do the software for us. And it's like and then you get the automatic reporting and everything for that.  And that could definitely be an opportunity or even like consultancies or we're talking with consultancies who want to manage our software as their own so that they can do it that way.  So there's a lot of opportunity there that we can discuss. But yeah, but in terms of kind of design and like getting things up so that Romeo because I do.  I that, like, and I'll talk with Mal about this is I think that we might want to get a UX UI, another UI designer from our side, like from locally that can work with Romeo or something like that to help kind of fill in the blanks of the, all the stuff that needs to be done and have somebody close by, but I, yeah, so, but I would like to also work with you because I think you have, like, your strategy mind is like brilliant and I want to tap into that if you have availability for that.  So then we could, I'll talk with Mal about that and see, but that's kind of what we're, yeah, just give you some idea of into what we're thinking on that.  Good, good. No, thank you. I think we were looking at similar things.

57:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There was something else I was thinking about as a reference. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. This is just an inspiration, but I don't use this software.  I don't know about software, I've heard interesting things about it, not because of the software. because it looks ugly and everything, but they're business model, so I have some friends that have like marketing agencies, this kind of thing, right?

58:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, they talk about the software that's called go high level. Are you familiar with his name? No, I don't know.

58:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so yeah, yeah, white label and resell.

58:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, that's actually quite interesting, the white labeling, like if we, yeah, that is actually a possibility. I've never thought about that.  I haven't thought about in detail, but in the direction that we're heading, especially if we're working with the consultancy companies, it's not like the go to market with them.  Yeah, it could be that we end up labeling this and then like taking it on to their own, like putting it like change to the website.  Yeah, I'm not against this. I think it's more like we need to get our product out. Get the first part out and then like and decide, yeah, no, I think that's good.  I do think like there's still like a lot more that needs to be done and we have some more meetings next week around that.  around around s because s has not been really discussed and like now I found out like two like three of our customers want s also so that's like a whole other thing of like what can s look like so yeah so if you have time next week I know we have us do we have a session we have a session on Wednesday but do you have time on Friday like for my other sessions or Thursday I have time on did you ask Wednesday or Friday Wednesday we already have something on Wednesday we have in our schedule but I was just thinking if there's more because I really I think it's you're so helpful like I want to tap into you you're so helpful in organizing my brain and I so I think the more of that is helpful because then that helps develop product and then that also helps in terms of what do we need in UX UI design and all of that so it's just more like if you have any availability next week other than the Wednesday that we have set up like on Thursday or Friday is what I was saying because my  And it's already kind of getting tight Thursday works for me.

1:00:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

1:00:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

1:00:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like your time from like 12 to 2 12 to 2 Or 11 to 1. Yeah, maybe 12 to 2 is better though.  That's right safer 12 to 2 your time or my time? My time So 12 to 2 that means 11 to 1 to me uh, yeah Okay, great.

1:00:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. I'll say I'll I'll send you a You send it to me. Okay Okay I'll just put it from that thing Let me let me know if it shows up on your when you're Actually coming I guess, um, I haven't gotten it yet, but um, okay Uh, yeah, I got it now then then then that's good because then next week we can go through as to see what  needs to be developed for us and then for mapping it could be good to maybe even talk about talk about third-party management which will be the next thing coming and that we will have met with Anya on right I think we're meeting briefly but there's Anya next week or the week after I can't remember but um yeah there's enough to I that I feel like we're missing some of the pieces so that's like which really helpful meeting with you because we could see okay what are what are the flows that we're missing that we need designs on and then same with third-party because I think third-party might need to be redesigned kind of like I did this with like Rui back in the day but then we haven't really revisited it and we went so fast with Rui so it's like no and I think you're like better at kind of mapping out the processes and and you're your genius way of doing that so okay yeah that is no you haven't like and you haven't really like I haven't met somebody like you before that has a very like you have a really like powerful way of synthesizing information that I haven't seen before it's very impressive  Oh, um, yeah, yeah, so yeah, so I want to tap into that. Thank you. Thank you. But, um, yeah, but, um, okay, then I think we have an up until the next follow-up meeting, um, there.

1:02:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'll just take out some of these things from them into JIRA comments so we can keep track of decisions and reach some stuff with the Romeo to make sure we are on track.  Okay, perfect. All right, great.

1:02:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Have a good weekend then. Oh, no, I'll talk to you. have a design, so I'll talk to you later.

1:02:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, thank you and talk to later.

1:02:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Bye.
