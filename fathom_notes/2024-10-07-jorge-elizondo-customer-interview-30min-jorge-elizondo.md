0:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you for having this call with me.

0:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I couldn't miss the enthusiasm on LinkedIn and just moved so fast and sent me an email. You had to search for that email, so it's me, thanks you.

0:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you and yes, I found you to sub-stack and I really enjoyed how you live your frameworks and everything.  looks really clean and it makes me perceive you as someone that could help me what I'm trying to do.  know, it's building this new consultancy, it's not like for organizations, but mainly for people or other coaches that really want to integrate what I know.  That my expertise that is psychedelic coaching and innovation consulting, you know, but What I need, you know, I already do retreats if I go already like into the into the zone I do retreat psychedelic retreats sometimes I Work with different kind of profiles from engineers to doctors to housewives to Better and everything in between and they are all want to heal but right now I'm moving To another part of my evolution and I don't want just to heal people, you know, I want to help them create your own identity in a way, so I'm mixing like The methodologies that they use in software development with branding and you know those kind of Framers that they can illustrate how to Embody a new identity for brands the same thing I want to do that with people or with businesses bought with the excitator  I like experience in flu, infuse, like if it was kind of a secret sauce of my methodology. know, so I'm trying to see how can I productize also, you know, my work, because I see that when I do events, it takes a lot of toll on me, you know, like having to sell the tickets and things like that.  And right now, my newest addition to my work, it's teaching or helping others to become a coach, you know, become a psychedelic coach.  And I have 26 students, like a study in my method. And right now, I have to get in the meetings two hours per week, like for the mentoring and things like that and the presentation of the program.  But maybe I was looking at, I can productize perhaps the model, the work, you know, like the program. And I want to know like, what can it be productized?  How can I develop more of my frameworks, you know, because I also have a Part time I have lots of things, I have infinite resources, but I haven't been able to design my own technology, and perhaps help others design their own technology, because lots of my consumers or clients or coaches or professionals that they want to change their path, they want to integrate psychedelic coaching into their lives to impact more their clients, because we have this trending psychedelic consciousness, so I see there's a big opportunity for me, because I'm also like an expert, I'm a 35 in university in the US and things like that, so they trust me, but I need to know how can I create a business model that can sustain what I want to do, and also scale it in a way, because I want to scale it and be less about me, because right now my personal brand is Horvili Sond, and I want to do more about like a commercial brand that can scale my work, so I  I was thinking about a consulting firm or something like that. I hope you understood. Yeah.

4:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There are so many things and so many keywords you use, not just now, but also your website. The email sent me in the podcast.  So many words and expressions that and even references like in various novel people like that, that I get the sense that in that regard, like productizing one's expertise, I feel that we share a lot of common ground.  So this is great. makes it easy for me. I think it's relevant to bring this to the beginning of the conversation.  I am more focused on like the workshops as product. So for instance. I'm not guy that has experience with creating courses, for instance, and I could imagine that courses are a little bit of part of the ecosystem of things you have or are designing.  Not a courses guy. I mean, I know I could do it, but I think it's just much better if I'm very clear about that because I have more experience with the workshops.  That's where my circle of excellence is, know. And given does it still make sense for you to continue this conversation?  I don't want to take your...

5:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, that's perfect because I didn't mention that, but I also, you know, one of my things that I want to do is, you know, maybe do, because I want to do like more digital things, like let's do like a one-day workshop of five hours or two-day workshop where we can do, we can use Miro, or we can  It's my method, know, because a lot of, you know, when we're talking about psychedelics, it's not about taking a psychedelic, it's about a process, you know, like they need to do an intention, they need to, they have lots of things, you know, it's in a way, do that like this kind of creative, collaborative workshop, where I can have you with my insights and to help you decide which ones are the best ideas to go after, you know, so in a way, we can do the matrix thing and, you know, I had a friend that took a program with AG workshops, something like that, AG and smart, AG smart, so he's teaching me kind of that and like, you know, how can we integrate that in my kind of methodology to make it more innovative, because in the psychedelic space, it's more ceremony with the shaman and there's no technological kind of things, so I want to integrate it, know, so I can put more efforts in building like a digital brand experience, you know, and when I do presentations to help them guide them through mirror.  or mirror they have these you know images and like well designed you know experience you know so I want to push the digital kind of experience.  I think having these interactive approaches with mirror mirror and I know you're an expert on that we can develop something that could feed kind of like it can become one of our main problems in a way you know.

7:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now absolutely so I love that this still makes sense to you I mean I was very intrigued by what you're doing so I want to keep talking to you about this.  One of the things you've mentioned that just right now in this conversation that I thought it was really interesting and it's a key point is and I think this is very common with multidisciplinary or very curious people is that you have this huge amount of references and tools in your  toolbox and you know implicitly when to use each tool like oh this situation I think I should use this thing or this situation I should use that thing and one of the common challenges with this kind of profile is selecting which parts do we want to talk about at each stage right because if you just arrive and drop everything on people that's too much if you just say I can help you with this and then we'll see how it goes it also sometimes people don't feel so sure like yeah I guess but you know it lacks a certain assertiveness so to say so I think in a from a general perspective I think there's two different ways we can do stuff together so one of them is more around codifying your way of working so this looks a little bit more like coming up  with your own framework, or are connecting your different frameworks in a sequence, or like, oh, this is like a path, like a map.  If I'm here, this option makes sense, this option makes sense, this doesn't make sense right now. But if I'm here, this still makes sense, and this one starts to make sense again.  So I see those two paths codifying a framework I gotta say that the difficult thing about codifying a framework is that we do not stand still.  So the moment we start designing your own framework or or shaping it, you'll keep reading things, you keep going and having experiences, and you'll have this an instinct of wanting to keep changing your framework.  And it's very easy to have it not just as a working progress, but because that's normal, but doesn't. and finish thing like I'm always developing my framework and now there's like this little specific thing that I want to add and you never get to something that is in front of people.  So that's the codifying framework perspective. The other perspective which is a little bit more tangible is we look at the services you provide and we figure out where would the workshop make the most sense and we kind of figure out the framework as we build the workshop.  The second approach I like the fact that is more tangible quicker, the challenge of the second approach is you might as you evolve and you build up your ecosystem of offers and products and services.  It could happen that these initial workshops that were workshop formats. that were like your first start at this. With time, they might feel little bit obsolete because you've built more stuff, and now you have like a broader view of things, and you see, oh, okay.  So this workshop is not that it is bad, but now that I have more stuff, I would like fit this workshop in the rest of the stuff, and you might need to adjust it.  So there's these two different approaches to this. The first one is more foundational, and a little bit more abstract.  The second one is more tangible and more oriented towards the Mirrobor, script, facilitation guide, knowing what to say, what to do, the activities, sort of thing.  How do you react to this?

11:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, it makes sense at the end. like the clarifying part because in a way, there's two side of my business.  There's one that I have already ongoing. Also, sold out events throughout my two, three years careers, all sold out events on all my retreats.  So I have like a validated business for what I don't want to continue that part. want to change the road more digital and more about doing the consulting that not about the healing but maybe about more innovation in a way.  So I think I need more clarity in the process of the user journey to really understand like better like which services are going to be the best I think.  I'm at the beginning to decide like how I want to make this and where in the process the workshop fits the best as well, you know.  But I think it's better the first one because it's more foundational. We can create the foundation of the methodology in framework and I know it's like kind of a piece of art.  It's not about mixing it again. It's just about living in that like that. But I have a process to really create another methodology.  like we do, I could have like my nuclear framework, which where I can decide new frameworks or change frameworks, but not to change every time the same framework, but I have like a mother framework that will develop everything else, you know, and not just my own framework, but frameworks for other people, for help, or also help them to design their own frameworks in a way, helping me to have that nuclear framework.  And in a way, also, I see that, you know, I've been looking at my life and what I'm doing, so I see myself, you know, I had this analogy that all the people want a GPS, the GPS gives you three things, a map, so you can see the opportunities and also like the like the dangers, in a way, it gives you a route, you know, you go to the route without asking any questions and the third one is safety, and if we want to activate people to move forward, they need to be safe.  So in a way, having like a wild design process, that it's simple and people know that, okay, I have all of these things that we can do together, but this is the process and let's put ourselves first and talk about all of our potential here.  And I think people need more of that because they have the information in Google and they can access Trisha DPT, but why are they coming to me?  Because they want simple, they want to be concrete, they want my leadership. So that's why we do, I'm looking to simplify this and just decide all the things and I'm always going to find a new thing and a new discipline, but we need to get to the fundamentals to the first principles and just work with that.

14:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, this is perfect. I completely agree with you. mean, information is everywhere and oftentimes also when you use the word my leadership, I people come to your for your leadership that brings really strong because  I mean, you can read all the books you want, but then you make an investment to work with someone and even the fact that you've made an investment changes the dynamics, right?  you're moving to uncertainty and you feel a little bit more comfortable with incomplete, but useful things, useful is the key word here.  So yeah, I think we have a similar approach on things. I have a few questions that I usually get in these first conversations, I have a lot of them, but I just selected the biggest ones, because some of them I could figure out from your contents, which is great.  So your business as it is today, what is the easiest part for you?

15:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's a nice question. I think, I Just having an idea of what I want to do, know, the designing part, the vision part, you know, like creating, you know.  It also contains, because I'm doing everything, you know, about the selling, the creating content, the, doing the copyrighting, the pages, everything, but the ones that it's my sweet spot, my son of genius, it's the vision of, okay, this is what I want, this is what people would like, that's how I entered the retreats, know, I have a vision of what I want to do, and I just, I love also studying and getting myself educated to really have foundations with my vision, to really believe it more.  So, yeah, I think it's, it's a vision, believe it in the vision, going for the vision and trying to put it in there.

16:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool.

16:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's so funny.

16:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When we, when we start to get a little bit more clear on what we we do, we keep coming across and finding people that we share so much with.  And the conversations start to get a little very, like I see what you're saying. I feel it myself because that's kind of how I work as well.  So it's one of the perks of being very clear on what you do. And what is difficult for you about your business?

17:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think one of the roadblocks that is being hard for me to really overcome with being building a team.  know, I have everything out first. That's why I'm counting you as a coach because I haven't been able to to really decide on.  You know, right now I'm building a system with someone else that is doing major table things that is returning, but everything I'm paying for someone else to help me.  But I haven't. being able to really be so clear. I have the vision but so clear in what it needs to be done and who do I need and how to select people because I know building a team is going to make myself grow faster you know so everything I've done by myself so I'm limited about my time so I think one it's being able to build a team and the most difficult thing it's been being able to create something else while I'm still doing the operating side you know like one of them got me a stock it's you know I want to do something new but at the end I need to keep doing the administration and the operative kind of things because this is what it pays me the other thing it's more hypothesis of what could I sell to the world you know so in a way I'm trapped in between okay I know I need to stop because I want to build this but I need to deliver this first because this is what it's paying so like kind of a stugging  the operations.

19:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That phrase talking operations is really meaningful, right? I have a third question that might be a little bit related to the things that just asked you, but I wanted to be super clear on that.  So when we think about like urgent things, something that is really, you know, hurting right now and it's not a nice to have, it's something you need to fix.  What is that thing for your business?

19:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have a solid thing around here, but what I'm like, it's urgent, but I'm also, it has to be related with the team.  I need a seller, you know, I'm doing this with a seller, I know I already have a good product, know, the seller, it's the one that is going to contact like call mail or just call address.  It's to people that are just following me and because, you know, there's an interest in just like having like a follow-up or, you know, people to contact my time for release because, you know, I also have these databases for, is it me doing the technical thing one by one?  Or is it me, designer is it me creating the content so I have lots of things so right now I'm delegating the content creation.  I just do some things but I have a team that it's like an agency that it's doing my copyright and everything and they upload everything in the community management.  So I've already free myself on that but right now I'm between, you know, delivering my process and be the seller.  And right now also I'm having some help from some psychologists that are getting like, are doing the one-on-one sessions with the people so I'm also like  I'm just working to get free of, I want to be an entrepreneur, a slave of my expertise, but I to do that.  the original thing, think, yeah, increasing the sales, because that's the fuel of my growth. you know, also like learn about when it's the best time, you know, because I know this is like winning like a gardener, you know, sometimes you sit with the seeds, and sometimes you like reap their fruits and things like that.  So also, I don't know what are my seasons. So there's some knowledge that I know I'm going to get better at it, but right now it's, you know, everything it's being done by intuition and everything is being working.  And sometimes, you know, I have this little like the volatility of the stock market, sometimes it goes down. But at the end, if I see the lawyer, I'm just going off, off, you know what, you know.  So emotionally, I can handle everything. I think I'm I'm really good at, you know, having this adversity, what I know, like in my mind, if I have a seller here, I know this is for someone that it's their own responsibilities to sell, know, and I know they have to sell because I have the product, you know.

22:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you've mentioned, no, that's very clear. And you've mentioned that your retreats, they are sold out, they usually sell on those.  And the image I'm painting in my mind is that you have a functioning business that requires a lot of your energy, but it works.  And you're trying to grow this business. Do you have like your own internal goals or places, numbers you want to reach, and that's what's driving you?  is there a dog after you that you need to handle? Can you repeat that, the question is?

22:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, absolutely.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You have a business that works, that makes money, sells out, and you are competent at it, and people come to you, so that that's okay.  And now you have that business, and you're trying to evolve that business, metamorphosis, right? You change your business. The thing, and here's my question, the thing that makes you need that metamorphosis is more related to an internal goal, like, I want to grow, or it's more related to, for some reason, this makes X amount of money, and I need to make it 2X amounts of money.  Okay, that's an interesting question, you know.

23:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In a way, we all want to grow, you know, and right now I have more ambitious because at the beginning, when I started, I just hope to make some couple of money.  Right now, I perceive more money, if I could do this, maybe I could do more. But it's not an external thing.  It's more about if I can develop something that is more scalable and more powerful and can impact more people, I can reach more people.  And if it doesn't have to be a part of me, I'm the only one that can do this, or I know that I know how to do it.  lot of people want to do it like that. I'm done with that mentality. I'm more like, how can I do more impact with helping others through, you know, how can I say it, you know, because it's not just an evolution of what I'm doing, but I'm tired of working with people like one or one.  So it's also about my self. How do you say like self care, self care, like self care? And also about I want a business model that aligns to the lifestyle that I want.  to aspire to, you know, because yes, I want to impact people but not sacrificing myself and doing the retreats, it's putting all my energy in that, you know, and if I have something more de-etah, maybe as the worship it's a good thing because I just put my energy in one bed and I have everything configured to self, it's not just a retreat that it's not just doing the work in the retreat but also containing the people from the beginning to how many weeks or months after, you know, that it's draining myself.  I want to stop that because that's the shadow that people don't see when you have others. So I know my value, you know, I know I can serve people but I also know my limitations, so now that I know my limitations, this is what I don't want to do anymore.  So my main urgency to transform my business model it's because of me not because I want to enjoy more time with my family I want to travel and I want to get the best of the digital and internet experience you know like I can reach other people maybe right now it's so loud events and it's high ticket and I sell it to Latinos what happens if I sell my things to Americans or to Europeans that are also open mind if I could get people that you know the Latino community they have an average like income up maybe I don't know let's say 1000 in the US 100,000 you know and they're paying you know if they are having an 1000 they're paying 500 I could charge you know maybe 50k here and I don't I don't care about working with more people as well I maybe it's just three four people a month what I have I just like the payment it's way better you know so there's some things that I am I'm trying to  you know filter and get my things straight but yes I just want to to change everything that feeds me better here.  Now it makes makes a lot of sense.

27:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you've mentioned I appreciate how I'm not surprised because of what you shared in the podcast but I appreciate the fact that you're very open about this not everybody is as you know and so the picture I have right now is like your business your personal connection to your business like what you see that you could do with this gift you have and these expertise you have and there's many things around it there's like increase the reach work a little bit less charge more because the money just is different for different currencies I mean Brazil Brazil and the reality is not a strong currency and

28:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  totally get that and you also seem to have a lot of you do have a lot of references around this like the names you've mentioned the authors you say I mean you said something before that makes me think that you've been reading the e-meath so you have these references and there's other people in the market talking about this sort of thing that I do and I like to understand better like what what in my approach made you think okay because maybe you are talking to other people of course but like what made you think like I want to talk to Jean how do you I think it's how you present yourself like I also ask my question why do people want to come up to me that because everybody's giving out medicine psychedelic medicine and we have different identity and it's because of the identity you know you project something that you know what you're talking about and you don't need to reference I know that you do but you  know how to also work with the visual thinking, you know, and you got to my mind, you know, like, I know this is what I'm looking for because I could see it, you know, it's not that I could tell you this thing and people can tell me I can't help you with this and that but you don't tell me I can help you with this and that, you show me, you know, that's why framework in framework thinking, visual thinking works like the best and right now it's also an ability they want to develop and that's why also I'm asking, you know, because I know that it's not just worship but also like framework design in a way that you do, so that's why they what I'm looking for like in a way I manifest you, you know, like, I'm honored.

29:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much. It feels great to, to feel so, so seen because that is the way I try to present myself and you've told me about challenges, have you, have you made, I think it did because on your website you have this guide.  Have you made other attempts to decide the guide of productizing your services other things you've tried to do already?

30:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, right now, I think the latest thing that I've done was the free psychedelic guy who's like a delivery treat guys for people can choose the right retreat and what I happen being able to To do something new right now.  I just want to do this and I have this new idea or concept that I Want to my new brand in a way that I already have the name that it's called the identity factory I want to create, know this not just Protectize the service but also have a thematic service, know, like the same the team will be like an airplane like Her like, you know, like take off like everything, you know, like using that kind of narrative in the brand Experience and also having that  the packaging, you know, I want to package my things better, you know, because when I do the retreats, yes, I have my logo, I have some gifts, merch, tote bag, and things like that, and I have my presentations with brand guidelines and everything, but not like an immersive experience of the brand in the internet about logo, and it's not about the typography, it's about all the elements.  also right now, I'm working with a new designer that is going to help me conceptualize kind of this illustration that it's going to be the personas of my brand, know, we have these movies, and we have Victoria, Woody, have Star Wars, we have their beta, but what about my brand?  we have characters? So, that's why I'm trying to develop a more integral conceptual brand, you know, so that's also where I'm in to do the new brand.  And as well, because I know. All of what I'm doing, it's been organic content, not paid content, anything. I've been so loved.  happens if I already pay for marketing, and the thing is, I haven't been able because of the psychedelics. That's why I'm changing because I'm going to put the psychedelics behind in a way it's going to be my secret sauce.  People already know me, but I don't want to like advertise myself, like I say, let's do psychedelics. No, first come to me and we talk, and then we see like where the psychedelic experience fits.  know, like, as you say, like, let's see, like, where the workshop fits right now, let's see where those the psychedelic experience fits first.  Let's do like an audit, let's see where you add. How can I have? Maybe you need a retreat. Maybe you don't.  Maybe you need an immersive experience, like a personalized individual experience, maybe not. Maybe you first, let's do this. We hope because I already have a process, let's do  to what we can do. If we found a roadblock, OK, let's try the psychotonic experience. How does that work?  And also, I want to also increase the lifetime value and the retention rate of my usage.

33:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bodges, I think you're going to like this. There's a framework. keep coming back to it. I really like it comes from video game design.  And it's called a mechanic dynamics aesthetics. So let me give an example. Super Mario. Everybody knows Super Mario. So the mechanic of Super Mario is that you need to traverse the level and reach to the end and that's the flag.  That's what you've got to do with Super Mario, right? And then you have different dynamics on that game. For instance, if there's a hole, you cannot fall on the hole.  You need to jump over the hole. If there's an enemy, If he touches you on the side, you die.  But if you jump on him, you kill him, right? And then you have several dynamics that allow you to fulfill the mechanic, right?  But at this point, there's nothing that says that Super Mario looks the game, looks the way it does. Then you have the aesthetic layer.  The aesthetic layer is like Super Mario is a plumber. And the goal that Super Mario is chasing is saving a princess.  It could be something else, but it's a princess. And the enemies of Super Mario, they all come from this like Turtle King, Dragon Guy.  So, and you could change the last layer. could change the aesthetic layer and put like Sonic. Sonic is the same game, but it just changes the aesthetic layer, basically.  And you, by separating your process in these three layers, mechanic, dynamics, aesthetic, there's a few things you can do.  The first one is that you get a lot of coherence. Like, oh, it makes sense. It's like this framework or this name or this expression, this archetype I'm using in this product connects to this one because the foundation was solid, right?  That's the first thing you get. The second thing you get is that it makes it easier to adapt things.  So you could have a workshop and you look at the structure of the workshop and it looks a little bit square.  Like, there's a timeline of things you need to do and outcomes from each activity, right? Not very creative. But let's say you take that workshop and you use it for soldiers recovering from PTSD, right?  And you change the static layer. It's the same workshop. But you change the examples you use, you change the words you use, you change the world you create around the workshop, right?  that's the easy thing. cool thing is to create a structure of a workshop that is coherent. So you have all the advantages in creating something that you can change just what matters the most for that audience, for that market, right?  So mechanics, mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics, I think you might like that thing.

36:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It sounds like, you know, this also framework from a UX experience about functional things, that you think and the more artistic or designing things, know, of the functional things.  But that's why I love what you say, because this is what I'm trying to, you know, I want to decide on the narrative defining also my target audience to really be the brand that they want to be part of, you know.  So this is not just about the framework, you know, like it's about like the complete experience, you know. the framework, it's just like if I want to go to Hawaii, maybe the frameworks, the airplane, thing, know, five, six,  seven, that it's good to know which airplane it is, but what I carry is about landing in Hawaii, you know, what happens if we bring Hawaii to them, you know, so that's what we want to do with the brand, what we do, what it's about the engineering of science, you know, before that.

37:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm more, so I come from the world of design, and within the world of design, I come from the sort of design engineering, which I think is the most square side of design, and I really like it, because if you have a good systemic view of things, you can find ways of putting the emotion and having the emotion do the right work, but if you start with emotion, maybe things don't work at the end, so that's that's my perspective.  start with the system and then we layer the emotion on it, and then we make sure that we are designing the experience, right?  I want people to kill this way and do this thing right now, and then I want them to feel this way and do this thing and moves through it.  This sounds like a perfect match. don't know if I'm going to have the mistake, but cool. And from the both things you've mentioned, you are more interested in the framework design thing, right?

38:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, well, I want to know in which ways after you've been listening to where I'm at, or maybe I could show you in other sessions what I have, you know, like you could see and maybe there's something that could be improved, maybe there's something that could be transformed, and or maybe we innovate, you know, like from what we have.  yes, I want Actually, how can you help me and with my vision, like, what's the best thing that we can do right now and which one is the priority, you know, because I also want to move fast if it's possible.
  ACTION ITEM: Prepare custom proposal for Jorge's framework/workshop design needs. This should address how to build a framework and/or design a workshop based on what Jorge has already built, rather than starting from scratch. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rabRBASuQGZkwadR9HFeysdEJsSUd2R2?timestamp=2341.9999

39:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I figured that from all the things you have going on, I figured that speed is a valuable thing for you.  So, my perspective is that we always start with the things you already have. I love the analogy of the kitchen, so you put all the ingredients on the table and you say, okay, I have these things.  What can I do with these things? And then you figure out, okay, there's something else I want to make and I don't have these ingredients.  And then we go and find a way of collecting that ingredient, that piece of information from somebody, that piece of input from somebody, something that allows us to create an experience for that person.

39:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, I like this analogy.

39:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  just, we start by looking at what do you do in terms of just listing is really a spreadsheet just listing clients you've had and what you've done for them what they got out of it what they enjoy the most it's it's square it's a spreadsheet but then we get a feeling of okay this is our circle of excellence because I think for people like you and I if we have this in common is that clearly you are very self-sufficient in terms of learning new things you can just go and learn new things and integrate them with your own knowledge that you have already right so this is not difficult for you and if you have this sort of profile common thing a common struggle is a desire to create something new that will give will be an excuse to learn a new skill that we've never used or used very few times you know for for instance for me I wanted to do stuff electronics and I was like yeah I don't think I know enough about electronics to make a business out of it  I'm just interested in them. And then I realized I shouldn't make a business about electronics. I shouldn't make a business about the stuff I know already.  Just workshops and product management. So we start there. We start like, what do you have at your disposal, right?  Then we create a sequence of all the different services you have, not the steps inside of the service, but like the different services.  And I think this is similar to a value leather that I guess that you've heard about. Like you have an entry product and then you have something a little bit more expensive.  The retreats you have, I'm guessing that that's already like the high level stuff, which is a little bit like the Tesla strategy, right?  Start with a roadster that moves non-market, because the margins are better up there. So we make this audit of your services, like I said.  And then we sequence the services, this is like what makes the most sense for somebody that begins. that becomes a client of yours.  Like, oh, they start here. There are people that do this. The next best service is this thing, right? Because what we want is that each workshop generates an output that is the input for the next service.  For instance, let's say you have a workshop that is a little bit like an assessment. This is a simple example.  Use that assessment for the next thing you do with that person. At the very least, you arrive at that second conversation with a lot more context and the examples you use, the person really feels heard and seen.  So step two is figure out within your services how they connect. The third step, we look inside of what people, where people have an aha moment with you.  And I mean, your line of business, I think they have like really strong aha moments, but we look at where they have like really strong  wrong experiences and shifts in perception like, oh, I didn't think it was this play, but now that I've worked with Jorge, I see that there's something new here.  And what we want is to put a lot of fuel in that moment, the transformative moment, right? And we shape the workshop around that.  The workshop is a, is it like a play or like a theater, is we create the conditions to replicate that ha ha moment with all its intensity.  In a practical sense, what this means is we understand the questions we want people to answer. And we figure out what are the best workshop activities that answer those questions, right?  So we start with the question and then we think about the activity, right? When we have that packet together, we  session you've made, we've recorded, I give you like some pointers, or I think it did really well here. In this part, I think maybe next time you can do this little adjustment, stuff like that.  Because my objective is if I build the workshop alone without you, it's a foreign thing to you. You need to cross that path with me and then like, okay, I know why the workshop is like this, right?  So we need to build it together. But still there's a transition where you take ownership of that workshop and say, okay, this is my workshop.  I know every corner of this workshop. I know how to handle anything that could happen in this workshop. I gave you the example of the workshop because it's a more tangible one.  If we were to do the framework thing, it's a little bit less tangible, but it's basically around this. We'll talk a lot in a structured way.  about how you do your thing and my biggest responsibility is to make explicit what is obvious to you because you're an expert and for you like oh yeah I do this and then I do that and I'm like why do you do this oh yeah I do that step because usually I've noticed that people get distracted so I need to do this step okay so that's part of your method right this unconscious competence you're so good you don't even realize what you're doing is a challenge for experts because they they struggle with explaining what they do because it's it's like driving you don't even notice that you're driving you just notice that you arrived right and you made a thousand decisions just driving and then we think people know but we know in a way you know like when we are trying to like you know sometimes for us it's so easy to drive and yes yes yes sometimes

47:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's hard for us to know like, how does it be like not to drive, know, like not to drive?  Exactly, exactly.

47:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like the the curse of knowledge, right? And that's a very, very common thing for for experts and people are experts.  Everybody's experts at something. So it's an expert at something. So it's an experience we all have like, how can people not get what I'm saying?  It's like somebody told me a good analogy last week that I thought it was really good. If you're talking about your expertise to somebody that does not have your expertise, it's a little bit like trying to tell them about the song by humming the song.  But if the person doesn't know the song, they don't understand what you're humming, right? So if you want to talk about your expertise to somebody that doesn't have it, you need to take a couple of steps back to a point that even feels a little bit obvious.  is to you. And there's ways of doing this. There's ways of really drilling down on your method. Like, what is your method?  Oh, I don't have a method. No, you have a method. Maybe you don't realize that you have a method.  And we just figure out the path you take in your mind. And we figure out every decision point, right?  Because at the end of the process, when But if you take a step back, it was not a line.  was a tree. The person only sees the line because they don't know that you were like, Oh, should I move in this direction or this direction?  They only see one line. But in your mind, it was a tree, right? And you have a way, you've mentioned map.  I love map related analogies. So you have a way of traversing that terrain as an expert. It's like somebody that knows how to read the signs and the moths and the stars.  If you're just following that person, it feels like, yeah, they just know the way, but no, they're getting all these signals, right?  So the framework mapping aspect is more related to this, to getting you to tell me in a lot of detail how you think about what you do, and then we bring up, bring it to the surface, things that are obvious to you, but for other people might not be obvious.  Am I doing so far? Is this?

49:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, good. it's, you know, it's about, I like the humming analogy, because in a way, that's why, right now I'm asking myself, why do I have a lot of obsession about creating my frameworks?  Because frameworks is like about giving the cues to people, yeah, to really understand the world. It's not just, I don't want, I just don't want to create a framework just to create it, because no, I want to create a framework that like, halves then.  get the answer without me telling the answer because it's not about me telling the answer or telling the song okay this is the song I'll be surprised no it's about you know like it's easy if you follow these rules or these principles you know in the framework it's not just about the tactics but it's about the mindset in a way you know so they worship it's more the interactive kind of playground but it's about the lessons that we're going to put on yes yes yes the work so it's a little bit like the oristics right you make decisions really quickly yes because you've made these decisions before and you know how they unfold and one thing I one of the things you've mentioned that I think is really important here is that sometimes people want to create a framework and then do the work and I don't think that works because the framework is a shared thing is a

51:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It doesn't work as a communication vehicle, if it only makes sense in your mind, right? A successful framework is a framework that fulfills its role as a vehicle to make ideas go further, right?  And that's really important because there's an ergonomic aspect of framework. You can have super simple frameworks, like three steps frameworks, and these super simple frameworks are usually relatively easy to remember, but they hide away a lot of the abstraction.  And what sometimes happens with these frameworks is that they become almost dumb. Like, yeah, I know that I should start with the end in mind, but why do I that, frameworks that are so complex, they're so detailed that there's no way nobody will ever remember that.  If they see it, if they see the papers, like, oh, this It's hard, it's a framework, but they won't remember that later.  They'll keep remembering it wrong. A very example is the business model campus. It's very famous, the business model campus.  I think of everybody that has seen the business model campus, maybe 10% of people know how to do it well.  Because it is a relatively complex thing, and there's ways of feeling it, which are not very intuitive. It begins from the right side to the left side, which is not obvious if you just look at it, right?  So the second layer of the framework thinking is we have this map of you think. And now we have to turn this map into something that people can hold in their minds, right?  You cannot have too much detail. The start of analogies we use must be acceptable for that market, for that audience.  It needs to be helpful, but not in a way that is too prescriptive, because if it is too prescriptive and people try to use it and it's simplified, it will break, it will not work for every situation.  So there's a sweet spot of how realistic high fidelity is, how practical it is, and how mimetic it is, right?  There's like these three things that you need to adjust them. And it's perfectly possible that the framework you use is way bigger than the framework you talk about, like you talk about a slice of your framework, because in your mind as an expert, you see a lot of nuance that if you talk about it, people will just get lost, right?  That's all. I would look into the framework thing.

54:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so, you know, right now I have another minute time minutes, but I want to know, like, what are the options that I have?  Like, how can we start working together? Like, if you would love to work with me, I'm open to work with you.  And I really would love to have because I really connect with everything that you said, so I'm not sure you could have it.  So you let me know, what are the next steps? Like, how does this work? I would love to know more about it.

54:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I have, I think for this specific situation that you've told me, it makes sense for me to write a few things down that are a little bit different from the usual thing.
  ACTION ITEM: Send email with new calendar invite for follow-up meeting next week, same time. This should be done to confirm and schedule the next meeting with João. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/rabRBASuQGZkwadR9HFeysdEJsSUd2R2?timestamp=3286.9999  And then you can make a decision on that. Can we, can we schedule another conversation from maybe a week from now at this time?  And then I'll present this next year? That sounds perfect to me.

54:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We can do that now if you have, like, your calendar. but I'm open to do it Monday and next week, next Monday or Tuesday.

55:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it can be same time next week. It works for me if it works for you. It's yeah, let's do same time next week.

55:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, I'll send you an email with a new vibe.

55:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And well, I want you to have time to have a glass of water before your next meeting. So thank you so much for all your share than your enthusiasm.  This just feels really exciting. So I think you can tell in my face. So I'll put something together to explain how I'm thinking about your challenge and how I can help.  Thank you.

55:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you for putting all the energy, the time. I'm really, I'm looking and asking for help because I know that I have something good and of value to the world.  just need to have to create, co-create, know, maybe you are going to be a great person to help me build this.  And thank you for that. That's really good. I'm really excited. Thank you, Jorge.

56:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have a nice rest of the day. Good meeting and you'll hear from me. Perfect. Bye-bye
