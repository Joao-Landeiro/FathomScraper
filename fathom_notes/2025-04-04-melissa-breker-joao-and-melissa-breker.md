0:02 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  This meeting is being recorded. What do you do with all your recordings? Do you use them?

0:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know that folder we used to keep on the desktop called PDFs that we never got to? Yeah.  Yeah, so I have a similar one called recording. Actually, this is... I don't usually go back to them, but sometimes I do.  It's going to be sure.

0:34 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  It's like, oh, if there's a really good idea, I can just go back to it. Yeah.

0:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what happens sometimes is that I all start making paper notes, and if the speed or the density gets too much that I can't keep up, I'll just lean back and let them...  But to be honest, yeah. There was a time where I would set aside some time to transcribe them. just have to like take the paper notes into like my obsidian.

1:03 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which is great for retention. But I mean, as soon as your workload work increases a little bit, or you just can't keep up with that.  yeah.

1:17 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. I understand. People say to me all the time, but why didn't we write, you know, because I do it like a stream of consciousness kind of blah, blah, blah.  Do you want me to remove it? can remove it. No, no, no, no. I was just curious as to how you used it, because on one, on one hand, I'm like, oh yeah, that would be really good.  And then the second hand is like, do you want more digital clutter? Because you're already professional at it. So does that help?  I don't know.

1:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I can, for the other day, I was working with a client and we've been having these meetings that we've  supposed to be spaced one week apart, but being spaced like three weeks apart, they need to reschedule and so on.  And it was very context-heavy, and I was like, oh, I need to re-watch this stuff. But the good thing about having a transcript is that you can jump to the, you're fast reading a transcript and, you know, scrolling the bar.  So that was good. And also, I've used this in the past, but it's been a while since the last time, which is taking my transcripts, uploading them to notebook.lm.

2:33 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And then getting them to look for themes or like pieces.

2:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. How do I work? What kind of things do I usually talk about? what's the patterns in the way I speak?  Stuff like that.

2:44 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

2:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah.

2:45 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. I think it's good. Yeah.

2:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, it's interesting. I mean, the good thing is that it doesn't take any space on my, on my side.  Yeah. So it's like insurance. Yeah, exactly.

3:01 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Exactly. Yeah, and I think that's the part that I would position with my clients is something nothing who knows.

3:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is the thing.

3:10 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  sometimes we, you know, we, we're inspired and we miss the piece because of something else that happens, right? So, yeah, I like the idea of that.  Yeah. Anyway, I was just curious.

3:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem.

3:27 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Me being curious, so weird, right?

3:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There was a time also that I think when we first, I was at that time where I would just keep an obsidian window next to the video window and I would try to type.  But later I've realized that made the conversations a little bit weird because I was, you know, coming across as just, yeah.

3:50 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

3:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I stopped doing that.

3:54 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I, that was one of the things that I was thinking about asking you about was. the meeting. Yeah, because we're both weird.  So we've already figured that out. That's next. It's so good to see, honestly, everything. You know, when you see people that you're like, I feel every time with you.

4:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I feel the same.

4:19 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  think we I think we were friends before in some other context. I'm very, I'm very picky, actually.

4:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

4:30 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I don't know why, but this I always like, Ah, this really makes sense. We always have some kind of interesting conversation to we always end up somewhere.

4:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's true. And at some point, like my my capacity for holding like these interesting ideas that I want to do on starts to eventually see my eyes shifting to outside the frame.  Yeah, that's how you tell it was a good conversation.

4:57 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. Speaking of good conversation. you shouldn't guess who I met with yesterday.

5:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Kurt.

5:04 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Exactly. And you were right. He is amazing. Plus also, you were 100% correct in introducing us because he's like, he starts talking about something he's like, and it relates to this paper, but it actually relates to this other paper.  And I was like, what? And he's like, wait a minute, this is interesting.

5:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  He goes hard on that.

5:27 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  He I was like, and the same kind of same kind of thing. I was like, why don't we just set up again, every three weeks, a hello, just to see how we're doing and come with intention.  And we share resources. Like, is there anything interesting in this mix?

5:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've met. So I don't know if he told you this, but I was following Kurt for a while, like for years on Twitter.  And at first, I was a little bit, yeah, maybe jealous, even like, God, he's doing the thing I want to do, but he's actually doing it.

6:02 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I'm just thinking about doing it, you know, that kind of thing.

6:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And eventually I got out of my own way and, you know, met him. And it was like, as you met him, super nice, super open, excited about it.

6:15 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  and super just lovely.

6:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Generous, very generous. And I was like, yeah, I should have met this guy way sooner. anyway.

6:23 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  You met him at the right time. I'm in this zone lately where there's all of these weird things that are happening because I'm just allowing it.

6:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it funny?

6:33 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  instead of like, and strategic thinking for both of us is like the super skill because we see things where people can't see them.  But I think I've lent on it really heavily, this is going to happen. And then this and then this and that takes the magic out of it.  Like I came across this quote this week that I was like, I have to write it on my board.  It says. Science is magic that works.

7:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know who said it?

7:08 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, so that's Kurt Vonnegut, the writer. And I was like,  yeah. Because you know, like, I stepped away from the experimentation piece after the school of possibility because I got busy with work.  But all of these things lately have started to be like, hi, you know, this thing that you actually really want to do.  And talking to Kurt about it. I was like, really, I'm just an idea engineer. I just pulled two different things together.  Look at where the, you know, what's the confluence and what's the impact of that. So kind of like an idea DJ where you make something and you make something else.  You create something else. And he's like, okay. Yeah, like he had this, you know, this, you know his face, right?

8:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And he's like, Yeah.

8:09 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  So like looking at that in a different way. So part of the thing I thought we could talk about, or at least I'm curious about from your view, the ideas are not the problem.  The inputs are, again, we have all the inputs. The management of the inputs probably could do better with that.  So I'd love to hear what you've been doing. And again, I've gone down, like I had room for a bit, but it wasn't consistent enough for it to work.  I've read the, I've read the custom. Yeah. And I've read the book on the thing.

8:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Make notes, whatever the book of our book.

8:51 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. I've read that, of course, that was months ago. So now basically forgotten it. But, like, thinking about the work.  we do. And thinking about the ideas that we manage. It's like idea management, this idea management. So it's still accessible when we need it.  And maybe this is part of your obsidian view. But how do you retrieve ideas in a way that makes sense?

9:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm writing down names of people that I've seen talking about this in an interesting way. So I think my system is not amazing.  And I also suspect that systems people, we like to think about patterns that fit. And we don't really like when things are incongruent.  And we want to find the overarching rule that makes everything click together. And sometimes we're playing around with systems.  We say it's work, it's not really work. We're just playing with Lego, but the Lego is softer. So this being said, one thing I've noticed is it's becoming easier to make peace with the fact that some things fall outside, falls through the cracks.

10:25 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I also. blog post, by the way. You need to write this.

10:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I think accept what is is what I just heard. Yeah, yeah, you got to accept what is, I think.  And also, I mean. Idea people, I would suspect that have a lot of. Injected expectations about how. What's percentage of the things you get into that you should.  Like it's not difficult for somebody that has no ideas to finish 100% of the things they think about, right?  But you have a lot of ideas. Of course, you cannot keep up with the same percentage, right? By definition, you'll need to do less of all the things.  And one of things that helped me a lot was, did you know Tiago Forte from Builders of Secondary?

11:24 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

11:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the things that, I mean, it's maybe obvious, but it was the first time I saw articulating this, which is about not falling off the wagon.  It's about getting back on the wagon. I think a mix of systems thinking and loving things to make sense make us really vulnerable to the idea that once you break the streak, it was useless.  And that's not true. But I think that's like crack for our brains. to fit together really nicely when they don't is because they don't make sense.

12:05 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah this is like I did a I did so I'm trying new things right so I did oh like a workshoppy thing but this is my deck and it said momentum beats master plans for sure because the whole thing was about being stuck like so I I had four things and I took them through these questions that were basically a framework which is the grow coaching framework but the things were like being stuck is a signal not a stopping point first thing you're probably solving the wrong problem why because often we see a symptom and we try and solve it but we forget to actually go deeper and the last thing is you you can't think you're  out of a feeling problem?

13:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

13:02 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Because often trying but logic to things that actually doesn't make any sense to to think about it in that way.

13:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

13:10 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And it's okay either way but these four things ended up being it was three things and like you know what is stuck?  is stuck? What options do you have?

13:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  could you try?

13:29 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  What's the current reality? This one what people are like, what is your role in being stuck?

13:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm sure they loved it.

13:40 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, they loved it. And then the last one is what do you want to achieve or change? what can you commit to?  So that's the getting unstuck bit. So I use these cards it's funny because it was like oh look I'm going to tell you and in the trend  which is story. And then I started with this. I was like, what do you see? What's your first thing?  And people were like, I said, hands up if you see the rabbit. And people were like, and then I said, well, who sues the duck?  And I said, this is today. It's the same thing, everyone. We're looking at the same image and yet we have two very different perspectives here.

14:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah.

14:30 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  So I'm going to invite you in to take a different perspective. And they're like, oh.

14:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it's funny that that's a very visceral experience, right? And I think that if you try to... So you put them in the feeling place, right?

14:46 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. I put them in the feeling place as the start of the conversation. Because I mean, this could be applied to so many things too.  Think about a conflict conversation where... you need to navigate something that feels very difficult to have. often we don't take enough time to slow down or think about, well, what's the other perspective?  Because you're trying to meet your objective or you're trying something for you. So if you are the duck, how can you step into that rabbit perspective?  And, you know, if we have a look at the the big trends of what need skills that we need to invite people to build with AI and everything else that's happening, according to the world economic forum people.  This emotional intelligence and empathy taking is like in that top right quadrant.

15:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  sure.

15:46 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  sure. Yeah. So it's these little things that I'm always on the lookout for because we get so caught into our own thinking, right?

15:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. And I also think that, you know, when you spend a lot of your time thinking about metacognition, you start to overestimate how much other people think about metacognition, right?  They don't.

16:25 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  They don't think about how they think. No, it's instinctual.

16:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like, I did it because I did it. Yeah. And it's funny because I think that in the sense, getting too getting too fluent in metacognition thing is probably a trauma response.  Like this is not the normal people think. But at the same time, you can get something out of it.  So I remember maybe we spoke about this at some point. Yeah. at some point I was working as a product manager and I felt like a lot of my work was, you know, existing between different areas in our departments, you know, connecting things and so it made me feel that, oh, you know, my whole life of trying to avoid conflict and trying to see what people are actually saying and translate it to each other, this is helpful now.  And I was is my career just me monetizing my trauma response because I got really good at it because of it and that was...

17:36 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I'm not clapping because you have a trauma response but I'm like, wait a minute.

17:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think this is very common. think we do it all the time.

17:47 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I will 100% agree. Like one of my super skills thanks to ADHD is being able to read micro emotions.  in meetings, I can sit in a seeing, I can look around the room and I can tell you exactly where people are.  And I can notice like the slightest like little thing that happens. And I'm like, okay, well, I need to call on you next because you are not comfortable and you need to voice whatever it is.  I thought everyone experienced the world this way. And I said, I was working with the director, I was like, and what about so and so like what about it?  Did you see that? He's like, what do you mean? I was like, you didn't see it. Did you see how his whole body language changed?  you hear his tone? Did you hear how, you know, he was doing this one thing at the end of every sentence?  Did you hear that? He's like, what are you talking about? I said, we need to set up a meeting actually with him to help him process whatever that is and for him to know that he  You that you're going to support him through that And he had he did not see it could not hear it in the little things and so That in itself was able to like by setting up that meeting just created that psychological safety Within the team so he felt recognized for his contribution in the situation and that he continued to contribute Versus what I saw which was like withdrawing and like okay fine I'm really good at the okay fine thing.

19:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been working on trying not to do I think we spoke about it last week. Yeah.

19:36 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, yeah But so I mean We started talking about that to met a cognition you were talking about that so we Accepting what is you also talked about being okay with the percentage of what we finish because it's not the It's not the falling off.  It's the getting back up. That's the skill that we need to be You mentioned Tiago forte and then we also talked about medical cognition.

20:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is why you don't need an AI not like that You know because I've jotted things down as we're going because I'm like, yeah, that's good.  Yes So I've made a list actually maybe find is interesting I've made a list of Ideas concepts approaches techniques related to the productivity because The people that struggle the most with it are the people that we will know spend the most time trying to learn it and And the whole idea was The people that manage to get books out They are self selecting for people that you know get  done So if you're struggling with getting stuff done reading a book from a person that Managed to get stuff done might Not help you because they're not like you Which is a bit self-defeating, you know innocent But one of the things I was thinking and I'm sure is  original is that you need to figure out like your stack, your productivity stack, right? And I've started to just put things on a list on a spreadsheet, and I think there's like more than a hundred ideas.  And some of them are very simple like, ah Pomodoro, or this thing about, it's not about keeping on the, staying on the, staying the course, but it's about, you know, getting back and so on.  And I think the list is that long just because I worked it down, but I think anyone that spends a lot of time thinking about this, if they go through like, what are the things they come up with very largely so as well.  So, and I think this relates in an ironic way to what I've been trying to do more of mixed results, which is smaller work packages that you can ship, know, which is why like, I wanted to do like, once you  of the podcast or stuff like that, like it's done, it's done, it exists in the world and I don't spend too much time thinking about how amazing and all-encompassing it could be, right?  Oh, this is not a podcast. This is like a perspective. No, it's just a podcast. yeah, that's what I've been thinking about.

22:22 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I'm going to send it to you in the chat right now because clearly we are all thinking about the same thing and that is great.  I was going to say, here are some things for you.

22:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love things.

22:46 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I know you love the things. This is why we love connecting. I sent this to Kurt because these were some of the things that I've been looking at lately, which is  any structures? I did a course some time ago and I was like, oh, yeah, liberating structures that, you know, because I've been doing this learning design work, as I mentioned in the last call.  And so how can you apply some of that thinking to a workshop, you know, like TRIZ, which is problem solving around something so you could add the topic and then host a facilitated conversation around that.  The other thing I found was this powerful questions PDF, which I'm like, yeah, you know, the outcomes that we generate are really based on our thinking around the requirements around powerful questions.  So of course, the insight that I've just had, as I've mentioned that is, you know, all of this prompt engineering piece is about asking better questions.  So how could we take what is in that, which is about World Cafe and hosting conversations? using that as a means to do an even better job with either how we turn up for our teams, asking questions around that.  But also even on a personal level, how would that change prompt engineering? Because it's so contextual and so much around what we ask and how we frame the question determines the results.  if we get better at asking powerful questions, we could apply it both in the AI context, but also our team environment.  And the last thing is this tiny experiments podcast. So, you know, this whole thing that I've been thinking about years.  Someone's written the book because- I follow this person on Twitter.

24:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I haven't read the book. Have you read the book?

24:46 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I haven't read the book. It's ordered in at the library. So I'm gonna get it once it arrives. But this podcast was also really good and it supports thinking around your smaller packages that can help shift work.  Because- thing is around, okay, what's the hypothesis? It's the school possibility thing that I did. Like, what data are we collecting?  What's the hypothesis? How long is it? And what will we do to kind of check in and report back?  So this is her. I think that's what her book is. I haven't seen it yet. But again, there might be something interesting in there to help spark your thinking around this small is all, as my friend would say.

25:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Small is all. Yeah, another quote. Yeah, for sure. maybe, maybe it is, I don't know if this is the times.  I don't know if the vibe has shifted. But so the zero interest rates thing, and you know, everything was just about purpose or about that kind of stuff, which I think matters, but I think there was a distortion there.  And that, like, when you look at the history of mankind, that that's like a blip, really short like, oh, just do what you love and so on.

26:26 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

26:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And, but I think that era changed a little bit of our expectations of work and how to interact. I mean, some things I think will remain and are useful things and some others I think maybe were, you know, are not being corrected.  In a sense, correct is a strong word. But I also feel that there's more people talking about this like smaller instead of this.

26:56 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. Simplify less.

27:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, because like behind every utopia, there is oppression, right? If you have this idea, like, I'll create the best system for everything and it will solve every single problem.  By definition, that tool is going to be oppressive in some way. So this thing about smaller things. Yeah, I see more people talking about it.

27:22 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I feel it makes sense. It's more manageable.

27:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this is the other. Yeah, for sure.

27:27 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I mean, you can have the connections, but the other thing is to that. I think this sums it up actually, of course.  This is what I always love. Like, I find there's just been so many coincidences lately of the thing, like the conversation happens and suddenly we're like, oh, that thing.  Yeah, I read about that yesterday. Here's this idea around feeling. was stuck in the system, which is what you were just talking about.  Like, I found this yesterday. I was like, huh, that's an interesting view. And then we start to talk about it.  I was on a client call and this whole idea of activating after a workshop. Like, what does that look like?  What are the three things that you need to overcome? It was like a LinkedIn post. And I screencapped it because just I was like, oh, yeah, that's a good reminder.  I put it on a mirror board somewhere that I won't see for a while. And then I'll remember it.  And then in a client meeting, he's like, you know, well, my concern is like, how are we going to activate things after?  And I was like, you know, based on what I know. And I literally had the screencaps in, like, my viewer.  So I was like, the first thing you really need to think about is capacity. Like, what's going to change?  And how are we going to make sure that people have time to do the work? How are the leaders going to be engaged to make sure that people are given that time?  And what needs to adjust based on priorities? You know, and I just kind of rattled these things off, right?  It was like, what? All of these synchronous kind of things like find the thing and then someone asked the question.  It's weird. It's happened a lot this week. I'm a little bit in the flow, I guess.

29:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you're turned in, right? Yeah. That skill of picking up the small signals is working. So just before this conversation, I was talking to someone else, John Morley.  Mm hmm. And maybe to should meet. Yeah, I've made an I've made a note here. Because we were talking about we're talking about this.  Many things, but one. the intersections was, you know, managing and living with this capacity for having a lot of ideas and realizing only a percentage of those and finding ways of, you know, not letting that affect you or finding your power being an ideas person instead of a person that executes on every idea because that would be impossible.  And we were talking about that. And so one of the things that came up was now showing up above the line or below the line.

30:40 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  above the line is what people see.

30:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And yeah, I think you guys have similar references around coaching perhaps. So yeah, this whole thing about, you know, work identity, productivity, being creative in a world that rewards algorithmically optimized content, this whole thing.

31:00 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  it's it's a vibe right and sorry I'm anything's on my on my head but yeah uh how did we get to this I might if going into the detour I think I think the we were talking about um you know being able to think about john specifically and whether or not that would be a good introduction we were also talking about how the system isn't supporting thinking in the same way so we have and the link that I just sent was really about restoration like actual restoration and what I love also what I love about this page is just like the visuals that he has I love which is like a person in a field and like old-styling laptop with  paper lines on top and old-styling microphone backwards with letters. I'm like a hammer in a corner of what feels like a shower stall.  I love this kind of stuff.

32:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I have a whole folder on Pinterest about this stuff called Endestine. There's a vibe of CIA documents that somebody just...

32:28 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  like old-styling like someone is going to get you.

32:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

32:32 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Right?

32:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

32:36 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  But you know, thinking about the I'm done, I'm ready. I remember who I am when. That as a prompt.  So to your point, how would you ask those questions? Imagine. It's the inner call and you're going to write the declaration.  So what I've heard from you so far today. That's all. Like, how can we actually reduce versus how do we accept ideas that will never come to life, even though it's our super skill?  So the real question is, you know, what do you do more of or what do you do less of?  And how do you prioritize that? Which then begs the next question. What is the criteria for success for you?  Like, what is the good idea versus like, which one do you keep and which one do you release? So then if you zoom out, once you do some of that thinking, and you narrow it down to something that feels like, or you accept what is whatever that feels like for you, then asking this prompt with, I'm done.  What are you done with? I'm done with trying to control all of the ideas, manage them, activate them. Get them to done.  I'm done with that. That actually is not serving me. I'm ready to step into a new way of thinking that allows me to focus on one thing at a time and get it to done or create a tiny experiment that feels real for me.  I'll know this by meeting the data requirements based on the hypothesis in the time and I will not finish unless it's so incredibly painful I can't do it.  I'm ready that's what I'm ready for. The last prompt is I remember who I am when so it could be I remember who I am when I have like a jam session with you so I can celebrate the fact that the ideas haven't really gone away but I'm only focusing on the ones that matter most to me for right now based on my tiny experiment.  So the creativity piece is not gone and that's part of the joy is that you can still tap into it whenever you're ready to step back in it's just the flow of where you are but you put  in guardrails up to feel connected and feel like you're moving through things in a way that feels maybe more relevant for you.  So that's the link of or a link. It could be a or a frame to start thinking about of your one million productivity tips.  What's the one that you're going to do a pilot on? For how long and what does that mean? And you already can sift through the hundred and get it down to the top five.  Like that's the first thing is the criteria. Like, but I actually try this. Does it make sense for me to try this based on where I am or whatever kind of criteria you put together for that.  So you get it to a list that feels a bit more manageable. And then you can explore it. This idea still exists.  They're still in the spreadsheet. They're not going anywhere. It's just being about more selective. is part of what I'm hearing in our conversation today.  Being selective and intentional is the other word I hear.

36:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that productivity spreadsheet thing, it came from that observation, right now, we probably need to figure out what's our ways of being productive.  And to figure that out, I didn't see it as clear, but it is about experimenting, right? You take a few ideas and you run with them and see if they work.  And at the same time, you also probably need the ideal amount of self-coherent is not zero. There's probably a little bit that you need to push through when you're experimenting with new  have it, I would assume. So, when I started to put together that thing, I was thinking about some product, you know, like a thing, maybe like a deck of cards or something.  And I was like, okay, so maybe this is what this is, deck of cards that have been of strategies and experiment with.  Plus, kind of a log of the experiments, right? But pay attention to the failure mode of this, right? I've had this idea for more than two years.  Plus, maybe a holder for the card that we'll be committing to experimenting with, because you want things to be part of your physical life.  So maybe put it on your nightstand and it's like, oh, I wake up and I remember I'm trying to apply this idea, right?  Plus, some sort of a tracker, like am I keeping up?

37:59 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Am I not?

37:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this work? is it not? And maybe some online assessment where like, you get the whole, the whole deck, but you can, before you get the whole deck, you do an assessment, it says, probably you should start with this tree, right?  Okay. So here is where it gets meta. The idea of this as a product is interesting. I think it's also a strong signal of, oh, I think, and now I look at the world and so on.  But then it's not something that needs to be done. need to buy these things to the production of this, right?  then I don't do it. And yeah, I don't know exactly what to think about this. It's just like, it's so ironic, like you put together a bunch of productivity tips that maybe could be a product, but then you're not able to, you know, take them.  And I think one of the failure modes is making it really big. oh, this is a product with a stand and a log and a  tracker and an assessment, know, it's it's funny. So this idea, it comes from a time where I was not so aware of doing small things.

39:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And I think it doesn't have that in its DNA.

39:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like the podcast, the podcast comes from a time where this is much more internalized, like I need to do small things.  So the podcast, I don't have like bad habits of thinking about it in ever increasing mycelium kind of ways, mycelium.  So there's a kind of genealogy of one's mind that affects the ideas that we have at a certain time.  And the ideas they do carry that kind of spark, know, an idea that comes from a time where I'm thinking about ever increasing systems.  It's an idea that, you know, We'll have, sorry, I think I'm wrong.

40:02 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Why? Do not apologize. This is part of the exploration. And what I hear in what you're saying is, although you see a vision for a product, that in itself means, you know, you just talked about, you know, the point of failure mode.

40:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

40:20 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And what you're identifying is where you've been most successful is actually smaller, more discreet items like the podcast where it feels like it's concrete and it's not expansive, like that mycelium kind of idea, but instead it's like a standalone piece.

40:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's standalone.

40:41 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  It's the standalone like, oh, well, I'm just doing the podcast and this is, it's only gonna be for this long.  And after that, I'm done. And that's good because that's the experiment that I've created and it's small and I don't have bad habits related to that.  When you talked about the other pieces of the cards and having all of that information, it's not so much, well, what I'm curious about, I don't know, is this idea around, okay, well, if you were successful in that condition, right, with the stand alone, how can you apply that thinking to your first piece?  Like, so for example, the deck of cards, that seems like it's a lot. How could you make the deck of cards smaller and more achievable to year?  Like, could you do one sample one? Just do one. Like, do the one that when you look at your hundred list of things where you could just play and experiment and make it fun.  versus make it feel overwhelming like  I've got 99 other ones to do. But instead it's like the experiment itself is actually locating the one thing and starting to play with that idea a bit more specifically.  So whatever that experiment criteria is like I'm gonna like within the next two weeks Melissa, I'm going to pull an idea from the list.  And I'm going to not even design the card because that feels a bit overwhelming. I'm just going to create a form to log experiments.  And I'm going to put that idea in the log. That's it. That's all I'm doing for this. Like the log is the output.  Because the log and the definition of that log is the start of what some of the other experiments. But if I do it, if I try logging what happens,  like understanding what the experiment is and actually start to log it, then I'll have a better sense of what a tracker is that will be the next thing that might make sense for me to think through.  So I'm making it instead of like, oh I've got to do this, I've got to do this, I've to do this.  How can you make it so simple that there is no friction? That's easy. It takes less than two minutes to do.  Where's your two-minute win of the day? Based on your list.

43:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right now?

43:49 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

43:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you So, when I get time to work on the book, I would really like it. There's also another little source of wins, which is, maybe I told you, I don't remember.  So I printed out a few, like, kind of, it's not really a checklist, it's just like a statement. Can I show you this?

44:28 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  No.

44:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I printed out a bunch of them, think, 20 or 30 or something like that. And it's something I've been doing this for 13 days so far.  And it's my goal, my strategy, my tactics, ongoing initiatives and methods. I read this out loud for myself. It's funny because it's in English, but I read it for myself in English.  And the funny thing is, so the. The goal is to earn X amount of money a month as a specialist in productization via workshops, a strategy, provide a high ticket service to professional clients that have an urgent need.

45:09 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  becomes like a prayer.

45:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tactics, be presentable and confident. This is why I start wearing dress shirts and coats. Actively meet add and connect to new prospects and clients, actively ask for frozen connections, share consistently, do what I said I would.  Ongoing initiatives. There's a weekly newsletter. There's a one-off eight to ten episode podcast series and there's a book, right?  Methods. Prepare for the week. Pick three things to do and do them first, which I do with this thing.  So keep track of progress. Do not launch new things until one of the initiatives is complete, which is interesting because I'm dying to finish the podcast, not because I don't like it, but because I just want to.

46:00 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Because that's the trigger for the next thing and you're like you're done with the podcast because it's great, but it's done.

46:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

46:09 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

46:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, so I've been, I've been doing this for 13 days. I keep, I write things I've done in the past in the, in the, in the back.  And I put them in the little envelope, which is getting thicker and it's very funny because I mean none of this is like earth shattering on one go.  But it does emerge some patterns surface simple some patterns. Like I can see that I'm not exactly doing all of these things.  And I mean this in a self punishing way is just like, okay, what I thought I would do is not exactly what I ended up doing.  So he has stated preferences with preferences, but, but it also it creates a certain ritual startup boot up sequence.

47:00 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  for my day, right? Yeah.

47:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I try to, I don't get it every time, so I have a stack of them here. So at the end of the day, I close my computer and now I look at the one for the next day on top of the computer.  It's, why am I telling you about this? it's related to, this conversation is very self-referential in a sense, right?

47:26 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, no, but this is part of it, I think, because I was asking you two minute when and you're like, actually, I've got 13, I'm setting a new habit.  This is part of what you're exploring is how can habits help keep you focused and prevent me from activating new work when I really want to, right?  Instead, it's like, no, that's my goal. And this is how I'm turning up. And this is the person that I am.  So in fact, if you've read James Clear. Have you read James Clear?

48:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't finish, but I know.

48:06 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  You should listen to it. I found listening to it was better than reading it.

48:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

48:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  But fundamentally you're changing your identity and you also pulled this out by saying I wear colored shirts now because that's an identity shift for you because when you wear a colored shirt you feel more confident and more professional.  So yeah, like all of these things, you're already underway with a series of experiments. You're experimenting not only on how you turn up and how you are in the world and how you commit to the work that you do.  That's your daily thing, but also in the work itself. So what I heard is in your podcasting piece, like you're ready to move on, but you've also committed to finishing it.  So you will finish it and that will be, you'll get that big dopamine hit of like, okay, I finished and now I can move on to my next piece.  So you're working on the things you're working not only on how you see yourself in work, at least again, correct me if I won't.  How how you are, and how you turn up and how you want to be to feel confident in your work and to attract the right kinds of clients, because the person who wears a college shirt is more likely to attract the right kind of client and referrals that that's what you're asking for.

49:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, that's just we're talking about the Fatum and checking out the Fatum recordings. So the other day was checking out some recordings of Fatum.  and I was wearing a T-shirt, it was gray, like pajama gray, and my hair was not well done. And I remember looking at that, I like, yeah, but of course I'm kind of suffering because I'm not feeling it.  And I mean, it was a good conversation, it's a very cool client, we are on good terms. But these things, you know, I don't.  And I remember that I got something from James Clear, which was like every time you do one of these things, putting in a vote for the person you wanted to be.  I remember that, that stuck with me, I didn't realize I was doing that, but you brought it to my attention.  So yeah, it's really satisfying to look at the, it's, yeah, okay, the metagame of it, right? So the envelope getting thicker is a very tangible proof that I've been consistent about this.  And which is interesting if you struggle with confidence in your ability. to be consistent because now I have proof.  I've been consistent and this is undeniable. The other thing is that I think that the paper is doing a lot of things at the same time.  So in a sense, the fact that I have a stack of them ready.

51:17 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, you can choose the hurdle and the friction point by having them ready too, right?

51:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, but also they pull me back on the wagon. If I fall off the wagon and I see that because like this week I was traveling for work and there were two days I didn't do it, right?  Normally this would be the moment where I would abandon a habit because I didn't realize I was trying to keep this habit.  I think to your point of tiny experiments, you need to be aware of them. You're going through them, right?  So now I have this stack of papers and it's very easy to get back on the wagon because the wagon just asks this, every day pick a paper, put the date in and you read it out for yourself.  That's okay. And then the other things are just added benefits, right? clarity and the consistency and getting used to think of yourself in this way.  So I think that the Little Paper is doing a lot of things.

52:14 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Well, you've inspired me because I think that's one of the things that I have struggled with too. I started writing.  I started a sub-bedack and I said, okay, I'm going to go through these things and I'll share a story from my experience.

52:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I got through, I think, four of them, five of them.

52:38 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Because the friction point of, I know what I'm going to do, but I haven't committed to doing it to myself in a way.  And I think what I've heard in today's conversation is actually looking at some kind of paper prompt would be useful for me is the first thing.  Because I like you, I'm like, oh, yeah, you can tell, even in the cards that I showed you, I'm looking for something that feels a bit more grounded and yeah, physical, to make me say like, oh, , yeah, you've committed to this.  So you're in it. And evidence is, you know, outcome is the envelope getting thicker. And that feels really good.  But I also heard to you in the fact that, okay, you fell off the wagon for a couple of days, but that's okay.

53:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know why? Because the stack is still there waiting for you just pick up the next one.

53:29 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah. And you can acknowledge like, oh, yeah, that wasn't possible because of these things, right?

53:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because to me, it used to frustrate me. Like, right now, I'm trying to overwrite a lifetime of this is it and that not being it, right?  Oh, I'm going to get it now. And not getting or not getting to the level I imagine I could get.

53:54 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

53:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I feel that a big part of this is rebuilding my trust in myself of doing the things that I want to do right and the podcast is related to that and you know my newsletter is related and then I try to find ways of just trying to make it work with not a lot of friction so like for instance for my newsletter one thing that really helped was that for some reason in December I was really inspired and I wrote maybe eight editions of the newsletter in maybe two or three days there was time I was inspired and then I was like okay so I have stuff for a couple of months right and the funny thing is like my thinking has changed on those things so maybe I don't fully agree with what I'm posting now but it doesn't matter doesn't matter but this is what she says in the podcast is you put it out there and you get feedback yeah and you adapt it and then she said when I was learning about neuroscience and I posted something that was actually not correct

55:00 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  fact. And so my community told me that it wasn't correct. And I said, Thank you. You know, like, it's that kind of thing.  It's like, we're not all perfect human beings doing perfect things all the time. you know, I what I hear in that too is understanding where the friction points are.  And when you're inspired, do it. And then you have like the little backup. Yeah, it's like my duo lingo right now.  I'm literally keeping a streak alive because I've been able to like, I haven't made it a priority. And it's okay, sometimes that's just where you are.  I think the self awareness and acceptance of some things that may be challenging and acknowledging it and still doing the work.

55:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's another thing that I've heard in today's conversation. Yes, yes, I believe that I mean, there's that, you know, sometimes the guy is a little bit gringy, but Alex Ramosia has some interesting stuff.

56:12 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  No, I agree.

56:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And one of things he says is that this is what hard feels like.

56:18 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

56:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And sometimes we were like, yeah, I'm going to do it. It's going to be really hard, but let's do it.  And then it gets hard and we were like not acting as hard as it is. So yeah, this is hard.  This is what hard feels like. I don't have it now, but I used to have it like printed and pasted in front of me.  Yeah, to me, it really helps. And I think maybe for people with like big imaginations, we imagine like things to be easy, just joyful.  Yeah. And then when they aren't, we're like, oh, this was a mistake. And it's like, no, no, it's not a mistake.  It's just there's a reason why not everyone is doing the things you want to do because it's. easy. So that has been helpful.  Again, it's like a constellation of ideas, right, that you pick and choose which ones might be better for you.

57:11 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I love this idea of I'm a person with with a big imagination. It was just such a lovely way to frame it.  I'm gonna use that. I'm a professional question asker and people say I'm a person that has a big imagination.  I see possibilities for other people though.

57:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. And maybe also, I think because of the whole change in the vibe in the world vibe, we had misplaced expectations on the burden of it.  Just like, oh, it's great to be innovative and imagine it. That's great. You know, like the big five, the old  thing. So openness is correlated to neuroticism, right? So that's the price. You pay the price for being open to new things.  You're always unsure of yourself. It makes perfect sense. But I think once we start having these conversations in more realistic terms, at least to me it becomes easier, I guess.  It doesn't feel like you're weird. It's just like, yeah, you're leaving the other side of of this thing. You're like the X-Men on Marvel, know, Wolverine can die, all his friends do, so he gets lonely.  That's the thing.

58:38 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, but that's also the reality of, you know, it's the same thing in terms of there are just some things that you can't fix.  This is the other thing that I've been like. Not everything needs to be fixed. Just because you're able to maximize something and improve something.  Which is, you know, kind of the definition of being innovative is like this or something better The phrase that I would always say Some things are totally good like accepting what is is another Part of of the frame that I think I've I've really struggled with because I'm like, yeah, what about this?  Mm-hmm No, Melissa, it's fine It's actually really great as it is because that meets the requirements of whatever it is and yeah Yeah, you could you could do more you could do different and it could be better But the question of is is the juice worth the squeeze?-hmm, and that's another thing that I've been just like contemplating like Thank you brain for sharing all your one million amazing ideas and I'm putting you on pause, right?  now. It's still there. It doesn't go anywhere. If you need to jot them down to feel like you've captured them in a way, great, let's do that.  But otherwise, brain, we good. Like, go outside. Look at a tree. Tree does not struggle with being a tree.  The tree is a tree. That's that. So I'm going to leave you with that thinking and an invitation for you to go outside and put your arms around a tree and just say, Hey, guess what?  Well, good. We're here.

1:00:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're the second person today that tells me I should go get outside a little bit.

1:00:42 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, you do. connect with the the outside because it slows your brain.

1:00:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To, yeah.

1:00:52 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  That's my invitation for you.

1:00:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's a good one.

1:00:56 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And you know why you actually have to do it. That's the universe.

1:01:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's the universe. I gotta do it.

1:01:03 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Sorry. You're welcome.

1:01:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm wearing crocs.

1:01:06 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I don't want to put on shoes. That's fine. Break the rules. You can break the rules now and then.

1:01:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'll go outside. I might not hug a tree right now because it's a brush hour.

1:01:18 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Okay, don't hug a tree. Just like acknowledge the tree. Like go up to the tree with intention and be like, okay, hi.

1:01:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are we doing three?

1:01:31 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Hi.

1:01:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's going on?

1:01:33 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Trees pick up on it, man. I can tell you I've always killed so many plants in my house and I'm like, I really love you.  I'm sorry that I've neglected you. Please come back. I will be here for you. And they come back. Anyway, I leave you with that.

1:01:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's not a, not a light one.

1:01:53 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Thank you.

1:01:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is good. Yeah.

1:01:56 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  When we going to see each other? Three weeks?

1:02:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. What's happening in three weeks?

1:02:07 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  First week of May. Let's do the first week of May.

1:02:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  First week of May? Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay, I'm looking at the first week of May.

1:02:26 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Thursday is the worst day other than that. Most of Friday.

1:02:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. This time?

1:02:33 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

1:02:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which email do you prefer?

1:02:53 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

1:02:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wee.

1:03:07 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
