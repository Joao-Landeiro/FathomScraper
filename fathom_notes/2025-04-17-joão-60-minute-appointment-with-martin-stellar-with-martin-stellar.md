0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello.

0:02 - Martin Stellar
  Hey, Joao.

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi, hi. Can you hear me?

0:06 - Martin Stellar
  Yes, I can.

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, cool.

0:08 - Martin Stellar
  Good to meet you.

0:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This meeting is being recorded.

0:12 - Martin Stellar
  How have you been? Very well.

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Good. Four things going on.

0:19 - Martin Stellar
  How about you? Yeah, very good. Good to hear. Lots of things going on.

0:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. Nice.

0:28 - Martin Stellar
  How can I serve you?

0:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, So, yeah, I found you on LinkedIn. I think we chatted a little bit. And one of the things that is becoming more and more obvious on my side is that I'm bad at sales.  And I've had help before in that sense. But more and more, it becomes clear to me that it's less so about.  techniques or scripts, although those things can help if you're really behind in that competence ladder, which I think I am.  But at the end, I think that there's an inner game, which I think I've mentioned in the message, that I should fix about that.  And I think it connects with pricing, it connects with how I come across and all those things. So yeah, so when I, I think that was the most salient thing, like, oh, maybe pricing is like the signal that tells me there's, there's something there.  And the annoying feeling of, I think I'm undercharging, I think that I probably deliver more value than what I charge for it.  And there's a whole web of things. And I don't know, you felt The way you come across it feels very sincere, but not too hippy, let's say.  Like, there's a method to it and there's a rigor to it. I mean, it comes across, that's all. I receive it.  So I was intrigued by that.

2:26 - Martin Stellar
  And here we are. Okay. So you've got that right. There's there, rigor is very definitely a component. Is that something to click for you?  Like rigor is a thing in your life?

2:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's something I admire. And it's something I strive for. I'm not sure if I'm very rigorous. So I can give an example a bit more concrete.  I love creating like productivity systems. added following them after a while, you know, so there's a rigor in creating the system, but then there's not a lot of rigoring, you know, sticking to the system, that kind of thing.

3:11 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, that's a bit like me. It's just wonderful to get lost in the tinkering and the setting up and the configuring and noodling away at getting it just so.

3:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

3:22 - Martin Stellar
  It feels like it's playing with Lego, right? I know, I know. What do you, what do you sell?

3:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I help consultancies and agencies create workshops from their, from their services.

3:41 - Martin Stellar
  What do people buy?

3:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure yet. I understand the question, but I'm not sure yet because I don't think I've had too many  Miller repetitions to, to see like a definite, definitive answer, but there's a few things. So one of them was, I've noticed this with some clients, they just buy honestly working with me, I think they buy me and they're usually like very curious, very open to people, often creative.  And they just, you know, but that's, I don't know exactly how I get all the get that that's the thing they want.  I think it's because of my, where I talk to them online and I'm like not trying to sell anything and like to give value and send them links and try to, I think I'm good at understanding what makes people tick, and then I think they feel seen and like, oh yeah, let's work together.  But I don't love this, I think I like doing that work. But the part of me that likes rigors struggles with that because I know that  I'm helpful in that format, but it's always very difficult for me to say exactly what would be developed at the end.

5:10 - Martin Stellar
  What does that part rule with?

5:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let's use concrete examples. there's two specific people. One of them was really excited about creating their workshop as we start to try to formalize what they do and to figure out how to place the workshop into that.  Inevitably, other things came up because this relates to everything else around their business, like finding clients, selling the workshop and so on.  Because they are very curious and they follow all these rabbit holes. At some point, I think they changed the goal of the interaction and they didn't get all the way to developing a workshop.  But they got value from the thing. and they gave a testimonial and it was nice in that sense and they said it was really good to work together.  And there's another example which is kind of a similar position like we were trying to develop visual frameworks of their work and both the workshops and the visual frameworks they need this initial step of me figuring out how they do what they do.  So in this second case we did arrive at visual frameworks like a couple of them they're really happy oh my god all of this gave a testimonial all the whole thing but they I don't think they've really used them.  So in a sense I think that they got value but I think the value that they got was around having a cool conversation and I think that's a difficult thing to sell and to charge for the time that he takes to get to that conversation.  So that's the tension for me. I think I'm okay at those interesting conversations, but I think they are the difficult thing to sell and I would like to sell more involved things, more finalized things that I think people would be more open to buying.

7:15 - Martin Stellar
  How many clients have you done this kind of work for in total? Six, something like that. What is typical price?

7:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Around $1,000 for four to six sessions of one and a half hours.

7:44 - Martin Stellar
  Do you create output or is the purchase your time?

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's my time, but there's always like tidying up things. There's a little bit of after work, most of the work is inside of the sessions.

8:05 - Martin Stellar
  But you don't create deliverables and things like that.

8:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I do create deliverables. Yeah, actually I do. mean, some of them are pre-made up to a point, but there's always some adaptation.

8:20 - Martin Stellar
  Which are ideal buyer?

8:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I believe that my ideal buyer is an hypothesis right now. So both of these kinds were kind of the sole independent kind of thing.  And I think my ideal buyer is probably more like an agency or a small consulting firm. Someone that has not an itch to scratch with like a problem to solve, right?  And I'm still getting my bearings on the specific taxonomies of these, like the agencies. There's all sorts of different kinds of agencies that do all sorts of different kinds of things.  MR make more sense for the kind of work I do. For instance, if it's an agency that sells ads, I don't think that's a good fit because it's not something that deals with a lot of complexity where workshops could help.  But if you're like a development agency, maybe this makes more sense because there's a lot of complexity around the client's business and the product they're developing and so on.  And I'm aiming at smaller agencies. And I think the reason why I'm aiming at smaller agencies is honestly maybe I'm playing it safe or I recognize that there's still work to do in terms of like how I come across to be able to land work at more sophisticated businesses.  And I think that's it. Yeah, that's what I got.

9:50 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. And so this is your only revenue source at the moment? Or how does your business work?

9:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's not. But so no, no, I understand the question. think it's a valid question. I do different things, but this is the thing I'm trying to get more work from.  I'm trying to step away from the creative generalist position. As a creative generalist, I get all different kind of things, like from other, like more local businesses, people that know me, friends, family, stuff like that.  So that I think most of my revenue comes from that. And then I'm trying to break into this. OK, let's make a business out of the workshops for experts.

10:42 - Martin Stellar
  OK, well, part of the reason I'm asking is also because of just economics, right? don't know what you've seen of my website and stuff, but I'm kind of like expensive or in Brazil, economy.  and your, your only revenue would be clients at 1000 bucks. Well, then your cost of access to get to work with me is out of balance with your revenue.

11:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But if you have other sources, understood.

11:15 - Martin Stellar
  So basically, cost of access, that means to say the, the most accessible solution is the training that's $3,000.

11:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just for context, you know, for sure, for sure. And what do I think about that? Well, first, I think it's, it's a very relevant point to bring up.  second, is I did browse your website. I didn't find that. Maybe I should have browsed it deeper. It's not entirely something that feels unexpected.

11:57 - Martin Stellar
  Okay.

11:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think My biggest, my biggest, um, you can tell that I'm not to experience at this, right? So I probably have, like, beginner questions and beginner hiccups and stuff like that.  And I think most of my, like, objections, so to say, are around. And I, can I apply the stuff?  You know, I think that's a thing. So what's the difference? I'm very, I'm very aware that it's very different to like read a book or work with someone that's, that's clear to me.  But I think my big hiccups around, you know, spending money are what kind of results or I don't even like the word to like guarantees or what kind of things like this reduce the risk.  And of course, this makes even more sense compared like when it's relatively proportional. at least more expensive for me than it would be for the people.  And maybe I'm really not a fit. Right now it seems that I'm not.

13:10 - Martin Stellar
  I've not meant to imply that. In fact, if we take away the money side of it, so far you tick all the boxes in that you engage with questions.  that looked at that point of being coachable, which is very important because what you're telling me at the start about the kind of work that you want to do where you just sell the session, in a sense you are coaching.  If you want to be a good coach, you have to be coachable. And it seems like you might be.  If you want, do you know much about coaching? Are you familiar with the methodologies and the frameworks?

13:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I took a long course on it. Um, but I didn't get to the ICF, um, that was, oh, that wasn't CF.

14:06 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah. Yeah. Don't don't.

14:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but it was like 180 hours, something like that. Over eight months.

14:15 - Martin Stellar
  I mean, to say that the accreditation, it's, it's helpful. It doesn't doesn't do enough to merit the post and the effort trainings that they have, I'm sure are good.  But it's, it's a good organization, but as a coach, you don't need the accreditation or any accreditation. And it's especially good for people who are in the, just as a side bar, ICF, accreditation and similar are very good for people who are in the life coaching space.  Because that stuff is hard to sell. And so the more labels and badges you can show, the better, hopefully it's going to be.  Life coaching is notoriously difficult. There's a book. that is going to make a big difference. I highly recommend it.  It's fun, it's easy, it's not too long, Stan.

15:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I highly recommend it. Did you mention a book on LinkedIn?

15:18 - Martin Stellar
  May have. I don't think I've mentioned that one. The second thing, my impression so far is...

15:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love this book. Sorry to interrupt.

15:33 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, a really good book. I like it. Really good. The second thing that strikes me is that you seem very young.  I mean, you don't look like you're 19, but you're not 40 either. I'm 38. You're 38. Right, so that explains just your way of thinking.  You have a very thoughtful way of processing and formulating. So you have a writer's mind, I would say. And that's helpful, because a lot of the work that you do is writing either in messaging, in emails, in an article, in your LinkedIn posts, or in your head before you go into the next conversation and you pre-write how things might go, how things went in the past.  A lot of the work is putting words in places. Once you learn how to do that with precision and rigor in terms of, like, I have this business partner and I keep forgetting, she keeps forgetting that you don't call something a thought partnership.  Together work in the family business space and so it's a, you know, generational transitions and things like that. people sometimes, if you're 65 and you're about to hand over your business, you have a lot on your mind and a lot to figure out in projects.  So what somebody like that needs, you need somebody to talk to, to help you figure out to make sense, make decisions, a thought partner.  But if you then describe it as, let's continue our conversation on the thought partnership. Here's a proposal on the thought partnership.  That person is then going to go to his spouse or her boss or whatever sister. Yeah, there's thought partnership that I'm thinking about from this coach, thought partnership.  You don't need my pay 30,000 pounds to have somebody help you think. Talk to me, I'll help you think.  And then your sales breaks, your sale breaks because it's the wrong label. Yes. Alignment fees for generational transition. Okay, now we have something.  And so how you work words and the way you formulate things and if you are paying attention, you can see that I'm being very intentional and deliberate in how I'm expressing myself at this moment.  That kind of treatment of how you try to relate and convey things to people, either in saying or in asking, asking is very, very important, that's at the foundation of how you get better at sales.  So you are always looking for the best way to calibrate your messaging to the individual in front of you.  And so, you know, there's all just a very long-winded way to say, well, you're already good at that. So now just learn how to do it in function of sales and then you'll be fine.  You know, you seem, you seem, you seem like a good fit for what I can tell so far.

18:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Long story.

18:49 - Martin Stellar
  Includes lesson.

18:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Don't forget it. Come again?

18:52 - Martin Stellar
  Long story. Includes lesson.

18:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Don't forget it. Oh yeah. Yeah, no, no, I think it's, I think the I think the first message I sent you on LinkedIn from a potential approach kind of signal that, yeah, I can see that there's a lot of lot of intention in the way you speak.  Okay. So here's what I'm reading. I think you're being very generous right now. you're giving me hints on where to look.  I have two cameras. I will look at the one. And that's very valuable. I think so one of things I started to do was I started to interview more people and, you know, biggest thing I got out of my coaching.  of course, like practice careers. And I've heard other people that are good at sales and service sales mention that the question asking is really important.  And if I'm naturally curious, I'll probably have a good thing to start with. And I'll trust you to steer this conversation in the best way.  But I think the recognition that these more practical skills of how to ask questions, how to be curious, how to look for signals and what's in between the lines and stuff like that, I feel that, OK, I can at least sense my level of awareness of that.  Hence, I think my problem is like the inner game. And I think that's also what made me message you at the time because I felt, as you know, there's a lot of people talking about sales, they will, you know, get different profiles.  I like your profile the best. this inner game of sales, it's, it's, uh, it's really to confidence. I like, I think at the last year or so, less than last year, I started to realize that I've been trying to build up confidence by building up competence.  But the analogy that I've built in my head, it's like, you know, climbing a mountain because you want to see what's at the top.  As you climb that mountain of a specific competence hierarchy, you see other mountains. You see that, oh, this is, you know, mountain range.

21:56 - Martin Stellar
  And you see other mountains that you haven't climbed. so building confidence from

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then at some point it's like shooting myself in the foot I'm just more aware of things I don't know.  And so spiritually I think that's where I am right now.

22:11 - Martin Stellar
  Okay so this is this is really good because what I remember from your first message you were saying yeah it's a lever called leverage when a bunch of years ago I was really annoyed because I had this offer and I was trying to promote it and had my daily emails and maybe somebody would buy it but then guys it is so affordable you and you you're not buying it like what the hell and I said you know what I'm just going to double the price because if people don't buy it at ten dollars well it's a lot nicer to not set it at ten dollars to not set it at twenty dollars than to not set it at ten dollars so from one day to the next  double the price. And what that did for my mindset, and I did the same thing with my private coaching, the one-on-one coaching, which, you know, I started that at 6,000 for a quarter, and then I went to 12,000 and 15,000, and people wouldn't pick it up.  I'm like, well,  it, if they're not going to buy it, I'm just going to charge 25,000. So I went to my website, and I said, it's 100,000 per year, 25k minimum, you know, one-quarter minimum commitment, because if they're not going to pay 15,000, I might as well ask 25,000.  It was a lot nicer. And since then, I've been on an upward curve of increasingly senior people, that, know, because I always used to focus on the artists, but after that, I became founders and startups and freelancers, because I like people who are courageous and try to do the hard thing.  But it's also difficult, because the smaller the entity,

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the more difficult it is to find people to pay.

24:03 - Martin Stellar
  And so in that phase, and it went along with other things, rebranding, writing the book, building a new website, everything sort of evolved into a much more mature authority positioning, including the habit build, like a really wonderful experience last week, because I was introduced to someone.  Can you help our sales team get better? We've fallen off a cliff. we're six months, we need to be busy, ready for the busy season in September, and it's 12 people, workshop in America, workshop in London, bus coaching, maybe 20,000, 40,000 for the whole project.  And he goes, yeah, okay, go and talk to my leadership team, see what they think. Okay. And then I realized how much of a lift it's going to be, how much  work it's going to be. have to organize private, you know, one-on-one coaching with 15 people through summer. I have to build two custom workshops because in each territory, they have different challenges.  I have to travel to the States, get a visa, spend the time flying. I have to also coach the director, actually, because it starts with leadership.  I also have to coach leadership team. And I have to create a monthly training session aside from the workshops.  So I'm sitting there thinking about how it's going to, well, eat up my next half year. It's going to be my main client for six months, five months.  I know if I can, if I can land the deal. So I got back to him and I go, Peter, I have a problem.  A couple of things that we need to talk about. First is skeleton in the closet. And he goes, Oh, what's he gonna tell me?  He's I am not convinced. just about working with pharma, they're a pharma branding research agency, is of ethical concerns in the industry.  they're like, Oh, that's a very fair question. Here's my reply. Here's how we treated it. We hired somebody because they want to market a fentanyl lollipop.  Okay, Peter, you have the right values. Yeah, I know, like, how wrong can you be?

26:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's, yeah, that's the new just sorry.

26:27 - Martin Stellar
  So I saw his values are in place. And then I said, second thing is that I made a promise to myself to not work with employees, to work with leaders, and maybe then also with their employees.  But a business problem is a human problem. problem is a leadership problem. We start with you. Otherwise, I can't do it.  And because yeah, that's great. You should coach my leadership team as well. Okay. Yeah. And finally, we have a problem that because of the heavy lift of this, the size of the problem, the limited time scale  So we're looking not at 20 to 70, but more 140 to 180,000. I don't know there's going to be a problem.  And he goes, well, yeah, that's a deal breaker because our profit is scheduled for a million and a half this year, projected.  Well, what if we do a fixed fee and we do a contingency earn out based on your sales, your growth?  He goes, yeah, great. Talk to my financial director. So I've never worked with numbers that big. I've made the proposals.  I've given people five, multi-five figure numbers. Now we're in six-figure territory. This has gotten close to a quarter of a million, actually, in how much I'm asking for, not in the proposal yet.  And I was just talking to my mastermind group about it this morning, how surprising it is to have gone from $6,000 per quarter in just a few years, really, four or five years.  But to now be throwing numbers like that. out. And a large part of the reason that I have the goal, and well, okay, so one reason is that I'm just to go to them all to give a damn any longer, like my age, I'm 52, I don't give a damn you, you don't have the money go away.  It's like, like, we don't have the budget for that as we have to pay somebody for advertising or whatever.  Go enjoy your problems. Just too old to care.

28:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And enjoy your problems. That's a good, yeah, like, all right, I don't. Yeah, sorry, I interrupted your purchase.

28:47 - Martin Stellar
  Just making a note because that should be an article. Problems. So that's the one thing I'm too old to care.  It's too short to deal with people who don't have their head in the right space to make the right decisions for their business and their future and their people.  And the second very large component is simply having put a number on me, 100K per year and said, well, this is now it, this is what I stand for, this is what I do.  And from that has come a change in attitude and has come a different narrative and has come a laser focus on people to ignore.  So now I don't just cleaning up my pipeline today. I'm like, well, that's a solo trader. He's a startup.  So it is filtering down, focusing on the people where you can say a number like that and they don't fall off their chair.  Another component is that I've really internalized the value of the kind of work that I do. If I can take a company from one and half million in profit to maybe two million in profit over the course of a year or two years, that makes a big difference for those 30 people in the company or 40 people.  That is something that they can do things with. For me to then say, well, I'll take a fifth of that increase.  If you want the increase or not, the value that it produces, which it can, if you work with me on that kind of intensity, and you have that kind of resources to work with.  So my attitude and the way I step into a conversation is like, yeah, how badly do you problem solved?  How much is it worth to you? Because in monetary terms, oh, and also in culture, let's turn over a better pro.  activity, less friction in the team, the upshot of what you buy is huge. It's enormous. And my prices are commensurate with that.  If you look at general electric, don't know, 1995, they were worth 500 billion. 20 years later, they were worth only 200 billion.  Now imagine, a consultancy firm could have saved how many billions they could have saved revenue in value if they would have come in and made the right changes.  Imagine everything that got lost because it didn't happen in that way. Mortgages that, you know, houses were repossessed, kids didn't go to college, people didn't get their divorces.  close factories, because that shrinkage, an enormous part of the American economy was damaged. To go in and do a job like that, you might say, well, I'm a consultant.  I can work with them for a million a year, really, for a $500 billion company, you're going to charge just a million a year.  How much money do you save these people when you work for them for a year? Far more than a million.  How much money does it make you make them to get your help? You should price commensurate with the amount of value that you create.  So for me, that is on a much different scale. I don't work with corporations like that, but I have very much internalized the importance of appreciating what the outcome is worth.  And if a buyer doesn't appreciate that, it's the wrong buyer. That does not mean that I should lower my prices.  Now, if you translate all of that over to you, you create a course for a small agency with five people, maybe 15 people in a team.  You spend six hours talking to them and they have a roadmap, they have messaging, they have They know what to do and how to build it, like is that the kind of package?

33:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, they get, it's like a workshop in the box. So they get the assets to run the workshop. And so this could be canvassing and stuff like that.  And they get like the instructions, instructions on how to do it. And we trade it one or twice. So they feel more confident.

33:24 - Martin Stellar
  So they get all the assets and instructions to build a high quality workshop that they can charge money.

33:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, to run the workshop. They get the format. So it's not that I teach them how to build it.  I build it with them. But then they get everything they need to run it themselves. And they can charge for that.  Yeah, for sure.

33:54 - Martin Stellar
  So we're talking two hours, full day, whole weekend, whatever kind of workshop they once they can send that to their list and sell that and they get what 500 per attendee?  500 per person?

34:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, 500 per person at the lowest end. yeah, then it gets bigger than that. But this usually is more for small groups.  basically, the thesis is you need to work together with your clients, but you maybe don't know how to do that, because that's kind of a porous frontier.

34:42 - Martin Stellar
  The thesis is you must have fallen on your head because your thousand dollars is way too little. If your client builds the workshop and runs it once for five people, they've recovered their investment at 500 pounds.  dollars per person two and a half times over with just one workshop and they have a workshop they can run every week if they want to they have a workshop that they can expand and charge double for whatever so the amount of value that you create with those six hours is much much higher than a thousand that you charge thank you for saying that in the many ways that you said it and yeah I mean I think I'm intellectually aware of that and then when it's when the time comes to you know put the number on the proposal and I think that's that's my hiccup but let's play again it's called emotional pricing emotional pricing okay so you are charging a thousand  dollars, US dollars, right?

36:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

36:04 - Martin Stellar
  If I said Canadian, how does that number feel? How do you feel about that?

36:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It feels... I'm overthinking it. It feels something that people that could say yes to, but less than what it's worth.

36:34 - Martin Stellar
  That's what you're thinking. That's not the feeling.

36:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's the feeling? Conflicted maybe?

36:44 - Martin Stellar
  Is this a feeling? Okay. Okay. What if you would charge 2000? How does that feel?

36:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Less conflicted, but still conflicted, perhaps.

36:54 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah.

36:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think But at the stage I'm at right now, we're still playing the game.

37:04 - Martin Stellar
  How do you feel about 3000?

37:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Better, but still living money on the table, I think.

37:10 - Martin Stellar
  Let's look at 6000.

37:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now I'm starting to feel more satisfied. And I could, I don't, I feel that if there's more I could charge.  doesn't feel as much that I'm just being silly about it. just like there's an X level.

37:30 - Martin Stellar
  But with 6000 you feel, what was the word you said?

37:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  More satisfied, more at peace, yeah.

37:38 - Martin Stellar
  If you would charge 10,000, how would that feel?

37:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Really good. Like, valid, I think.

37:50 - Martin Stellar
  15,000.

37:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Distinguished in my word.

38:02 - Martin Stellar
  It's going to take a while.

38:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How about $25,000? $25,000, it feels right now. It feels like a good ceiling. And I feel ceiling for saying this to you, but that's what it feels right now.  Like, oh, it's good ceiling. I'll be happy to be there.

38:28 - Martin Stellar
  So the way this game works is that typically people will quickly... No, actually, let's go for $50,000. What does that feel?

38:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A bit of imposter.

38:45 - Martin Stellar
  Right. So your sweet spot is somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000. Moment when you go, oh, couldn't, that's an imposter.  That is the upper ceiling. The number below that is the floor, where your sweet spot is actually somewhere there in terms of how you emotionally relate to the value that you create.  While you are all thinking about things or overthinking things or trying to be reasonable or on a subconscious level, psychologically, emotionally, 25,000 is actually just and justified and reasonable.  Maybe attainable, who knows? But at the very least, there's something that you feel comfortable with. There you were working with a thousand bucks a month per client.  Because rationally, mentally, the inner game, dominated by how you think about things, kept you to much lower limit.

39:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, okay, this is very good. What, in your experience, what's holding me back is this overthinking and then the actual, right?  I mean, it has been holding me back on many things.

40:15 - Martin Stellar
  all of us, I'm the same. Yeah, it's maybe not so much holding you back. It's just that it's, it's very difficult to make sense, to actually reason well, logically.  It's very easy to fall into opinions and constructions that are actually complete BS. And then we think that we're making sense.  You see this in martyr syndrome, when people are always justifying their martyr behavior. Oh, I have to help people.  No, you're hurting yourself. You're sacrificing your business time in order to help somebody who doesn't even have. gratitude to do anything for you.  This person that you're trying to help is a taker. Yeah, but they need my help. Okay, so now you're just not making sense.  You just don't want to see sense. And that is something that when you try to solve challenges like this, you know, confidence, pricing, getting a sale, and you approach it from where you are now, you know, everything that brought you here.  Yeah, then you have to try and think your way out of this box and the opinions and the fears and concerns that you have, and then the thinking becomes a limitation.  At some point you realize, like I did, that you just don't care anymore, and you're just going to do what you want and say what you want and ask for what you want.  You stop thinking about it because then you'll figure it out later. Now, what happens at that point? What happened when I said 100k per year is that I now have to figure out how to make that happen I now had to live up to that new statement, which means no time for artists and freelancers and startups Faster disqualification process if people the harder rules of engagement and Because I cannot afford to keep doing the things that Looking for like, okay, so I live an hour from Malaga And I love going there we have these meetups with the entrepreneurs and Every two weeks we spent the breakfast and you talk for two hours.  It's great. Great people and At some point last year I started wondering should I try and develop business opportunities there because it's close Don't have to go to ebb and bro or Lisbon But after a few weeks I realized yeah, there is too little  here. Everybody is either a startup or it is a Google or Microsoft or an Oracle with a Malaga base.  Not my people, not on either side. And I don't have time anymore because I now have this 100k per year offer and I'm not going to sell the Malaga.  So now I have to figure out how to actually make that possible. So the inner game is not just a matter of how you think and how you process your internal mechanisms.  It's also about making decisions and doing things. And then you have to  around and figure out how to make it happen.

43:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you

44:01 - Martin Stellar
  One of the funny thing you should do next, go for it.

44:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the funny thing is that, that I know this is both me and friends and sometimes clients.  I find this tendency of trying to solve things with like solution, right? Just don't address the thing, just create something else that is a bit more tangible to work towards the thing.  Like, instance, to make it very concrete. Okay. I've heard myself say that about the 25k, right? And then I was like, hmm, okay, how to make this happen.  My first, the first place where I went to was like, yeah, I'm joining these communities of digital marketers. And then I was like, yeah, everyone there is kind of trying to sell.  So I'm very aware that everybody, everyone says they don't have the money. I mean, to execute on that vision of 25K, mean, that is not the path.  But automatically, what's easy for me is to think about a new thing that is just a continuation of the old thing, right?  It feels like progress, but we're not changing the territory of this. So, yeah, so there's that. About next steps.

45:39 - Martin Stellar
  Have you considered the training?

45:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's difficult for someone to have better ROI on the training when they start from $4,000. So that's that's very convincing.  So now I have some questions. is around. So here's my reading of the situation. think it doesn't seem like I'm your ideal client, I think you're being generous and I'll take it.

46:12 - Martin Stellar
  No, I like you. I like the way you engage with this. Okay, so here's sales lesson. You have to spend time and money in order to find strangers and convert them into buyers.  If you want that to be continuously improving and easier, and you want it to be lucrative, you want to narrow your aim down as much as you can.  You want to be as precise and exclusionary as you can in your expense, time that you spend looking for people, engaging with people.  That doesn't mean you should have the door closed for everybody else. So you aim narrow, but you welcome wide.  So you're branding, you're messaging, you're positioning, you're targeting the narrative that you put out there. It's all geared towards a certain, very specifically defined avatar.  If then somebody comes out and says, hey, oh, what about me? you help me? And you see no red flags and you like this person or this company and you think it would be a fit?  Why not? Why would I turn you away? Just because you don't have a 12-person company? No, you have the psychology, the psychological markers that make it a fit.  You are coachable from how you are engaging here. It's not because I'm being generous, like money. I like working with people who give me money when I like the people.  So that's it.

47:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect, thank you. Okay, tell me more about how you say it's a quarter minimum.

47:59 - Martin Stellar
  How does it work? training. The training is a separate program.

48:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so coaching that's very unlimited access, etc, etc, etc.

48:09 - Martin Stellar
  Training is 16 weeks, where I take you through the whole sales for nice people system. So you will learn specific questions and things like that.  But you're not going to get the typical sales training, the structures and the scripts and the frameworks that you know, you have to 12 ways to handle the objections and four ways to say, no, we take it too much higher level in terms of the ethos and the methodology of engaging with people in a way that they like, and that causes them to want to buy.  it is both philosophy, it is a method of communication, communication framework. And so over the course of six weeks, we go through each of the modules by 16 weeks.  You listen you explain you ask and you profit and so there's three modules in each of those So that then is the training section weekly is 20 minutes because it's in the end.  It's very simple It's just really human nature. Just have to understand how the pieces fit together in the second 40 minutes Call that is where we coach you on your deals or on your preposition or on you can say hey I've made a new website a new page.  We look through the copy and see how we can tweak Do it right in the act? We can also be Discussing product stack so to have different tiers whatever it is that needs to be addressed But it's a deal or preparing for an offer You bring that to the coaching section.  So it's a hybrid of teaching and coaching and And and you get to send me messages anytime you want if you have slack channel, so if you have questions then  there every day, five days a week to answer any questions in between the sessions. And it does not come with a guarantee because I cannot control what happens and who shows up in your world.  But yeah, it works. I had a funny experience a couple of weeks ago. A friend who read my book and decided to quit his work at the agency.  Because he's like,  it. like sales. I'm going to quit. Take some time off and do this. So he started out for myself.  So he took a couple of months. He's like, hey, Martin, I'm back. I want to start looking for clients.  I said, okay, do the minor network exercise, minor, minor network for opportunities. That's really not a spreadsheet. I started looking at messaging to send each of these people.  This is just a friend that was helping. Within a few weeks, his former employer hired him to coach his replacement, to mentor his replacement for $100 a month.  And the next sale was from a former client. I think. I'm not sure if it was a client or a known employer as well, who hired him to do ad-word campaigns for $5,000 a month.  He went from being an employee to suddenly having $5,000 a month in recurring revenue from only one client. Because this stuff works.  If you bring the right attitude and willingness to do scary things, which in this instance he really was able to do the scary things, then it should get to results.  Is it $1,000 a month? Is it $5 I don't know. Is it the 10,000 workshop program? I don't know, but it should work and it's going to change things.

52:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you have like specific starting dates or we can start anytime?

52:18 - Martin Stellar
  Start tomorrow?

52:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well Monday.

52:23 - Martin Stellar
  Why are you asking?

52:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I was thinking about if this is like cohorts or if there's like a waiting list.

52:32 - Martin Stellar
  I was thinking about that kind of thing. No, I do plan to have a cohort based program at some point, but that's not in the pipeline yet.

52:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this training program for 16 weeks, what was the price of it?

52:51 - Martin Stellar
  $3,000.

52:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  $30,000?

52:54 - Martin Stellar
  No, $3,000. But you can pay me 30 if you want. I won't put up a fight.

53:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it a full straight up like in one go? Before the service?

53:22 - Martin Stellar
  By the way, the way to go. That's one of the first things I teach.

53:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I'm convinced of this. I'm like actually convinced of this. Emotionally still struggle with it. But it makes sense to me from both sides of the aisle.  So I'm trying to know what I'm feeling right now. Because I people have told me that my body language is like an open book.  So there's no point in. This seems to make sense to me. I trust you.

54:00 - Martin Stellar
  It would be a bad idea, or it would be a mistake.

54:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, thank you. I think that there's a sense of it. It's funny, it's a power of saying things out loud.  I think there's a sense of it, like, oh, if I do this and I don't improve, I will feel that there's less place to hide.  I'm like, truly, genetically incompetent at this.

54:35 - Martin Stellar
  I think that... Okay. Uh-huh. That's interesting.

54:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So by, I totally understand that deepening your feet is not a strategy. That's not the way to do it.  But at the same time, it provides with a certain escape route in terms of difficult conversations with yourself. I've had coaching before and it was useful for the things, not for sales.  Okay. I think this is my biggest thing in my mind right now. The elephant in the room. My questions are less about how much you know about this.  I'm more about my capacity to, you know, apply the thing. In that sense, the gravitas that I've mentioned helps.  Because I think I respect that. There's a tension that I aim to please, right? And the gravitas pulls me in that direction.  It's a good sign. Actually I'm leaning towards yes and just telling myself back not to, you know, walk back a decision.  But to me it's making more sense than no sense, it's making more sense than, it's more yes than no.

56:17 - Martin Stellar
  Who'd make it a hell yes?

56:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, good question.

56:22 - Martin Stellar
  You bet. I do this for a living.

56:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What would make it a hell yes? I don't know. If it included some sort of hyper target lobotomy into the nerve centers of self doubt, but that's if gone.  Yeah, I don't know. don't know.

57:01 - Martin Stellar
  I honestly, I don't know what else you could put on the on this That would increase the How appetizing it feels right now, so that's it's very good The reason I'm asking is because one of the tenets in the system Is that if it's not a healthy as it's now it's one of the rules that I live by in all kinds of ways Derek severs Derek severs because there ain't no such thing as a hell maybe Like either completely committed and your clients your buyers should also be completely committed And this is one of the reasons why a high price is leverage Because when you make yourself affordable and accessible your decision Wow, you know their decision to hire you become something that Should we put this thousands dollars here or should we put it there?  Well, you know workshop is useful You know, let's do the workshop thing with Schraub, okay? So your purchase becomes a trivial decision to lower the prices.  When you would go and say it's 5,000, 10, or 25,000, now the decision is, guys, we need a meeting about this, because this fucker is asking us 10,000, do we really need a workshop that badly that we want to allocate 10,000?  Now, your decision becomes way too significant and important, becomes a topic of conversation. That means that unless they can all agree that they need this and it's worth that much money, they're not going to buy.  That filters out people who are not completely hell, yes, that ends you up with only people who are completely bought into change.  And coaching, it's called being a customer of change. And the change in this case is a coaching outcome, it is a workshop, but still something is going to change.  a buyer is a customer of change the happier that buyer is the more they're going to participate the more they're to follow your guidelines the better the outcomes and the more benefit in terms of testimonials and introductions oh and repeat purchases somebody is lukewarm about a purchase is not as likely to buy again or recommend you as somebody who is it was a real tough decision i had to talk to all my friends and advisors but in the end i'm the decision i'm so happy that i did and that's why it has to be a hell yes or no it's funny that you've made it much closer to a hell yes why yeah you're good at this for sure for sure um okay think it out loud  I do have to leave, by the way.

1:00:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah.

1:00:03 - Martin Stellar
  Sorry. It's an hour already?

1:00:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, that's us. Okay. I'm leaning towards yes, but I always resist saying a final yes on a call. Good.  Because that happened before I had to walk it back. didn't like it. But I'm leaning towards yes, and is there like a Stripe link or how do you charge for this?

1:00:25 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, have PayPal link. Here's what we can do. I'm going to give you a journey prompt, something to think about, to see if this is a yes or no.  And then can you send... Do you have time for that tomorrow to do some reflection?

1:00:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I do.

1:00:43 - Martin Stellar
  And then can you send me a message at the end of the day saying that it's a hell yes or a not now?  And if it is a hell yes, I'll send you a payment link and then we can started.

1:00:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. I'm even putting like the... OK, OK, ready for the front.

1:01:09 - Martin Stellar
  OK, um. OK. I want this and I am willing to pay. Or expand, no, pay, I want this and I'm willing to pay.  And obviously the number is going to be. in there at some point. after the number, oh no, actually, this is the wrong prompt.  is a discovery dozen, and we don't have time for that. That discovery dozen is where you quickly write down the answer to 12 similar questions, same questions to dig into your subconscious, and that pay would be what you have to give up the non-monetary payments in terms of courage, terms of breaking out your network, but we'll do that some other day.  The journaling prompt that you can work with. Well, I think a useful one. If I do this, what will I have to give up, and in what way will I  Would I prevent success? Now, what I usually do, I just sit with a cup of coffee in a nice place and I write until I feel complete.  And that doesn't mean the question has to be answered. It's an abstract kind of point where you go, yeah, that's it, we're done here.  If you did answer the question, maybe not. But it is about thinking on paper, it's about going through the exploration.  And if, at the point that you're complete, you feel that, yes, this is a hell yes, then you're done, you know?  And otherwise, we can talk again later in the year.

1:03:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If I do this, what will I have to give up and in what way will this prevent success?

1:03:43 - Martin Stellar
  In what way would I prevent success?

1:03:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, okay, okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. I like this style.

1:04:00 - Martin Stellar
  journey from this. It's very, very powerful.

1:04:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the cards.

1:04:07 - Martin Stellar
  Me too.

1:04:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much. I don't want to hold you anymore. This was very good. you.

1:04:13 - Martin Stellar
  My pleasure. I hope that it's going to be a hell yes, because this was fun and I can tell that you're going to have a massive break.

1:04:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me know. I feel that way too. Okay. Thank you. a nice one. See you soon. Take care.
