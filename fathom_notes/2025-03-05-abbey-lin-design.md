0:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, yeah, I'm here. Hi. are you?

0:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How are you doing? How was your holiday?

0:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it a holiday?

0:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Or is it a break?

0:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  no. Yeah.

0:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

0:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so you might have heard.

0:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Carnival is a big deal here in Brazil. Yeah. Yeah.

0:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, so yeah, we East, which is, uh, it's kind of really tropical. And it was very nice. was very hot.  I got on a burn for sure.

0:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You look a little darker, but I don't know if it's like, yeah.

0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I got some.

0:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's the way I usually look, but the credit is not as sunny. yeah.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You just came back from Europe, so that's how you had lost your sight. Yeah, yeah.

1:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

1:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very good.

1:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So, um, yeah today, so the tech team, I don't know if I should actually invite Yvonne into this because the tech team has actually gotten pretty far since you guys went on holiday and that they are actually now almost done with controls, I think they'll be done.  They're looking for designs for third party management. and, uh, let me actually, because I see him offline, let me ping him on Slack.  Yeah, so he who is saying that we need to get third party up and like design that I think we do have.

1:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure the status because we did discuss it.

1:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I have also discussed So with like Hydro Rain and like Ocar Horizons who both really care about third party too and they're happy to kind of give some input if we have like some drawings and whatever before we go to code, but he kind of ideally will get like him a design very soon because they're close to being done with controls.  Probably this week they'll be done with controls. So that's so I don't know how where we left it with third third party and where I don't know where Romeo is either.  So I won't be able to make the 3030 call today because I have a parent teacher conference, yeah, it'd be good to kind of get an update on that process and where do we need to do third party management to get it up and running.  Got it.

2:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have started to draw that here. You see my screen. Yes. So, and let me see, let me check the JIRA as well.  Okay, so in terms of the third party management, we what we've discussed was, can I open the, let me share this, so we have 45 compliance map, then controls.  Okay, welcome to, okay, I need to log in. I always use that message if sent me once, Brighton with the details.  I have it here, I have it here. I've pinned that message, I always use it. Controls. Okay. Okay.

4:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  this one, I just had like, yeah, so the controls, I was saying, even this controls is not updated, but even you're saying that it's going to be updated pretty soon, so that we need to get started moving on the third party management.  Yeah.

4:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  on.

4:36 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Which controls are not updated? G controls.

4:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Can you open G, can you click on G?

4:43 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  And which... Oh, there they are.

4:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They just showed up.

4:45 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

4:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, we added them.

4:47 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Borna didn't sync your organization, Abby, so he added it in after you asked me, we had it in digitalization, but now it's in yours.  It should be visible, yeah. Okay. I'll of course, if some text needs changes or something. Okay. Brighton, can you also have a look?

5:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  to the forms and make sure that they make sense of that.

5:02 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Brighton wanting a submitting as an employee card and it is not working, we are having submissions with it, but we are fixing it.  So you won't be able to submit form as an employee, but everything else should work. Great.

5:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then we have the e-Site, which I know that Brighton and you have been working on, but that should be done soon too, right?  we are starting it.

5:25 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So right after we release this part, we complete this test and this part is okay. We will start working on the carbon reporting and that e-Site.  Born will probably start even soon because on the backend side, there is some work on carbon reporting calculations, the other than that, we are starting it soon, probably tomorrow, I guess, the latest.

5:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay.

5:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then, yeah, so then we need kind of third party to be ready by Monday, maybe or Monday or Tuesday, right?  Actually, dashboard, what about dashboard? How will we do that?

5:55 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  we have a demand for it or did we agree on something else? Yeah, I was talking with...

6:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I get in terms of like kind of what data sources can we take from these controls and just like make it like it.

6:06 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So it put something to put the dashboard in.

6:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  know what are like some typical ones?

6:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think she's going to look into that.

6:12 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So it would be just taking some statistics and putting it in there.

6:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think in terms of like. Like bigger and so we can work on that in between two then also like so yeah, that's something like if we need more time on third party then to work on the dashboard in between that if I understood correctly, want to release their words right after controls, right?

6:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  yeah, ideally I think yeah, I think so if we can.

6:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So and I just noticed like the control section, like you know that picture should be like changed then. But I guess that will be, you know, we had agreed on that new guy.  But yeah, let me let me know. Let me know once it's ready.

6:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We can just put in this picture.

6:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It should be quick.

6:50 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  yeah, so then this part is ready.

6:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then it goes to third party. Yeah, I was just saying with third party, we actually could we talk with Anya?  And we got her feedback. Talked Linda recently from Hydro, Rain, and also Mari, who are also subject matter experts.

7:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And they're interested in this subject because they know it's difficult.

7:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So also, if we have an initial drawing, we can also go to them and check it before we go start programming it next week or something like that.

7:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But then I just need to get into the calendar.

7:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And we have to have a drawing ready to be able to sit down with them and show them to make sure it makes sense before then.

7:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's to stop our third party.

7:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Same as controls, sorry to interrupt you.

7:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We just, we all know there is already implementation in place in the old way, in the old design. So just to keep that in mind, similar to controls, just that.

7:41 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So we can go through it later or when we have a third party meeting.

7:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, go through it now too, to like so you can see.

7:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think we did kind of go through it when we were kind of redesigning or maybe not, I'm not sure how if you've seen it.

7:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The third party.

7:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sorry, I have to interrupt. Because there's three different loops now that I have questions on.

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So first thing, controls moved really quickly, which is great. The next thing is either third-party or dashboard. It seems to me that we are agreeing that the next thing is third-party, correct?

8:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think dashboard is next, I don't think that you'll have as much to do a dashboard because it's more, what we're missing for dashboard is actually what are we collecting, like what do we want to visualize.

8:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I don't think we need necessarily, I don't know if that's a question, Eva, like once we understand what we want to measure.

8:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So how are the blocks different to do?

8:35 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So first you define your data points and then I would like the designer just to pick the right charts and show how they look in the UI.

8:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would still prefer that because then we know which chart goes left right, which top right and how big is this and how big is that one.

8:49 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  It's important, I would say.

8:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I would prefer that once you have the data points. Until then, you can work on third-party.

8:55 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  course, then come back to that point.

8:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so that's what I was thinking, Brighton and I will work on the data. points for controls and then ideally once we have that, then we can share it with Romeo to put them into charts.

9:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I don't think that will take as long as more the data.

9:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Whereas third party, I think it's more of actually the flow that we need to check that makes sense in the approvals and that, and that's going to take a little bit longer.

9:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Also, Abby, do we want to do the tour stuff?

9:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  remember that pop-up that tells you about controls, policies, do you want to do that somewhere in between what's your opinion on that?

9:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's a front-end task only, but still it's a question.

9:35 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, why are you are gone?

9:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Our investor was really pushy in terms of not having enough feedback guidance for new users who don't know about this subject.  I told our investors, we purposely did that because we wanted to get something out rather than build something from like.  knowing nothing, right? And then the plan is to go back and like give more information. But I know that they have been a little bit, they weren't happy about that.  I have a meeting with them on Monday, but like, so we kind of agree that we can add a little bit more direction onto it, like with pop-ups like you've had before.  But I would say that like, also just to let you know, like, I've been kind of thinking about our platform and like, one is once we get our platform up, but what is the next stage of our platform, right?  The next stage of our platform is going to be integrating more AI into our platform once we once we have this initial part done.  And then I would say, and I've been talking with Brighton who talked with another investor today, because because the regulations are changing within the EU.  Also, Zhao, that's another thing that probably happened when you're on vacation. Yvonne, I'm not sure if you heard too, but the EU had an omnibus regulation that kind of came out, which deregulated a lot of what we're doing.  Like, so like, It took like, in the past, was like small, medium-sized companies need to do this. Now the regulation that's being proposed in the EU is that it's a thousand employees or more.

11:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So they've kind of like cut like how many, you know, so that also impacts our strategy and like what to do.

11:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And so I've been like, so I think we're still trying to figure this out. But when my initial vision when creating Fortify was like creating like an AI co-pilot, ESG co-pilot compliance officer, I think that was even on our website, right?  And then in that process, we changed it to more like a platform just because our customers want just they want it done.  They don't need AI yet, right? But where we're going and where the industry is going, it's like, especially also if we want to have VC funding, we need to have more AI and like actually move towards like, and we actually applied for this.  This is the big ramp that we apply for, which would be like 800,000 euro if we got it, which would be like to almost make it  AI agent for sustainability and compliance so like using our platform but instead of having an internal person managing it AI would be kind of managing it so that's like a much bigger kind of direction so it's um so that's like in the kind of discussions how do we position ourselves kind of for the next wave like you know which is like AI agents and sustainability officers using the work that we've already done because that's the foundation of being able to gather the data that they can you know work on and to be able to digitalize a very manual process but I think it's a long way of saying like I'm not I need to have a talk with the investors about like you know they might be thinking that we want to just only build a platform but I think we need to build even more because as I talk to customers too it seems like a lot of them um they like where we're going had two really good meetings with some pilot potential pilot customers like they were they don't they're not going to hire full-time resources but some of them also just wanted running in the background do you know what I'm saying like they don't they don't even want to like they would like rather just  even have an office manager do it, they would just like it to be moving and just kind of check it, you know, and that's kind of where I think like, if you go on technology wise, that's kind of the next stage, but in the short term, this makes sense of what we're building makes sense and we need to sell this, but there's like, I would say this is just like a middle part of the end goal that we have that that makes sense even so then we need to think about what do we want to build, like how much of like impact makers feedback do we want to build of like somebody getting directions like, you know, like Suzanne getting directions on how to do this versus an AI agent is kind of doing it from behind the scenes and not needing the directions, you know, like it's a segue in between like where we're going, but in the meantime, we still need to get the basic out, this doesn't stop what we're doing now, right?  We still need to do this, but it's just like for you guys to know that this is not the end goal or end goal is something even even more as yeah, that's yep, makes sense.

13:56 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think that's where we are all going with all the apps we'm using and we will use in the future, so yeah, makes sense to me.  I would just then now go back to do maybe near future just to define the priorities again and see what's next.  But basically for controls, I think we have more or less everything. It's not in one place and it's fine, but I think we are fine.  will manage to, we need to work and I think it's fine. The second thing is now dashboards, priority wise and third priority management, that's priority but dashboards are blocked by, not blocked, but waiting on Brighton and Abby to define data points.  And when you define data points, then we can design it. And after that, it's third party. So actually we can start working on third party as soon as possible to define third party stuff and just go back to their words once you have those data points.  I think that sounds like a good plan to me and you'll have enough work to do. One question in between all this.  We mentioned this on boarding stuff for our investors and stuff. I mean, that's not actually that much of a work, but still we will need content for that.  Because to look nice, that requires some pictures, some good descriptions, stuff like that.

15:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's not something we can do ourselves.

15:10 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  for that part, want to put it in somewhere, let me know, but we need to do it with design team together.  That's my point. For me, it's like I'd rather wait on that part until after we've done risk assessment.

15:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But we can have a discussion because I'd rather You can show them the feedback.

15:35 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We added that feedback stuff so you can say, okay, you can now submit, and we are listening to feedback, blah, blah, blah, so that they are aware that you're listening and trying to improve it.

15:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  that's a question. Yeah. Okay.

15:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes.

15:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, great.

15:50 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Question, Joe?

15:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, probably a lot of questions from John. I just came back from vacation and

16:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Oh, no, it's all frozen because of teams. Yeah, I think so.

16:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

16:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think it was.

16:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you want to move to? Oh, no. Yeah. Okay, let's move to Google. All right. Thanks.

16:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello. I hear you. Oh, everything is a strong word. No, I think I've missed quite a bit. Let me just accept everyone.  Just pull everyone in.
