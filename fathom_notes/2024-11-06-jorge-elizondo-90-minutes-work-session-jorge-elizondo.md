0:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  hello my dear friend how are you good I'm good I see that you are using OBS you've been trying to create videos I mean trying to do some things I can't and I also talked with Lucy yesterday she's so amazing she seems very friendly I've never spoken to her but she seems very friendly she's very friendly but yes I think I'm not at the moment at the face she can help me yes she will help me but right now I think we need I need to have the content that she's going to visually explain right so  She's, she's great so far and she gave me some ideas, know, like how many content areas do you want?  And I was thinking, okay, I need one for the community, one for the groups, the cohorts and one for individuals.  And I was thinking while I was talking with her, maybe sometimes my patient, it's really complex, you know, and I want to have this and that.  And she told me, you know, that would be like, it's amazing, but that would be pricey, you know, so I need to put my feet on the ground.  And she told me for each area, it's like 2,000 and I don't see it as bad, but yes, it's expensive.  But I was thinking maybe I need to, to simplify things. I don't need to have this universe where eventually it will become my meta, you know, like people can see everything.  But for now, maybe just a context of this galaxy, people, you know, having in different parts of the galaxy, like a sticky notes of  are the things that you discover in your exploration, right? Like, is there a sensation, emotion, thoughts, beliefs, in what part?  so they can start mapping, you know. And in a way, also, like having this in a personal way, it's a way I can interact with people because sometimes they don't want to talk or they don't want to say things where they can put an image, or they can be sticking out.  And then I can see that maybe I need to dive in, you know, like, where are you in the inner exploration, know?  How profound are you? Because it, you know, I could put the image of the galaxy, like, in different layers of profoundness, you know, like, biographical or more cosmic or more, you know, like, expansive, you know?  So I can see, like, what kind of support I can give. So it's a new methodology to visual technology that came to my mind.  So I just found it interesting. What do you think is your profile? from those four profiles if you were your your customer my profile which one I think the second out yeah okay this is interesting because I was I was doing some stuff with this and when you sent me the first time it felt really really cohesive I thought it was every category made sense but they were distinctive they were not just a piece of the same thing in different ways it was really good I really liked it and then I was doing more work and I liked it even more I think it's a really good framework yes you know that's why I don't know you know like I just need your expert advice at the moment but beyond the framework thinking and everything I like your way of thinking and how you see things so in my I'm  Currently I'm starting to do the branding with an agency and I'm doing like a expensive investment But we really want a big so there's a thing between What I found in the in the psychedelic context is you know like this branding and and of Pachamama Ceremonia Mystica they put there like the more Americans part.  It's the the hats and they're all tattoos and and singing to the carols or to clinical So what I'm trying to do is take off the therapeutic side And you know put it more in the exploration, you know kind of side so more transformative and creating these process facilitations like the ones that aj worship or facilitation a school does, know, like it's more of tangible results and you have seen me listen to it before you know out Orient outcome outcome oriented, but what I'm trying to  A branding is I don't want to also like to lose sight of the people that they want community. So In the end, I don't know if the best team Should be like a space I think It is for me and and I love it.  But What do you think people might perceive or in your tape like you start you are starting to know me and things like that.  Do you see uh, is it something like Uh, the space thing and Is it a good selection or Or not down to earth, you know, because I don't I want to be like kind of the teslau that's psychedelic space, you know I don't want to be Like kajak or a bicycle, you know, so I also I I want to be in the middle between my vision and what the world needs or wants, you know, so I I empathize with that question because I had a lot of questions about my own branding Because  name of my company, which is funny because nobody ever mentions the name of my company.

6:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I spend some time thinking about it. So the name of my company is not descriptive and it is not super helpful for people to understand what I do.

6:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I think I did it for myself because I wanted to have a cool company name.

6:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But maybe if I were like super really focused on business, maybe I would have another name that would be more descriptive, right?

6:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And so this relates to the question you've asked me, is like, okay, João, I really like space, but I'm wondering if space is the right backdrop for everything I'm doing.  And so I didn't think about this before.

6:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm sorry, I can hear myself talk. Is it feedback or something? I think so but I turn out the okay okay thank you so basically okay what I'm thinking is what do you do is a little bit uncommon right a little bit is an euphemism is quite uncommon and maybe people need a thing a box where they put you even if you need to correct them in their perception like oh wait I know you're thinking of me in this way it's not just that is a little bit different but I think people think of categories and places in those categories right if your category was really densely populated let's say you are just another design firm and you need a way to differentiate from from other design firms because I'm thinking is as we speak I didn't think about this before so  If you do a common service, differentiation becomes more important, right? And there you have more space to say, oh, I'm like a design agency, but working with us is like traveling to space, right?  So people, they have already a boxer to put you in, and then you say, but this is different. Given the fact that your company is a little bit different, it's more innovative than that than a design company, maybe taking away the space idea is better.  I didn't think about that before, but maybe holding back a little bit on that aesthetic layer, the last layer, like the symbolic layer, maybe it's good, I don't know, it's a good question.  But my gut feeling is that it's probably best to be less space than too much Space I think too much space some people.  I think we lose some people, but I don't know Maybe maybe you could ask some past clients. What do you think?  It's a good question.

9:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's because at the end it's like kind of An exploration, you know, like choose your path choose your adventure choose your level of support, you know So it's a way in a community.  I'm between, you know, I don't I don't want to be just like a Outreach consulting company, know, like they you know, how they're they they project themselves, you know In the design part and also the way they work and I don't want to be a normal coach And I don't want to be just one that gives you tools.  I want to Put a lot of emphasis in the experience itself that yes, you have elements of community You will have a circle or a school community You will have a coach and everything but that's not the experience experience.  It's about you It's about the user entering new words. So I'm It's about new worlds, new perspective, new ways of thinking, new ways of working, new ways of being, new self, a better me, a better us, a better world.  So in a way, it's maybe not infusing like lots of spacey things, but just kind of like Ireland. don't see lots of flying things.  You just see like a really nice branding of an Ireland, you know, American, United, you know, like that's what I'm going.  But at the end, I want to use prime words that maybe are more symbolic, it's not, I don't know, but yes, it was just a thought, let's don't lose a lot of time on this and let's get back to work if you want.

10:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Give me just a little second, And I also found out about something, you know, something that I want to really do.

10:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I found these, let me find it. The school of psychedelic design. It's an it's it's a new public course I want to send you the link right now and on meet and This course it's from the first Psychedelic design a stamp or university course, you know It was an astound for course about how can we design the future of psychedelics?  you know, so it's meant for policy makers for politicians for people that are entrepreneur or venture People, you know, so I think that kind of class would be nice for me But also that's the kind of classes that I want to do is integrating design thinking when thinking design With you know me run all of those things But also with the experience itself and I see that no one in the space It's going to do something like I want I want to do you know, like everyone is doing, you know, the patch mama team the nonprofit The Tisley  a concert helper helping and maybe there's one of two psychedelic consultancy, there's branding, design psychedelic consultants, but no one like creating an immersive experience you know or something that it's so that's why this is an opportunity for me to create a prototype something that we don't know right how it's going to work but I think it's something that it's it's going to be out there you know and I don't want to to be another one of the same thing I want to do the things different right so that's my dilemma right now I think I'm familiar I really like this idea are you familiar with the concept of the Schesterson's fence fence of Schesterson so if I understand it correctly basically it's like a story so if you're walking

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  through a field like a green field and you find the fence but you don't know why the fence is there it should not take away the fence because somebody went through the work of putting that fence it could be that there's like lions out there it could be that there's sheep inside and you know for there's a reason somebody went through the effort of putting the fence so when we find something that we are not fully we don't fully know we need to be careful with you know taking away things so I think it's I like this this idea especially for also for myself when I try to do things really different from everything else and then I find then I realized that maybe there was a reason for those things to be that way and I just didn't know it but so from what you tell me  I think there's, I think there's like two things that could be useful to think about this. They come to mind at least to me.  So the first one is to think more in terms of a roadmap for your company and like stages like oh at this stage we are focusing on this, at this stage we are focusing on this.  So it becomes easier to say I want to do this, I will do this but not right now. And then this this long-term view of everything you want to achieve for me personally has been helpful to deal with the anxiety of oh my god this is such a great idea I want to work on it right now but there's other things that I need to work on and I'm like ah I want to do this this thing right.  So I think the concept of a roadmap or maybe horizons for your company like the next rise and the next arise and the next one I think could be useful.  And the other one is it's a bit related to this which is starting uncomfortably small the change right? So I mean because we've spoken so much I feel comfortable having this conversation but me personally something that I sometimes struggle with is this this capacity for creating amazing plans and really interesting strategies and I love fascinating systems they're all in my mind right?  And I like doing that I feel competent at doing that it's a little bit like playing with LEGO like oh yeah then I could do this oh yeah and then eventually I'm like okay so now I need to do this thing and this thing is immense it's really big and I'm like oh I cannot do this and then me maybe you don't have  this problem. me, then I feel a little bit incompetent, oh, my, my capacity does not follow my dreams, you know.  So for me, what these two ideas, the roadmap view, of just knowing like, I will do this, but not right now, but maybe in three months.  And the other one is like starting at such a small level, it becomes even kind of uncomfortable, like, oh, this is too small.  But then I can guarantee that that that thing will happen, will get made. I don't know if I'm being too invasive or this is too opinionated on my side, but this is stuff that has helped me personally.

16:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, I think it's, it's clear. And I was thinking also as well as the road mapping over my brand and developing different sections or features of what I want to really create.  yes I think like I'm going to see like how we repose but at the beginning I want to I don't know I want to the fence I get the chest or some fence I was looking at it and yes there's some things that are the limits are there because of something they want to protect something so this kind of lens is for people maybe don't to explore something that they're not ready to see you know but with my expert guys and I already travel beyond the fence right so yeah so I know maybe I don't know everything that's out there because there's so many things we don't know but at least I can take them away from the and I see a lot of people and that's my segment those early adopters that are trying to get out of the therapeutic lens or the so that I want to take off this therapeutic lens and I want to take away how the  part. And I want to take away also the clinical lens and the shamanic lens, because it has not given us results.  with this, I know that these things is going to evolve. And that's why a lot of people are not exploring that part because they don't want to be responsible of the risk of not doing it right.  But I think I have good foundations to make it right so yes, I just need to have not clarifying my way of thinking because I love my way of thinking, but it's more about deciding which road to take because I know I can take.  I'm the kind of guy that I don't have a problem or ideas. have tons of it. Tons, know, if it's a fountain of ideas, the thing is which one I need to decide.  And I was reading A lot of enterprises get lost not because they don't have ideas, but because they don't come into one so Yeah, I already with Jorge listen to my personal brand.  I explored being inside the fence and it worked You know, so right now I don't want to be inside the fence.  I don't want to be Just a replica of the American way of doing things. Mm-hmm. I Want to do my playful way of thinking it's it's my it's Playground right It's a it's a playground and I found a lot of Lot of interested in there's a new Kind of way of thinking about worship that it's play shops psychedelic play shops, you know, so It's also interesting to to have that in mind, you know And that's why I'm putting a lot of things and a lot of emotion into the visual thinking and the visual way of working Because no one is doing it like that everybody  keeps information so I need to do something better you know and I want to to create something that I'm really passionate about and I really want to back you know so if people are buying mine I have courses you know from 2000 so for 3000 and there's just information in mind that I put a lot of experience and emotion in it so it's not more it's not just about my expertise it's about you you want to love coming to my school you know you love coming to my education system but at the end I send out a different education system where I value visual thinking and I value just playing around you know because serendipity it's like installing a serendipity engine but yes yes I think that's enough for now but I know that I love because I don't I have been doing this all by myself you know I don't I don't have anyone creative like like  you to talk, know, like, hey, I have this idea, like, let's get feed by it's it's everything by myself and everything has words of cardboard.  If I have the opportunity, you know, just to get it out and see your thoughts. That's nice. Oh, I love this part of the comment.

21:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, talking about ideas is why we do what we do. I love it.

21:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's like so much you said now that we could explore.

21:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll just recap quickly what we said and then see how we move forward. Do you have the link?

21:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  can send you the link. I have the link.

21:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me try to make sense of this. Okay, so basically, at the core of everything, I think there's a positioning aspect, right?  You do That is not super common, but it's already out there in a way, but you do it in a different way for different people for different reasons with your special touch, right?  And one of the biggest reasons for you to do this thing in this specific way, there's two reasons. One of them, and not specific farther, one of the reasons for you to do things in this way is because you see that it works like you've seen like creativity being locked and how these tools can go so much further than just the clinical or the patchman side.  There's like a third side, which is an interesting angle. The fact that there is a third side, I think that there's something there.  And the other thing is that you are a very, this person, you are a very interested person, you want to know things about the world, you want to make things, you want to, you know, know things  Have interesting conversations meet cool people and do nice things and so The sense that I get from you is that your company is also a vessel a vehicle for you to manifest Stuff and have everything connected with each other like if today you launch a play shop for instance That is focused on I don't know making Inventing a new recipe for instance, I don't know and tomorrow you say no, I'm really fascinated about games So I want to create a play shop to create games and you could do all these different things and they all make sense because they are like a Portrait of your mind right they are coherent Did I get it correctly?  Because I really identify with this and And so there's this thing and the reason why this like the deeper thing like the more we talk the deeper  go, right? But the reason why I started talking was like you wanted to have some frameworks to show people and to communicate about your way of seeing the world and thinking about things, right?  And so the idea behind those frameworks is that they give you ingredients, ammunition, they give you stuff that you can talk about and instead of people needing to speak to you for hours and really, oh my god, there's a lot in Jorge's time that I didn't know.  The idea is that the frameworks will shorten this time and people will like, yeah, five minutes talking to Jorge, I get it.  I understand what he's thinking. And then the conversation accelerates towards the really interesting things, right? this diffuse, creative, new, experimental things that I think you like.  So is this correct? Did I get it? I like to check because sometimes I

25:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  far away.

25:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So based on that, I think there's like two things maybe we could focus on. One is like, okay let's just wrap up the basic frameworks.  We know that they will never be fully finished, you'll have more ideas.

25:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Having ideas is easy for you, that's not the challenge. But having the frameworks allows you to place a flag on the ground and say, hey this is my idea, my content, and you keep talking about it and people associate you with that.

25:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like having a vehicle for my idea, you know. Yes, yes, yes, a vehicle. Yeah, I agree, I agree.  Perfect, and the thing is, I really, really identify with many things you say, so you understand that I'm not judging.  The thing is, if we are in love with the act of building spaceships, they remain on the ground. We need to be in love with the act of sending them into space, right?  Which is a different skill set. So my suggestion is that, okay, let's wrap up the framework thing and even perhaps give it one week, two weeks so you can think about what makes the most sense to you next.  Because I don't want to just, you know, nudge you towards just getting new packages. I don't think that makes sense.  So we wrap up the frameworks and you have like things, assets that you can use and they also will provoke discussion.  Like they will help you think, oh, I could talk about this from this perspective or I can talk about this from this perspective.  And after that, oh, apologies, go ahead.

27:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It came to my idea that something that I really want to love to do, and maybe this is for the profile of the Psychonaut, just by listening to you, that I know the framework will always evolve because when we learn something, we change our way of thinking, we're flexible, we adapt, right?  So maybe it's not about just the psychedelic kind of how do I do it, it's about how to explore different mindsets, know?  So in a way it's choose your destination, choose your path. But I was thinking about the Psychonaut right now because I'm processing it when you ask me which, like with profile you identify with, and the kind of experience that the Psychonaut experience, psychedelic Psychonaut once is not more about healing, I get this a lot, you know, like I don't want to do this anymore about healing, is there a problem?  also like what's next Jorge what's next what's next you know that are the kind of question and it came to my mind now it's expansive experience design you know how do I decide my experience you know because when they say now what's next it's not about asking yourself what's next you know what do you want to explore what do you need to find out to move to your next level you know so how do you design your experience you know so it's like a worship of exploration design you know like what are you trying to explore and for what purpose you know so you can explore the infinity and beyond but you want to bring something tangible to this world so I came to the name of expansive experience design because at the end it's an expansive but I don't know between expansive or exploration design but because at the end it's an intercession also is well in design you know that I love this and that's why we're designing frameworks I want to design illustrations I want to design everything so yes I  just came that to my mind. Just by listening to you sometimes I know that everything's connect at the end but it gave me that idea.

29:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No I think yeah it absolutely connects and it's really I mean it makes sense that curious people want to keep digging further and exploring the depths of of this idea right because let me organize my okay so this thing you just said you've talked about creativity since the first conversations we had so this is not the new thing right but but eventually we started talking more about the balance between science  emotion, Pacha Mama, North American, that kind of thing. And in this past conversation we are having now, this past 15 minutes.  And another thing became more clear to me that wasn't before, which is like, like I said, the third way.

30:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  oh, there's people that do this for healing or for spiritual reasons.

30:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For healing, PTSD, like the clinical, the John Hopkins, there's the Pacha Mama sort of thing.

30:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And there's people that are like, they're comfortable in this world and they want to go there and do creative things and come back, right?

30:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're experienced psychonauts. And that's a very fascinating idea because the more specific you are, you can start to see types of psychonauts, right, which is even more profound.

31:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's different types of psychonauts.

31:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I really like that. think it feels like Alice in the Wonderland. want to jump into that. But I don't want us to jump into that and leave something and finish it before.  I think there's something really powerful there.

31:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes, yes. I love that different levels of psychonauts. And maybe there's a mystic and there's a creative one.  We have sub-personalities also inside every archetype.

31:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's nice.

31:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  yeah. OK, we can start. But I'm going to write that on the mirror because I love that. Sub-personalities in the art.

31:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me share some stuff, my screen. So one of the things I was doing. I tried to create blueprints for the frameworks we have.  And these blueprints are not, they don't have your style. They are just like a very black and white neutral way of communicating the frameworks we've created together.

32:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And if you need to send them to the design agency and make them look really branded, they will understand this thing, right?  So I'll share my screen with you right now.

32:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I've probably seen my screen. And this is the stuff we did, right? I've made very little changes to this.  well, basically just putting it a little bit more clear and is the stuff you've seen. The funnel, I will just go over and then eventually we can dive deeper.

33:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The journey, and the profiles, what's easy, what's difficult for them, a couple of them that I have questions, but we can go into that later.  And this one is very complete, this is the archive, I was just working on it.

33:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, given this, there's no new information in this stuff, right?

33:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This is all stuff that we do together, so you know this stuff.

33:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Given this, my suggestion is we go back here and you did mention that these three things would be the ones that you are most interested about creating frameworks for.  Your specific approach to support.

34:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  like how you do the support thing but right now I think I also would love to explore the why isn't it just sort of therapeutic you know because it's I also would I would prefer the why it isn't just all the one that it's right besides trends to of desired transformation I think those are kind of the same because that's how I'm going to put my frame in it's not just chamanic or clinical you know like we can explore design thinking and we can explore creativity you know like and I have people that are doing creativity times psychedelics and there's people you know they want to say it's correct psychedelics and design and there's actually an award of psychedelic design thing in in London you know so I am you know there's people also yeah already exploring those areas you know but I think this one will be nice as well okay cool so and do you want to start here or can we start here  whatever you know it's it's well we can we can I start in the like this I think okay so sorry for the other thing it was just I am using this platform to get out all my ideas okay so let's explore this thing I'll bring it here and I'll just put a few of these and I'll talk to you and see what can bring what we can extract from this one of the things we know we already have this right I'll change the power so we don't get lost

36:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. What makes it different?

36:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So now I'm starting our dive.

36:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What makes it different, your method from the other methods?

36:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. What's different? Do I need to put it there or do I need to say it? You can say.  Okay. What's different? First, I think it's my narrative or way of saying things, but what's different about my approach?  Also maybe that I'm introducing more of a proactive approach, more of a design thinking way, kind of working. I'm not clinical, I'm not pachamama, I'm not ceremonia, I'm not a spiritual, I don't have any like custom, you know, there's no, I'm not a witch, I'm not a magician, I'm just a human being like you, you know, but I want to have more of this aspect of I created for innovator kind of feeling and maybe that's why it's appealing to a lot of technological entrepreneurs, you know, that they're looking for that so I'm also trying to push this custom of being a decent entrepreneur in a way, you know, so I don't have like a like a white t-shirt or like not also not the corporate guy with the tie and, you know, the suit  I'm I'm not any of that, you know, so my approach So my what's different my branding exactly and let me see my notes because I have my DNA here.  So also I'm Into outcome results, know, at its essence. I want to give people an update and life design, you know So the the main focus, it's not psilocybin It's it's the method the process.  So the my narrative it's pushing, you know, it's the method is the process is the Followable with someone, you know with an expert guidance expert guidance expert guidance.  You need it, you know, like So also I want to I don't want just facilitate an experience facilitating a better decision decision me  You know, like you need to decide, you know, that's why I'm putting the things off The mirror bars or the workshop because at the end if people are coming to psychedelics is because they want to be more creative, you know, but If they're creative, they also need to decide on an idea.  So a lot of people are also like in I want to name this and there's generic kind of Activities all do meditation or take a walk outside or draw, you know Sorry for the world  that, know, like it's it's generic, you know, like That's why people it's are not getting the integration because they think it's you need to you're going to have appeal that it's going to work with anyone.  No, that's why we're doing archetypes because Depending on who you are, you need to work on something and you need to take decisions about your relationships.  You need to take decisions about your organizations you need to take decisions about your health so how do we decide that's where the workshop comes in you know like give me all the ideas that came to mind in the experience you know we don't want to stay in the motion oh for me you know I need to heal you know why that happened to me now I want more a proactive approach you know okay you find out about this so what are the options you have you know you can go to therapy you can acknowledge this and just be in the process and accept it or stay in the healing part so also I'm pushing the mindset thing you know it's it's also developing the mindset developing the character so we're we're pushing results outcomes you know and we help help people land their ideas it's a land of spaceships you know I I help you going outside but I also have you you know get to the base camp you know we need to land you know  the revelations, Eureka, the Ahamamans need to become an impact, you know? So when we talk about transformation, we're also talking about changes and people believe or think in an innocent way that just by having the experience, oh, I change, know, but they get back to life and it's the same because they didn't make changes, you know?  So they need to have experience, but the changes are best done before getting outside, again, in the matrix, you know?  So they need to decide. also my guidance is not just about, it's not about experience. It's just consulting, coaching, and tools.  Or in other ways, with tools, mean integration, with coaching, I mean community, and with consulting, I mean experience, you know?  Experience also, like you having the experience, but also the experience of an expert guided, you know that they will take you and in a way we're pushing for serious seekers to integrate the psychedelic trips into daily life, know.  Also, I think I only got to community experience and I said consulting coaching and tools tools are integration coaching is community and consulting its experience.  So yes, experience, community and integration. And we could say, we could say that also what I'm trying to build with the frameworks, it's, I think it will night, it will be nice to say so we can differentiate more ourselves that we are designing custom made experiences based in the intention or the archetype or the profile.  Now you can choose the destination you know like we can go here or we can go there you choose your adventure or the path that you want to take like if you want to do just kind of a worship and that's it or a pool program and choose the level of support in a way so we we give you the options that you kind of choose you know like in a way that you explore the destinations you explore the routes we take what you choose your adventure in what you want to explore you choose the path and the level of support so we give you we are we are the the guide not the hero it's it's something you told me so yes facilitating outcomes and change okay

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you facility team outcomes and change. Okay And what's Let me let me think about this Why Should we So I see what's different in your way, I Would like to know more of Why this is not enough the soul that you're big and the kind Why move away from that?

44:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, because you're a beauty space it stays in the Emotional part and we are emotional, but we are not only emotional Also, why not why not so?  Because we are spiritual beings having natural resources experience before we are terrestrial experience having an experience but we are not just spiritual beings so moving past emotional healing and moving past just being we are all one you know I think I wrote something like that let me find that as you know the healing thing is you know in a way we are here for a short period of time and in a way we have a role to perform to contribute to this life and in a certain way the purpose it's not about being in unity you know like oh we are all one so that's a spiritual thing you know we are all one and you know too much love but at the end we will encounter that and we  experience that when we're dead, you know? For now, like, what are we doing? You know, like, what are we doing?  So we need the creative part, know, like, what am I creating to the world, you know? So moving to the exploration and creativity in the innovation part, it's how I can make a social impact, you know?  So if we differentiate creativity with innovation, creativity, it's more about having ideas and connect the dots. But innovation, it's about creating something with social impact, you know?  So that's why we need to move from the emotional part because we're going to experience the motion all the time.  It's not going away. We want to move apart from the spiritual kind of way because it's like Buddha, you know?  You are cleaning toilets, you wake up, you keep cleaning toilets, you know? Nothing changes, you know? So then... Let's not get stuck in that, but with the innovation, innovation meets psychedelics is about what kind of social impact I'm creating, you know.  So it's between innovation and design that we can create something beyond because that's the work of designers and design thinking.  Got it.

47:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

47:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I see how everything connects.

47:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what I'm thinking is, so I'll think out loud so you know what I'm thinking. I'm thinking about what's the best visual framework to consolidate this conversation we just had.  And now I will use the kind of thing maybe that's the best for now. I'll bring you to me, and...  Can you give me just one second?

48:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Of course, of course.

48:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

48:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's it, yeah.

48:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so one way we could do this, we do the very familiar van diagram, right?

48:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And we can have three things here, the clinical, the soul or emotional, and the creative. And when you have two of them, I don't know if you're seeing what I'm drawing.

48:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you see what I'm drawing? Yes, sir.

48:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, okay.

48:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when you have, like, creative and emotional, you have... certain thing.

49:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  When you have creative and clinical, you have another thing.

49:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you have emotional and clinical, you have another thing. And when you have all of them, you have Jorge.

49:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So this is a way we could try to fit this stuff.

49:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Another way that is kind of similar is a 2x2.

49:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Consultants love 2x2s. And the trick would be to know what are the axes, right? So let's say personal.

49:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I don't like this word, but let's just say like this. Group, social, mankind. I don't know, something like this, okay?  And here we could have, I don't know, impact.

49:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And here we could

50:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  have, uh, discovery, I don't know.

50:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

50:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, personal with impact, we're talking about innovation, no, sorry, uh, personal with impact, we're talking about life design, because you're changing your own life.

50:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Group, mankind and impact, we're talking about innovation and change. Hmm. I've learned it.

50:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When you talk about discovery and the group, I think we're talking about I think it's kind of, I don't know, maybe sense making, uh, sense making sounds nice.

50:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Meaning something, something like that. Okay.

50:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And when we're talking about personal discovery, well, this is kind of the more typical exploration, let's say, inner work, I don't know.  No, yes, yes, of course.

51:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Whoa, you're getting me. I love it. So we're talking about the same sort of thing, right?

51:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And basically, in these frameworks, what they like about them is that they show you the components, right? And they also allow you to see what happens when you remove a component or when add a component, right?  So they don't say that any of them are bad, which I think is a good thing. So if I don't do, if I'm like, oh, I mean, personal discovery, this graph doesn't say I suck.  It just says, oh, that means you care about those things. If you care more about those other things, maybe you belong here, you know?  So I like this framework for that. And I'm thinking if there's another one we could use, I had I had some reference here.  I've printed some stuff that helps me a lot.

52:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm so grateful of you. Oh, thank you.

52:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is very special to hear. I'm very grateful. I feel it's not always that I feel that I can contribute this much.  yeah, I feel very seen, very appreciated. So thank you for that.

52:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So can we call this map, what would you call the entire map? Because at the end, it's a playground or a discovery map.  how could you call that? Because it also, it can open a lot of things. People having these lands to work, I found it so amazing.  Yeah, we need to give it a name, right?

53:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know yet. I think the best the best okay, let's just don't get lost there.

53:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We can continue that later But yes, I think the name will be nice also, you know as a framework, you know, like what are my lenses, uh-huh I also like the word lens.  That's a good word Because it's like a telescope, you know, and I say people and and there's this a phrase of a standard like growth That it's one of the pioneers in psychedelic therapy, you know, if done correctly correctly The psychedelic tool could be like a telescope for astronomer or like a microscope for a biologist But in a way it's not a telescope neither a microscope because it's not a lens, you know It amplifies things but at the end where am I where do I look, you know, what's the that I want to look at, you know Perfect.

53:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's a great point because It's not, it's a famous phrase, you've heard it. If you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right?  And one of the things that makes people see that you are an expert is the fact that you know which tool to use for each specific circumstance.  So this, the way of thinking about frameworks is to think like, what problem are we trying to solve where this framework helps us, right?  So we don't, we don't necessarily think about what's inside the framework. We think about why do we use the framework or where is the framework useful, right?  So when we're trying to answer this question, why is it just so simple or therapeutic and kind? The moment that we assume that people have this question,  is when they are getting to know your company, right, and you. And at some point, this is more like, if you think about the sales cycle, this is the framework that is more for like a consideration stage, right?  People begin by being, maybe you know this problem unaware. Are you familiar with this?

55:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, like they are aware of the problem, but not a solution. Then they're. Yeah.

55:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's the thing. So I think this framework, it fits when they already know of different solutions.

55:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. And comparing solutions.

55:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right. Yes.

55:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have, you know, that's for like innovators and early adopters in a way because they have already like experience.  They recreate. There's another like kind of way to do it. It's, I call it. a creative what people don't do like with that with a framework they just like experience that in a concert or a festival or with themselves or at home but they don't have like a protocol like that's what i want to take away from like the protocol kind of things from the clinical part and put it into more kind of like a method for the creative part you know okay okay that's that's very powerful yeah a bit because they're lacking in the creative like lots of people that don't have recreated the recreational space they don't have a framework they just do like let's see what pops up so that's why it's it's also like really hard for them to land ideas in the therapeutic it's like they kind of acknowledge things and they work towards that with somebody you know and in the soul searching thing or the more it's more about you know like i found myself you know but then what you know you found yourself and then what you know so they're lacking like  All it's soul and creative are lacking a structure. Clinical is too a structure, but it's like it doesn't have like the allowance for them to explore more.  It's just what the therapist thinks it's best, you know, like the trauma. You know, like they don't decide what to work.  They give you the it's it's a trauma. So I think this this could be nice to expand that framework, you know, people like we're taking away the structure from the clinical and we're putting it in the in the playground for creative.  We're creating a playground for you in a way.

57:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, okay, okay, okay. So we have the clinical and the clinical has a bunch of elements to it. Right.  Yes. And we have the creative, and the creative is nuts, right? So the creative is water, and the clinical is the glass.

58:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And the chamanic or a soul, it's air. It's everywhere. Everywhere. You know, if we put it like into element.  Okay. Vessel. Well, what's fire? Come again. don't understand.

58:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's fire?

58:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  know, if we were putting the element, what should be fire? Oh, okay. We don't need it.

58:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is liquid. And this is gas.

59:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  or it could be like the emotional it's liquid and the creative it's fire or what do you think because also fire is open you know and can burn everything you know it transforms everything but if it's not in a structure in a vessel like you know like in the cooking machine you know if they start the fire it will burn my house you know come again so you said the emotional is water and what is fire create the creative because it what's it it is the one that transform you know if I can do a barbecue in a container you know the fire it's going to work for that container for do my steak but if I turn on the fire in my house it can burn out my house you know it can destroy my house because I don't have a structure to where to put it you know so the fire you put it in the right place I don't know what  think about that.

1:00:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's interesting. I'll just keep saying I'll save it here and I'll get back to it. Perfect. I think that's very useful.  So what the clinical does is to give structure, right? And it's like it's a little bit like I go to visit you in your house.  This is me and this is you. And you have a beard. And you tell me, hey, do you want some tea?  And I said, yes, I want some tea. And he said, oh, I have these different glasses. Which one do you prefer for your tea?  And I said, oh, I want that one, right? So now there's many ways I could have that tea. But I've asked you for this for this thing.  And now the tea As this shape right if I don't tell you that I need a glass for my tea Will you just 14 my mouth I mean that's gonna be painful right So I need I need a I need a vessel to Well, but that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking about the Bruce Lee right be like water so the clinical is the what is the vessel the creative The creative is what you put in the vessel and the shamanic What is the shamanic I think shamanic is the thirst So  Let's play with this idea, OK? So we have three things, OK? We have clinical, we have creative, and we have shamanic, OK?  If we have the clinical and the creative, but we don't have the shamanic, like, none of the shamanic, the person lacks.  Let's do it the other way, apologies. Let's do it the other different way. So if somebody has everything, they have a desire to look for this that comes from the shamanic side, we are assuming.  They have a creative desire to explore things, too. They have a creative potency. They have an engine in their mind that can create new things.  And they have the structure that you give them, right? So this is good. This is like your method, right?  Now let's say that they have the creative and they have the shamanic, but they don't have the clinical. Probably they will not have much structure.  They will enjoy the ride, but it will have trouble integrating this thing after the experience, right? Okay. Now let's say that they have the clinical, they have the shamanic, but they don't have the creative.  It's just inner work. It's just inside.

1:03:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's not towards the outside world. Does this make sense? Because this is a way of testing if our framework.

1:03:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I also like it.

1:03:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, I like it. So this could this could be added to the main in one you know the map you know like how not to get lost in the experience you know like or how not to get lost in the integration you know because we need this so they can identify that to have a rather like you know like where am I you know at the moment in my integration process you know I'm staying you know in the in the passive way of contemplating the experience without changing maybe I'm in the emotional side you know I need a different approach you know so this could help them identify you know in what part of the what phase of the process are they so the shamanic is the thirst I'm not saying it is let's just experiment with this let's we are using a pencil not a pen the shamanic is the thirst the creative is what hits the water for the E right

1:05:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the clinical is how we take that water because this goes here and this goes here, right? Let's stress test the framework again.  So if I have everything, I feel thirst and I can take the thing. If I don't have the clinical, if I have the creative, but I don't have the shamanic, I don't even feel thirst.  I can make a tea, but I don't want to drink it, right? If I have the creative, if I have the shamanic, but I don't have the vessel, I cannot drink it.  There's no way of getting the structure. If I have the clinical, if I have the shamanic, but I don't have the clinical.  It is the tea is cold. I mean I cannot make the tea, right? So I need the three things Yes What what are you thinking about?

1:06:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  First that I I I think how this is evolving because this will give lots of clarity to why come to my to my expertise, you know, because I have explored these different paths and I'm having this overview picture about how this could be working.  It's a good idea but working with kind of the elements so that people can identify what what are the important aspects in each word  pros and cons you know like maybe you don't like to clinical but you don't have this kind of You know like you're stuck you know in in in the motions or maybe during the chamanic you're stuck in the spiritual side or maybe you are too creative but you lack a structure you know so that that will give the importance of why am I combining all of them and you know and But this is I feel this is a framework for advanced people and I like Give give me just a second.

1:07:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think somebody knocked on my door. Sorry for interrupting Thank you Apologies, so yeah, so this is a framework for advanced people.  Also maybe it could be interesting the aspect that we told the same story in like three different ways, right?  Because this image, let me just change the color of my pen. So this image, the red one, this image and this image, they are the same thing.  But they tell the same story from different angles, different angles, exactly. So this angle, this angle here, the Venn diagram, is perhaps a more square, let's say, angle.

1:09:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  more rational this angle is a bit more narrative and this one is a bit more exploratory like what would happen when something is not present yeah I think also it's more you of our kind of a roadmap or map or like people can kind of have the the navigational map you know yeah because they can see it progresses right oh we start with just one ingredient and it's not enough then we add more ingredients and it becomes better yeah that's that's true nine we're solving a one over the pain you know people don't know like why I don't know what I do next because they're lacking a structure is  same with life you know you don't have a routine you don't have you don't wake up early and do what you need to do for your you know it's important of habits and routine you know and and that's why the scientific approach it's it's beautiful because it's essence it's helping you to develop this discipline and that's what it's lacking from the other one and also to be creative you need a structure you know like to limit the boundaries of what you need to focus on so you don't get lost in the overwhelming kind of oh you know but yes I think this is a good a good first part so we can continue to evolve in this framework or I'm just excited because I'm seeing doing myself a webinar with these frameworks and people know that I want to be Jorge's program I recently had I'm enjoying this as well I recently watched the video I will make a note to send it to you but if I don't send it to you please

1:11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  feel very free to remind me because the video is about a guy talking about his framework. It's really interesting to pay attention to how he does it.

1:11:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The framework is good enough. It's like a LinkedIn content framework.

1:11:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the way he presents the framework is very smart. So that's an interesting thing to tell you.

1:11:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:11:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we now have an explanation for this thing, right?

1:11:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We have three explanations for this thing. And now let's go to the next one.

1:11:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's keep moving. Which one do you prefer now? Approach to support?

1:11:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Now let's do how to finish the experience. Okay.

1:12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  how to finish the experience. Let me bring this here.

1:12:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't quite...

1:12:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, how do you finish the experience?

1:12:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's a good question. Well, this is something that I'm also missing out. So, I think it's good to put some attention in here.  But I think I need to do like... because as it's right now, I just... you know, when they... when I know they're laughing because some of them, they want to wake up earlier and they want to take off their sunglasses.  is, you know, they want to do whatever they want, even though I say instructions that please do not take your eyesheds, please wait until I tell you to, you know, but it's like a school, people do whatever they want at the end, you know, they don't listen to the teacher, but I finish the experience of, do you mean just the actual psychedelic experience or the experience of the program?  For the context that we're dealing with right now, it's exploration, right? Exploration, yeah. Okay, so first I turn off the music and I tell them slowly, wherever you feel ready, you can slowly take off your eyesheds and when you feel ready, you can start opening your eyes, please do it slowly, don't try to stand up.  fast, know, like some, some recommendations, you know, how to approach. And if you are still in the process, you can stay in the, in your space for a bit.  If you need support, please raise your hand and I will approach you. And I recommend to start touching your body with your hands, like a somatic integration, you know, like touch your body and come back to this moment, come back to this present, to kind of a bread work exercise, you know, like let's breathe three times and come back to this moment, come back to this present.  And I just leave them for 10, 15 minutes, some are waking up, some are still laying down. And I tell them, you know, right now I want to give you some space, can take a walk, you can take your time, or you can talk to me if you want.  But after 25 minutes, we were going to do a integration circle I want to listen to you I want to listen to how are you feeling what did you discover what do you find interesting what didn't you like about the experience and yeah so it's more about the talking kind of integration circle what that's when it's a group when it's individual it's just right away you know like if they have the glasses you know while you're in the experience I'm going to start asking some questions you know and slowly when you feel like better I can take off you can take off the glasses what as well before doing that I remember that I if it's individual just individual I as a participant how are you feeling right now are you do you feel you're in like are you feel you feel like you're landing yes I think I'm landing you know I think the the experience it's over perfect you know when you're ready you can take off your eyeshades and I will ask  One question just to see how are you how you feeling? So I have like a verification list of questions, you know, like, how are you feeling at the moment?  do you do you see blurry or do you see? Okay, you know, your sensitivity, you know, like how do sensations fill in your body?  How emotional are you feeling? you feeling, you know, is there something that came up that it's been hard on you that it was painful?  You know, just to check on the emotional side, you know, what are the recruiting teams, know, the learnings, the wisdom that you recollect from this?  What is the pain that you encountered? know, so it's questions about what they discover in a way. And so it's two parts verification questions about how are they feeling?  You know, like, they know I care about them genuinely. And the other side, it's about what did you find out?  You know, I want I want the the treasure, you know, I'm gonna I'll write it down for you so we can explore it later.  But I need the treasure right away, you know, so it's there. And then, you know, if I go to someone who has to do the experience, we talk for one hour, I make sure he's okay.  I make sure he has water. I make sure he feels supported. And I tell him, you know, it's time for me to go.  But if you need any questions, if you need anything, if you have doubts, if you have questions, if emotional things come up, please, you are, it's okay to text me.  You can contact me through WhatsApp or email, and I'll be just monitoring if you need anything from me. I'm also going to send you a PDF of recommendations.  But I think now that's my assist. But I think it's better to send the recommendations of integration before and in a video, because they don't want to read right away.  They won't read it right away, you know. They need to rest for at least 12 more hours. So, for me, just remember that you need to rest.  You need to drink a lot of water. You need someone here to support you. It could be your wife.  It could be a friend. But remember, you need a space. Don't go out. Don't go to places with a lot of stimulus.  And please take care of yourself. Right now, it's important that you give a space to you. And we will see tomorrow for one hour so we can explore more the integration.  That's the follow-up. So, the landing is more about making sure he lands correctly. There's no confusion. He feels okay.  He feels reassurance that he feels supported and that he has access to ask for help. for me, also just make sure that he's in a good state of mind.

1:19:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Based on what you told me, there's two approaches, right? One approach is more obvious, which is just kind of a timeline.  But honestly, I think that's something you don't need me to help a bit.

1:19:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You have this more clear. And what I'm interested in right now is I'm trying to figure out

1:20:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  why you do things this way, right? And I think it seems to me that it's this four or five things.

1:20:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So what you tell me is like it feels that it's about reassurance so making them feel safe. The value of the experience, you've used the word treasure, which is a very good word for that.  So they just went somewhere and they came back with something.

1:20:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They went to something new, you know, like they need to share it in a way, you know. Yeah. Mm hmm.  Uh, oh, there's also the group thing group, uh, okay. And the reassurance is making them feel safe, making them feel, uh, protected.  They feel they, they are very vulnerable, you know, it's, they're vulnerable.

1:21:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So they need a container. So the restraints is, you know, like they know they're supported just so far. Do you hear me, do you hear me right?  Okay. Right? No. Do you hear me clearly? No. I hear you. Correct.

1:21:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. It's just that my pen, uh, got weird, but yeah, yeah, I heard, I heard you right. So we are caring about the person, uh, the support and the help for me.  This is very much. The support and the help.

1:21:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's like an extended laser, you know, like it's, it's. It's like, you know, like technical support in a way, you know, like if you are in a website or something, you have the actual support, you know, like the one-on-one and then the external support, know, like different layers of the container, you know, like...

1:22:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh-huh. But there's also resources?

1:22:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You know, like, because of support, it's also like, yeah, like the control center, control center and also like the resources, you know, like the central hub.  Yeah. You're going to find that in the central location in a way.

1:22:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, like a package that you're sending for them.

1:22:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, it's amazing.

1:22:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, support, come again? No, like Call of Duty.

1:22:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You're going ask for help in assistance, please. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:22:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly. So, and there's... Also like other kinds of support, like a structure that a person can hold and feel safe, right?  So, okay, support and help, respect for the individual experience, I think this is clear from what you tell me.  why do you do you agree with this statement? you agree that it's part of your method to have respect for the individual experience?

1:23:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, because every individual it's like empathy, you know, like I'm not going to interpret anything at the moment, I'm just going to validate.  So it's also I think that comes in the insurance and making them feel, know, the respect part of the process, you know, like they need to  also like teaching them in a way in this space how to respect themselves you know how to respect their experience you know so I find it it's it's also respect about us you know we're not having a problem of trust we're having a problem of respect we respect their trust you know okay okay I'm bringing this here and I am bringing this here and I'll explain why uh group so what and the and the group it's about social efficacy you know there's in the integration it's not about you only it's about having the space to share with others because when you share with others you're in a container of appreciation you know like people  Are not just going to validate your experience, but they're going to appreciate it because if you talk about oh I have this journey and I got to your friends is like what the what the  are you talking about?  know, so the community is important in this space, you know, like Okay, it's for people that are Doing they want to integrate the psychedelic journeys in life.  So they cannot speak to anyone I have lots of clients that they they don't even Tell their parents or their friends that they're going to do this experience because There's a stigma, you know around So it's so that they don't feel Alone, you know in in in what they explain, you know, like is it only me or did you Saw that, you know, so it's it's in the community.

1:25:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so important Okay, so what I'm thinking is that you can already understand the image that I have here  is the pillars of your method, right? This is a possible visual metaphor for it. But let's try to see if we have other methods for us.  So what I like about the pillars is that they are all important.

1:26:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's no hierarchy, OK? That's what I like about them. When I look at his list, I see the stuff above, a lot about respect and acceptance.

1:26:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the one below, I feel that's a lot about efficacy. OK. So, OK, let's make a quick draft.

1:26:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So one possible framework is the visual pillars, okay.

1:27:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Another possible framework is, what do I call this? It's also another way of looking at the pillars, which is the pillar of risk.  Come again.

1:27:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's because I'm looking at the meat, not the mirror.

1:27:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so respect and efficacy.

1:27:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And there's also another way of doing, it's the same kind of framework.

1:27:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Another possible way of doing this, let me think, let me check out my cheat sheet.

1:27:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh, one thing that we can always use and it's very easy is to use puzzle pieces, right?

1:28:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  because it shows that every piece is necessary yes so you don't miss a piece you know you need to have all the pieces yes but I like that and it's also look like playful yeah true true that is that is true and what else can we do with this there's also another way we could do it but I think it's not it will get complex too fast which is we have all the different ingredients okay and you join them together and this is about respect this is about efficacy and this together it's your method  But I think this image, sort of image scope, we would have stuff inside here. I think this image is too complex.

1:29:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The return on investment is not useful. So yeah, the one that I like the most is the puzzle pieces, because it's very easy to understand this.

1:29:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's very easy to translate this into this, right? It's virtually ready already. So like this, like this, like this, like this.  Okay. Cool. That's another framework. Let's see if we can put the third one.

1:30:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How are we for time?

1:30:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We still have time The third one Actually, we did it we did the other way around Sorry, I got excited here so now your approach to support which is interesting because your approach to support is Your approach to support related to what We are basically Unpacking this I think you've kind of answered is already but let's let's go back What are the things the specific things you can do to support and help You

1:31:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Presence, it's one, psychological safety, empathy, expert guidance.

1:31:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you compare expert guidance to non-expert guidance like amateur guidance? What is different about being an expert guide for guidance?  Oh, nice question.

1:31:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Expert guidance integrates different intervention protocols. They know different, they have therapeutic abilities. Different protocols and intervention techniques. Also, expert guidance is about therapeutic abilities.  you know, like that's what we get out of the clinical side, the therapeutic abilities. Also trained therapeutic abuse, because some people they think they're yes, yes, there are lots of people think they're doing therapy and they don't know what they're doing, you know, yeah.  Also certain like in a way train or certify or certify, you know, that gives a contact that it's expert guidance, you know, support and help.  Like also like experiment like experience journey, know, like they've done lots of fight quite a quite lots of journeys by in themselves and they also are a continuous example of getting  their work done, know, their, their, I don't know how to say it, but you can see like, it's like someone that what he does, he also gets help to, it's like therapy that also has a therapist, you know, the coach also has a coach, you know, like he also invests his flight hours.  Yes, it's one. And he also invests in getting better, you know, like a continuous education. So I'll just, I'll put here continuous education by what he said is different.  So I don't want to miss it.

1:33:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's commitment to own work, on work, perfect.

1:33:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you make a smaller diamond so I can see also a presence, psychological or you can save the somebody let me see let me turn up some something more i i'm thinking about the therapeutic way ethics or integrity you know like ethical ethical integrity integrity i think uh the capacity and listening it's an empathy understanding of the process i think comes with the expert guidance like the full understanding of the process uh flexibility you know like they need to be flexible and well that comes expert guidance  you know like that comes with the respect of the and also the professional boundaries or ethical like ethical boundaries that they know like they also the respect you know and so self-care you know like could be but I don't know and openness you know because at the end we can only support you we are also open to the what comes out you know and and and we as the the journeyer that he also be open and also we are curious you know we want to to know more so we are supported also like pushing the boundaries you know like where does that come from like what do you see like what do you smell like how does it  in july what is this teaching you you know so curiosity mindset also he in therapy week we have something called transference and contra transference that is the projection of others you know how to handle that you know also comes with the expert guidance i want to know more about that please explain you know like so in the experience one might say that i do did something to me and i'm here to help you let can you explain more about it and you know like maybe he's working through  abuse and he's projecting that i'm the abuser you know in a way so that's transference and contra transference it could be you know responding to that you know no i didn't do it you know i'm not responding i'm pressing and just at least  Giving you space. I know you're projecting. So it's expert also guidance.

1:37:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  know, like, you know how to handle those situations From my inform also comes in expert guidance Okay, so let tell you what I'm thinking You're the way to do support and help Costs you something is an investment So what I'm thinking is that What are the things that you do that that help you guarantee this level of care, okay, so Okay, let me not Is this clear or do you want more more detail?

1:37:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think we're going somewhere here because also I need to illustrate people the importance of expert guidance you know you know we we want to tell them you know because everyone asks me also as well is uh what do I need an expert guidance if I can buy mushroom for five dollars why do I need it what do I have to do it with you you know like you know it's it's it's not about not only about saying that I have invested myself but you know it's not about showing my certifications you know it's you know like how can I respond to all those questions that they might ask in a webinar you know through these frameworks but also you know like how can we show you know the importance of support you know and and kind of uh in in stealing fear of of the risk of not having an expert guidance you know because you can build a business by yourself but imagine that you have someone that already has a dozens of businesses  successful businesses you know you you you want to save time you want to save bad trips you know you don't want to have bad trips you know yeah this makes a lot of sense okay so what one of the possible directions that I can see is this the other one is to ensure your safety your safety right so they are similar but they are not the same thing which one do you explore first you know if we're doing  the new brand, I want to put it like how my experts, like the experts of my community of my brand, those things, you know, so I don't know, I don't know if Jorge I like it because it's really personal and intimate, know, like they can get close to me in a way like how I do things, but the other one also like it explains like how my methodology supports you in every part of the process, you know.  Okay, no, but perfect. And I think I understand your point, but let's just assume then that this is not Jorge.  Okay. brand.

1:40:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The identity factor.

1:40:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, TIFF.

1:40:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so because do you see the difference between these two different questions? Mm-hmm. The first one, this one here, is more related to, is more static.  It's a bit like a checklist, you know? Like, oh, experts will have training and experts will do their own work and experts will, you know, combine different methodologies and approaches.

1:41:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This is valid, this is valuable, of course.

1:41:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it kind of looks like a checklist, which is not a problem, but it's just how it looks.

1:41:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This second one has a bit more causality, right? So what do I mean with this?

1:41:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like, because Jorge wants to be sure that you feel respected, one of the things that Jorge does is that his qualification form he asks you about, I'm just inventing another, I'm centric.

1:41:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So basically the structure of this is, because,

1:42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, once this, it does this. It's very action-oriented. And conveys the effort that you put into this, right?

1:42:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because it's very easy for people to say, oh, my method is really good. Why is your method good? Oh, my method is good because it's very comprehensive.

1:42:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. What do you do to guarantee that your method is comprehensive?

1:42:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And then the person doesn't have an answer.

1:42:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you realize, oh, you're just saying something. But if you do things for specific reasons and you talk about that, then people can see, oh, there's a reason behind this.

1:42:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This is not just, you know, I guess.

1:42:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first one is more like a checklist.

1:42:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And the second one is a bit more causality.

1:42:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  don't know.

1:42:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know exactly how it looks like, but it's a mix of these things. matter for you to make more impact.

1:43:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the second one is more difficult for us to make, but it makes more important.

1:43:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How can we make it easier for us to make so we can make the more No, let's try to make it.

1:43:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We just follow the same process that we have been so far, like experimenting, doodling. So let me ask, what do you do specifically, like in, okay, so what do you do specifically for actionable advice?  Okay, I start this one. have an idea. You provide a document or a video with do's and don'ts.

1:44:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  this is true right you do this yes okay so this is just this is you walking the talk right oh I give you advice I can show you because I actually if the person doesn't do this there's there's nothing so when it comes to respect and humility what kind of specific things do you do to ensure respect and humility your commitment not judgmental not like not not not judging experience how do you how did you learn how to be were you always non-judgmental is something that is easy for you or you need needed to learn that I need I needed to learn how did you learn it  with Buddhism, I studied Buddhism and it's about compassion and it's about training the mind to not judge anything because the mind, the monkey mind, it always going to judge things.  So it's through mind training, you know.

1:45:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's Yeah, we say the same in Portuguese.

1:45:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, non-attachment, you know, like you cannot attach to your touch, you know. So I'm this person that it doesn't have like the critic part, know, like, oh wait, don't you do these?  you know, I don't have it turned on, you know. So it's off. So it's about shutting down the critical mind.

1:46:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. This is good. My pen sometimes gets a bit confused. Showing down. Critical lines. Psychological safety is one of those words or expressions that everybody likes to throw around, but I think a lot of people don't know what it means exactly.

1:46:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But I think you know because you're trained in this.

1:46:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What kind of things do you do to guarantee psychological safety and openness?

1:46:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe how I talk about vulnerability, that it's the key to really get into the insights of ourselves. you know and I share some of the insights that I encounter with other patients or other clients and how I also encounter different treasures when I let myself be more vulnerable maybe I'm sharing some difficult emotional things and how I went through them so they can identify you know that okay if Jorge does that maybe it's for me time to or also open up you know and and just sharing that I'm like with the restaurants that I'm here for you you know like remember just this is your safe space this is where you can open yourself we're going here to support you so lots of you know hypnotic messaging you know like and psychological safety also explaining you know the different phases of the experience the different types of experience all the facts that they might feel or  Encounters so that gives them safety, you know, okay? Jorge knows what he's talking about and he's if he's telling that I'm going to feel this And I'm going to be okay.  I trust him. You know, like he's the next one, you know And they they view me as an authority, you know, like he they they cross in my guidance, you know Okay Can you tell me specific things you do around ethical and professional integrity?  In the context of support and help, okay Maintaining a professional narrative, you know, not saying anything about me or my life It's I'm here to support you and listen to you, you know, like right now my priority It's what you really need for me and how can I  review the best way possible, you know. So the ethical also, it's the professional. This is kind of not like a friendship.  I'm here to support you. And also, I know the limits, know, in this space it's really difficult. There's shamans and people that because people are very vulnerable, they take advantage of that, you know, or do things or say things.  In a very suggestible space, know, and whatever you say, it's going to impact, you know. But what I hear a lot about people from my questionnaires that I send is, you know, like, I love you.  I love for you to maintain the professionalism, you know, like, kind of, it's not the same like, hey, what's up, what are you doing?  Hello, please let me know if you need something from me, know, so that kind of professional integrity and how I approach them,  I would say the same. It doesn't escape for me to say, oye, que onda? hey, what's up, buddy? know, like, they're not going to listen to me say that.  And yes, I know, I give them lots of space and I don't go to them if they feel the need to come to me.  So I'm not also, I also know, you know, I'm not, I'm narcissistic. I'm the powerful one, you know, I'm just a guy and this is for you.  So I know my place and my role, and you know your place and your role. So I'm not the savior.  I'm Jesus. I'm just here to teach you what I learned from, like, from my own experiences and from my certifications and, you know, like, from my own journey into myself.  Cool.

1:50:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is okay.

1:50:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I have a lot of ingredients here to make a fantastic soup.

1:50:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And, great for, thank you.

1:50:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The curiosity reminds me, it's about, you know, uh being curious you know like it's kind of not not the same but kind of the same as not judging it's about expanding my uh exploration you know it's something that comes up explored and why is it that it's that I'm interpreting I'm making an interpretation of it that way you know like it's also about it's is about expansion it's about as shumini you know a sec acceptance you think radical acceptance maybe yes yes yes yes okay so now what we have is it's so funny because I'm working I'm talking to you on the computer and I'm drawing on the iPad and sometimes I forget and I think of the mouse but the mouse is not on the iPad so  Yeah, yeah, yeah, take your time. Okay.

1:52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I will explain what I'm thinking and maybe in our conversation more stuff comes up.

1:52:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Basically, what you think is still this.

1:53:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The it's important to, and then we say a couple of things, right? I do this thing, right? So, because it's important to me that you feel accepted, I have practiced non-judgmental meditation for 15 years.  Because it's important to me that you feel treated with ethics and professional integrity, wait for people, I don't invade people's spaces and I don't introduce myself as a savior, as a bono, or as a special person.

1:53:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because it's important to me that you feel Safety, I will share some of my own story so you can relate and see what I mean, you know, it's making the connection cause and effect.

1:54:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now what I'm talking about, what can we do like visually to keep this keep this more interesting. So I'll just make some drawings to see if something comes to mind.  you Okay. Okay. Do you have any ideas you want to share with me? No.

1:56:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I'm good so far.

1:56:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I'm not super satisfied with this one. think it works, but it's not very distinctive. For you, know, like for people to associate the CVs and to think about your, your work.

1:57:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I'd like to have more time to think about this one. Okay.

1:57:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But, yeah. So, how are we for, for time? We are right. Yeah.

1:57:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, okay.

1:57:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's check out what happened today through a recap. If created new, so I've shown you some of the frameworks in a little bit more clean design easier to share and to get people to do full force design on them.  I shared some of them with you. The boat still needs work. Where's the boat?

1:57:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  one. The boat still needs work.

1:58:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Sorry, I'm doing it on the zoom out in the iPad. Okay. And, okay, so we did that.

1:58:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We did more frameworks for more stuff.

1:58:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what we have now is how many of them? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten.

1:58:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, sorry, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1:58:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have basically twelve frameworks in different stages of detail.

1:58:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I need to ask, I need to ask, is this what you were expecting from our session? Yes, this is what I was expecting.  Great, great. rate my information in framework so I can teach them more efficiently. This is I feel I'm very happy we got to do this together.  Cool so I mean for our sessions this is it and I will for this meeting here and I will make more I put all of them in this format okay so it's easier to share with others I mean you could put this on LinkedIn and stuff but I don't think it's the best because you're doing your rebranding but at least you can show this to other people and get like different designs on it yes and I'll do I'll put all of them in this style this way of doing this perfect I love it yeah perfect what do you think this is going to be ready like  12.

2:00:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you give me a week?

  No, I'm happy and I'm really excited to keep working with you. Maybe for now it's just waiting on the frameworks and starting implementing them.  Let's see how it goes. But if you also have something in mind through what I've been sharing with you, and how can we develop something maybe, I don't know, when you send me the payment link and as well, I would love for you to share some suggestions in how can we further work together.  you know, is it could be like a workshop design experience or just something that comes to mind through your expertise and what you've seen from me that I want to create, like what's the best next step to work together.  Also, if you still want to work with me. No, I want to. This was fun. I will do that of different formats that make the most sense.  for you and I mean we have an open channel if it makes sense to you fine if it doesn't no harm done it's good and I will send you some references and whenever I find things that oh working needs to know about this I will send it to you oh lovely and I have just one last idea I will I'm going to write that just in case but I'll wait for that but I let me see new ideas to work together but I was thinking as well you know I was playing while you were drawing about the archetypes you say that the different kind of aspect and I came to work with the Chagipiti and he told me like so personalities of each archetype you know and it's interesting how in the Psychonaut we have the mystic the creative visionary you know the ones that create new things the bliss seeker the ones that just wants to be connected to unity the  The ones to the one that wants to heal the war, you know I want to heal everyone and the growth oriented entrepreneur and we having the other kind of the in the healing seeker We have the trauma alchemist the inner child the self-care devotee the forgiveness seeker and the wholeness integrator And in the purpose story we have the values aligner the mission acting like what what do we do next the heart center?  Ideally, you know like how can we create something valuable to war and the visionary dreamer, you know Maybe I need to work with the with the names, but it came with some great ideas and the born-of-war we have that the stress survivor the ones that want to Survive a stress, you know and use a psychotallic to decompress since the self the balance seeker the boundaries builder He wants to put Boundaries in time and energy and how to say no the soul recharger.  He wants to recharge his soul. Maybe he doesn't want to to explore more or he just wants to recharge his soul, you know, with joy, creativity, and passion.  in the cyclone, the ones that they told you, but also we can explore names like the consciousness explorer or the knowledge seeker, non-cognitive scientists, the cosmic adventurer.  So it's going to be nice how I decide which one, it's going to be like kind of a video game, you know, but I'm super excited about this, you know, like while I'm creating tangible results with you, I'm still bridging with this framework a way of integrating more, know, but I now with the framework, I don't get lost in all the things that I could do, but you know, like I'm creating through the limitations of the frameworks that I've done with you so we can choose better, you know, like what's the next steps of the universe.  Yeah, now this is good.
