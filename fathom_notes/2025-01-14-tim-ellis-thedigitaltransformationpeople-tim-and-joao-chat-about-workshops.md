0:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Hello, Joey, how are you?

0:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you? Yeah, very well.

0:04 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Thank you. How are you?

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes, you You you had the first Christmas with a granddaughter or grandson, right?

0:16 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, and no, I actually ended up on Christmas Day. I went down with some fluey bug So so I actually couldn't see I could only see her through the window of my daughter's house So anyway, yeah, no, it was fine.  I had sort of a cake everybody here's got sort of fluey Same same the whole family got it as well.

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we just missed Christmas, but I got it like Right after and my wife got it right after so yeah, yeah, so and it wasn't to be fair It wasn't actually that bad.

0:47 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I mean it wasn't a lot ended up with a cough everything I wasn't particularly ill. was I was still able to eat and drink and stuff It's just I didn't want to give it to my daughter or her child So anyway, other than that, was it was all good  Are you are you soon in Porto or have gone back to Brazil? I'm in Porto.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll be here for Three weeks more and then I go back to Brazil two weeks three weeks three three three weeks.  Okay. Nice Yeah Well the time flew I was checking out the last time we spoke This time of the year.  I think it's really busy with you know family stuff.

1:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So time really flew Yeah, I suppose it has done because we actually spoke in November and it felt sooner it felt like we've spoken more recently so Anyway, and you sent me through some of the that you were writing about which You maybe you sent me through some of the articles that you're writing I think so.

1:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm looking for the fatum notes if you have them there It's post drops for Tim sent me through number.  Oh, yeah, true true, too.

1:50 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  We send a few emails through Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, they were very good. They are articles. You're a good writer.  Oh, I think yeah, yes Yeah, so how is things progressing with you?

2:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So since last time, I didn't do a lot of work stuff. But I've now scheduled kind of my master class thing at the end of next week, which is mostly around frameworks for consultants, upgrade frameworks.  And I can send you the link, but it's going be in Portuguese. I don't know how well the AI will pick it up.

2:35 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, if I can let you use in the week, you never know, with AI assisted, we'll see how we go.  Yeah.

2:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, I'll send you that link. It's not up yet. Yeah, I won't be able to, obviously, understand it.  Oh, maybe the transcript, yeah. Anyway, the point is that is the thing that's happening. I've also So I organized my content creation in a slightly different way and it's still early to say how long I'll be able to keep this up as profiles that struggle with the consistency of things.  We know this. But I think I've come up with a way that is easy for me. And there's also another thing that's kind of related to this.  A lot of things around content, actually, which is I'm kind of trying to see if I can, how can I say this?  claim, claim, coin, coin, coin and expression. Yes. So I've been an expression is I'm still playing with it, but the expression is expertise demo, like attack demo, but  expertise. I don't know if I said it right expertise.

4:05 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, correct. That's the that's your expression for whom.

4:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my thinking behind this is that we are used to seeing book a demo on websites, right? Yes. And for consulting, a demo would be kind of a workshop in a way.  So I'm trying to focus more on the idea of the purpose of said conversation, of like a beginner workshop, then the format.  Because whenever I say workshop, some people have different definitions of it, because it's kind of tool centric. Yep. And I'm thinking that expertise demo is a bit more outcome centric.

4:53 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Who's your audience?

4:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, still playing around with it. I guess this can It's better with, you know, the software crowd, but so is your model still to help experts productize their IP?  Yes, via workshop and framework. Right, okay.

5:19 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay, so I was going to, well, carry on. You're going through a list here. Yeah, this is not... No, yeah, I think this is like the third thing.

5:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's a masterclass coming up. I'm producing more content and I'm trying to see... I want to play the game of coining an expression.  Maybe basically that's it. I want to see, like, how long would it take for people to think of this thing and think about me?

5:48 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Expertise demo doesn't really mean anything. It doesn't work for you.

5:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But what does it mean? It's a demonstration of expertise, but... Is it something that you're proposing that consultants do?  Yes, it's like another name for a tasted workshop or started workshop. Right.

6:05 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  OK, so you are I get what you get. I get what you're trying. You need you want to you want to come up with something which will crystallize for them what it is they're getting out to creating a workshop.  So you because you are driving them, they've got expertise. Let's try to get to market. You help them productise that and you want to demonstrate what that might look like for them.

6:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, it's it's kind of matter, but basically I want to I want to help. Expertise businesses to have like a book, a demo sort of button, which is just scheduled a workshop, but that kind of that kind of idea.  Oh, it's just so easy to see how these guys think and work.

6:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  OK.

6:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But you're not the first one to to like arch your eyebrow eyebrows at this. So I think that is it.

7:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I don't know, there's no hook, there's no benefit for anybody, an expertise demo it doesn't mean anything. I mean it does in the sense that it's a demonstration of expertise but what you're talking about, the promise of having a meeting with you is that you will help them encapsulate all the bits and pieces that they've got which might be any number of different value propositions, they're probably too broad, they're probably not articulating it very well but a session with you will result in a workshop which will give them clarity about what it is that their value proposition is that they can use to articulate two customers.

7:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct, correct but I think maybe I didn't explain it too well so this conversation is very useful to me.  So here's my thinking and I'm not trying to be defensive, this is really good feedback so I'm just trying to practice having this conversation.  Yeah, this is less about my product offering and more about what I call the outcome that people would get out of working with me, right?  So instead of, let's say like, let's say you hire me, okay, let's say you hire me. And you come into my website and my website doesn't talk so much about workshop.  It mentions workshop, but it's not so much like workshop centric. But it talks more about the problem that you might be facing, oh, it's people don't understand what you do, or people only get it when they see you do it, or people need more proof before they commit, these sorts of pain points, right?  And then I say the solution for that is to have a way of demonstrating your expertise easily, like a demo for a SaaS product.  And the idea of coining that expression. I mean, it's kind of a game or a challenge, I don't know.  But the idea of joining that expression would be to not be compared to other workshop guys, but to have people think, I don't think it's like a mid to long-term sort of challenge.  I have people think, oh, I don't need a workshop, I need an expertise demo, and João is the guy for that.  So this is the thing in it. Okay.

9:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Okay. So what really, the outcome really is what you're actually helping them with is really their marketing. Because very often the workshop that they give is a means of engaging the customer first off, isn't it?  So you help them articulate what their proposition is. So what you're really doing is helping them, the expertise demo is really, they need to articulate their proposition such that customers inquire from them, how can you help me solve this problem?  Yeah, correct. Yes. Yes. And so Many small consultancies are not that clear on the problem that they solve Yeah, and that's about and so yes, they struggle to articulate what it is that they do So I think in order to start to do works and things and they need to make some commitment in terms of what it is that they do Do so Luke Smayers has just published something, you know Luke Smayers if I mentioned him before yeah I love his stuff.

10:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was taking his stuff earlier today He's just posted something today, which is if I was starting your consultancy.

10:33 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, this is how I would do it And it's all about zoning in on the clarity clarity of what it is that you do and having deep level deep expertise to do it Okay, and that's something that you can articulate with a workshop You build something around that so it's really this is the problem we solve The workshop is potentially a how we solve it But it's that so that's  That's what they're selling as consultancy. you haven't got that and it's hard to do a workshop, which is going be of any use to anybody.  That make sense? A lot of sense.

11:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes a lot of sense. I get quiet because I'm taking notes.

11:16 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  so it struck me that actually a lot of what you're, so your background is in product management, right?

11:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's not entirely on that, but that's my most recent one. Okay.

11:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Then what your skill is, is helping people articulate and visualise what it is that they do. Yeah. So you take often a written message and you make it something of people.  So you can turn something into a story.

11:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can do it. I wouldn't position myself as a story-telling sort of thing. I'm not saying you're saying that, but yeah.  Okay.

11:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I'm sure there's a lot of value in that, but I was thinking, is that value... Is that value? Is there a lot of points?  mean, basically, you are chasing consultants who really haven't got it sorted themselves yet, and you're going to sell them a service which will help them articulate their message and maybe win more business.  Yeah. they're in a declining market. Most of them are going to fail. so you're supplying, you're selling pans to gold diggers.  You're sending them a lifeline.

12:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I see your point. It's difficult to get repeat business out of clients that eventually go out of business.

12:42 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, the other thing is that once you've created the workshop, there is no repeat business, unless it's just refining because you've done that piece of work.  Yeah. And they've got to deliver it. The other thing is, is that workshop that they've created really anything different?  Is it really resonating? Is it going to resonate with customers? Is it going to be any better than what exists already?

13:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I see your point. I think, okay. So you have a lot of perspective on this, so I really value it.  And I'll take the opportunity of you helping me explore this. I came into these workshops for expert things because it's an intersection of things I'm interested in and I spend a lot of time in and I feel competent at.  But the workshop as a one-off product or a one-off service is a fragile kind of thing. And I think my...  My zone of, my circle of competence, I feel the most, is exactly how you described it, is in this kind of translation, bringing references and analogies from different places, making like weird stuff become a little bit easier to understand and so on.  And workshops are like one of the ways this manifests itself, right, but there's others. And I think my, so I'm agreeing with you on everything.  And my question is, am I missing something? Like, am I missing something? Is an unfair question towards you, but am I missing some skill or some ability of mine and focusing on the, betting on the wrong horse here?  Well, I think you might be.

15:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So there's some parallels with where I'm at. what I'm interested in is helping customers find the workshops which will help them solve the problem.  So the problem at the moment is probably around strategy and what do we do about AI. So there may be a workshop that will help them upscale their team.  So you wrote a piece recently and I kind of recognize this. You said the way we arrive at decision pass is a lot for how we trust the said decision.  So the workshop process, it's not the knowledge which is available to learn. It's the way of learning. It's working together to derive the decision so that people have a commitment to execute on it going forward.  That's the value of the workshop. It's the human element and it's the way that you learn. Because actually if you want answers you could go to AI and ask it to give me the answers and it will give you the answers but you won't have any buy-in from the people who then have to execute.  Yeah, this is a midterm problem because in the future would just be AI that does the execution as well and we'll all be out of work You know, there's an element of that's the direction but at the moment We're looking at mass AI adoption and So an element of that is what's our strategy?  So there's a workshop at the senior level, which is how do we work through what our strategy is? How do we collaborate?  You know the answer the possible and there's the upskilling of the people within organizations that that need to understand The impact of AI how they work together in that situation and where they can apply AI and There are and there are workshops around already that that exist to cover that and so One thing I've been doing is identifying and sort of building relationship with those those those workshop businesses so that so I can sell the workshops That makes sense.-hmm.

16:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and one of the questions I have is okay.

16:56 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Do I now have to educate the market as to what a workshop is? is and why they should be using the workshop or do I have already have an educated marketplace that know what a workshop, what value a workshop can deliver, but just need to know which workshop they need and which person they need to deliver it.  So that is where I'm at in terms of sense makers and because I think that my belief is that workshops are the thing in a corporate environment which will move things forward.  Understanding, working through a strategy, working through frameworks, simulations, training, the outcome is a shared process of learning that moves the organisation forward and so I think workshops have a lot of value in that sense.  don't think people need the value of consultancies diminishing because the the advice that consultants can give is is is becoming a commodity.  Unless you want the human element but actually what you want is the human element of the people you already have but you just want them to be informed because they have the context of what it is that what needs to be addressed.  So if you bring into that context AI knowledge and the process of working through so for example there's one company I'm talking to who are a five-day workshop where they have experts there on the art of the possible and they go from an idea to an MVP in a week and then they'll do the development for you but they'll use AI to do it.  So it's rapid development. It's many around sort of AI agents and things. How are we going to use agents in the business?  So one of the things for me is I think there's a need for that but the people who have the workshops are not regularly selling them or that's not what I think I can sell their workshops.  The question is do I engage the customer around the problem that they're having so if I can get them to talk to me because they're experiencing a problem I say I could solve that problem and then I say I solve that by introducing workshops or do you already know you need a workshop and my solution is which workshop you need that makes sense.  Is it a directory or we're already talking to me because they think I can solve the problem and the way we're going to do that is by introducing you to a workshop.  for example you have an issue around the design sprints or sorry an issue around collaboration or you have an issue around what we're going to do so it might be that you might need a design sprint which will help you do this but you don't think in terms because you're a customer you don't think in terms of workshops or facilitators.  I've actually had a look at some conversations on facilitators' club around setting and I'm trying to distill that down into some sort of best advice around how to sell workshops.  Then the answer seems to be not to sell workshops because that's not what people buy. They're trying to buy answers, solutions to problems.  Does that make sense?

20:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, it makes sense, it makes sense. I'm organizing my thoughts here.

20:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  The reason why I'm telling you all this is because a long-winded way around that is that the education piece, one where you can go, if you can articulate the value of workshops and facilitation generally, articulate to the customer the value of workshops and facilitation such that they can then say, well, I've got a problem, is there a workshop that will help me solve this problem?  when you do the match and then you can monetize that. Does that make sense? other thing I'm thinking is you don't need thought leadership from every half-rate small consultancy that's probably not doing anything very original.  The IP already exists from other people. So why not learn how to sell it? Does that make sense?

21:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you rephrase that? I heard that every word, just...

21:34 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, you sell it better than they do. what I'm thinking is basically, can I create demand for workshops that I know about so that I can basically broker the demand to the people who provide the workshop?  So that's the people who own the workshop IP and the facilitators who can deliver it so that you become  an aggregator, become the place where people come to to find the workshop that they need to solve the problems that they're having.

22:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that's what you do, right?

22:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes, that's what I'm so what I'm thinking about those in terms of us and maybe collaboration. Is articulating is rather than rather than persuade consultants who aren't producing workshops and to do them.  What you do is you articulate the value of workshops to customers. Because I think a lot of the value of what you're doing is it persuading educating people about the value of workshops.

22:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I make that is just the gears turning. Okay, let's let's role play. is a little bit so let's imagine that there's a there's there's this guy this guy has yeah it works for a energy company I don't know in Spain whatever and they're concerned about rising energy costs for AI whatever and uh they have a lot of a lot of questions around strategy and they need to find ways of having difficult but important discussions that will you know yeah shake up the tree and annoy the bees and that yeah so this guy uh he knows you because you have this network and it talks to you and says man Tim I've been having this this issue and because you you speak both languages you talk to him and you realize oh tell me more about this issue what's what's hurting what why do you think we should be talking so on and then you come up and come up to this guy let's say it's Javier hey Javier I think what you need is the workshop from those guys in Moldova that they have they  in doing this thing. That's very interesting work. What I immediately think about is, do people stay on their workshop offers for long enough for us, for you to know about the existence of this workshop in their service portfolio.  Let's say like these guys in Moldova, they've been trying, they've been trying this new workshop for like three weeks, let's say.  You're talking about Nick, Hemavish.

24:42 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah.

24:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I spoke to Nick today, so that's why Moldova is on my mind, but I wasn't talking about Nick.

24:48 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, okay, okay, all right.

24:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, okay, could be Nick, be Nick, nothing against Nick, I like Nick. So let's say that Nick is trying out a new format, right?  Experiment with

25:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  new format and it's been experimenting with this maybe for three weeks so unless you and Nick keep I don't know maybe that this is like exactly what you do I don't you keep talking all the time and you know exactly what's coming up you won't know that Nick is building that thing to tell this guy did I understand it um yes although see okay so the way I'm thinking is is so you know where I'm at in terms I've got the brand I'm talking to two people that we're sort of working on this together so I've got a guy who's who's one of the things is to define the problem so if you can gauge the customer in a conversation you get them into a dialogue and you help them analyze what the problem is and then so you know we're struggling with this okay sounds like you need a workshop that'll solve this problem for you or we can solve this problem the way we do is this and then you hook them and you either you refer the other people to do the workshop or you deliver it using your own  facilitators or resources. But I'm thinking, okay, so I've found three companies that do AI orientating, partly because AI is a new thing that, and workshops can help them, upskilling and decision making around AI, which is top of mind for everybody.  And so that would be a first entry point because we can market that. And then we cut a deal with these people and we get a cut of whatever it is.  We have a commercial arrangement so that we effectively either license or we deliver or we broker to them and they deliver.  The point you're doing is capturing the customer. So we get very good at marketing workshops as a solution to business problems.  That's what we become known for.

26:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

26:55 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Useful skill.

26:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Useful skill.

27:00 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's a useful skill. so if you can do that, then on the supply side, you can source other suppliers of workshops, depending upon what customers are looking for.  there are good people. So there's, for example, strategizer that you no doubt know about, strategize. So there's no point in trying to go and be a half rate strategizer.  You're better off negotiating a deal with strategizers than saying we have an opportunity for you to go and deliver value for these people.  So you have a commercial arrangement. You become a marketing front end for you broker and you connect. Does that make sense?  Yeah, yeah. And the other thing that you can do is as you create a channel of work or you start to, as the market tells you what it's looking for in terms of these are the problems that we are experiencing, then you can go and see.  source, people who solve those problems. If there are workshops you sell them, if they're not, you create them for working with them or we create our own workshops to fulfill the demand that we're generating from the customer.  Does that make sense?

28:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes sense.

28:18 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  The other thing you do is distill what we know about AI workshops and create our own. So it becomes part of the portfolio of products that we sell.

28:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I might be grieving a little bit, but I think everything makes sense.

28:47 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So it might be what, sorry?

28:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Grieving a little bit.

28:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Grieving, yeah. Why grieving?

28:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For this, for this feeling that, you know, AI steals all the oxygen in the room and just is either AI or the highway?  Well, no, not really.

29:11 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So bear in mind that a lot of the solutions to AI is going to be people. So firstly, people need to make decisions about how they utilize AI and people need to work alongside AI.  AI is going to have an impact on the way that people communicate and work together. And so this needs to be ironed out and worked through.  So, but it is a fact of life that it is playing an enormous part in everybody's strategy and their response to the markets.  So what I'm thinking is this is an immediate problem that people are experiencing and the workshops that address it are new.  So they don't have market share. People don't generally know about them with facilities that haven't been trained to deliver them.  Now, the other thing we could do is, and I notice that people that are doing these training courses tend to, they're more inclined to train the trainer than they are to train the customer to do the workshops, which is very along the lines of aging and smart.  So they're creating a delivery base, but they're not creating the demand for these people to get to market. So let's assume that there is a need for facilitation.  You've got a lot of people who can do facilitation, but those people are poor at marketing, and the people who train them are not doing marketing for them yet.  aging and will begin to do marketing for them, but they'll only deal with the top one cent of them.  So they're trying to turn from both ends. So what I'm proposing is that we we forge a channel to communicate with the customer so that they come seeking facilitation and workshop to  solve the problems that they have and all I'm saying is that the sharp end of that is very often is going to be around AI.  So even if it's a strategic workshop with strategy tools or somebody like that, it's very likely you can't have a strategy without taking into account what the impact of AI is going to be on your strategy, where does AI play?  it's just a thing. So it gives us an opportunity to be new, if that makes sense, because it's novel already.  If we came up with a workshop, which is all about how do you get people to collaborate, there are umpteen different workshops that already do that, and there's umpteen different companies that already do that.  But if you help a company figure out how to deal with a certain aspect of AI, then you're current.

31:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so maybe this is off-putting. I get really quiet in a look towards the, but I'm just thinking about this, okay?  But do you feel, so, when you talk about doing something together or a partnership or something I'm like, you have the skill to create this pipeline.  I'm not good at that, you know? To create what, sorry? To create this pipeline. Okay, okay. So maybe I'm being short-sighted, it's not very clear to me how I can do something for you that, I mean, I don't know.  exactly how I can be useful in this.

33:03 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, I think that you're, I was going to ask you, I jumped the gun a bit. So what I was going to ask you is to kind of show me some of the work that you've done.  So if you take an IP and you turn it into a framework or something, the visual stuff that you do, useful to see that.  I think your writing is very, very good. And I think you're very articulate in terms of how you express the value of things like workshops.  express the stuff you sent me, you're kind of expressing the challenges of articulating what your value you bring, but equally you can express the hour of workshops and facilitation.  So that's what I was thinking there. So the other thing that I would see you being able to do is creating package IP around workshops that we other wanted to create or align ourselves to  experts to start to articulate what it is that they do, what their thought leadership contributes to create a workshop based on their thought leadership.  I think potentially that then means that it's our IP. Would that be right?

34:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. I really don't know. One of the things, one of the angles I've been wondering about but I didn't put too much energy behind this is non-fiction authors.  Because you write a book and the book is not really a revenue stream, it's just an authority building. And then if you play that game well, eventually you start getting invited to keynotes and even workshops, stuff like that.  But being a non-fiction author usually means that you're a subject matter expert, maybe use the ghostwriter anyway. But it doesn't mean that you know how to deliver a workshop.  Well, that was one of the so I'm sharing this with you more in the sense like I'm thinking about where are where are the demand aggregators for this?  Yeah. And yeah, so you're okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I have a confusing way of thinking out. you still thinking?  No, no, I'm just noting like you said two things like the value of workshops and also create our own.

35:28 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so so one thing I've been doing for years is is keeping track of who certain experts are in certain areas.  So I know what problems they can solve. So I could go to them and say, well, you know, I don't even need to.  think if something has been published and it's common knowledge, then there's nothing stopping you as part of a workshop from from from educating people as to what this thought leadership is and how you might then execute it within the organization.  So you're educating people about what it is, how to use it. That's a workshop that you would own and you're also at same time promoting the person which you have to attribute it to them.  This person has come up with this thinking, this is how you can apply it within your organization and here's the benefit.

36:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Still like, for instance, Asia Armstrong with the productized book, right? Let's say, have you read that book? Asia Armstrong.

36:27 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yes. I think I might have bought it and not read it. Oh, that never happened to me. I always read every book I buy.

36:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, God, get that.

36:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  My ex-wife gave me a thing years ago which was basically, I love the idea of a good book.

36:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But then she's talking literature.

36:51 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I do read a lot of business stuff. Anyway, let me go. Yes.

36:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So as an example, trying to translate. What he told me is let's say I read this book from this person and say, oh, this is some really good ideas And I create a workshop around it and I've mentioned the person I attribute the credit I guess this would be legal, but it just feels very weird To me well that's something we need to find out the other thing is actually what you do as you work with them mean so that we'd like to do some workshops around your thought leadership Would you be happy with that you get a car if we sell them?

37:29 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  But then you also What you also do if you're getting current Current thought leadership around workshop solving current problems then you can Train the facilitators who'd be already been trained a facilitation.  You can train them in this workshop, and then you can help them basically Help them with their marketing to deliver the workshop That makes sense I Think so, yeah

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so.

38:08 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So, yeah, yeah, I think so.

38:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, okay, um...

38:14 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I've bamboozled you, haven't I?

38:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A little bit, a little bit, but I appreciate that. I think I'm the right guy to bamboozle. don't I don't get offended by it.  I try to invite it. Uh, it's a good word. Don't use it often enough. So I'll just think out loud to share with you what's going through my mind instead of me just looking into the void that you're just trying to imagine.  So a few things going through my mind. First one, um, yeah, the the the the fear of betting on the wrong words, uh, real, um, that the observation that AI is the big thing nowadays, very real.  The idea that the skill of translating the ship into experiences, a.k.a. on a broader level, not necessarily workshops, makes sense too, well, to me.  The idea that there are ways of talking about workshops today that connect with the pain points that people are feeling today, like for a post that would probably make sense is AI problems that a workshop can help with.  This kind of thinking, I didn't see it this way before, but the way you presented now makes a lot of sense to me.  And so all these things are going through my mind, and also I'm trying to balance this I always get like these whenever,  Talks of maybe partnering you up for something come up. I always get like hyper cautious because I don't want to let people down And I think it's important.  I say it like this so it doesn't come across as standoffish or aloof Because I always I keep thinking like oh can I make sure that I'm you know valuable for this partnership How can I can make it work?  So yeah, all of these things are going through my mind.

40:22 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  There's a few questions not a lot of answers right now Mission accomplished I well, I Can I can see all in my head in this The thing to do is execute on it but the principal thing is to create Create the demand for these workshops isn't it?  Yeah. Yeah, and I just I thought that you You'd be good at articulating why workshop and facilitation is important and valuable in the current context.  You'd also be good at creating the workshops for the IP as we identify it. So, for example, if I found a thought leader that we cut a deal with the workshops, then we do that.  We create a product out of their IP. There'd be a commercial arrangement, but we would have basically created something that they allow us to use, which we then sell.

41:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, yeah, I like both of those ideas.

41:35 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  And the other thing is that you can do workshops, can't you?

41:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I talk about workshops because that's something I can do. I was forced to talk about workshops because of the algorithm.  I want people to know that I do this and then yeah.

41:54 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So the proof is in the pudding. At the end of the day, you could deliver a workshop. But then I've been mapping out lots tons of facilitators as well in terms of who can actually deliver different types of workshops.  So that gives us a ground base of people who are trained and capable of delivering workshops but I think we know that they struggle to get to market.

42:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah my thinking on that is I'm not entirely sure but I have a high degree of confidence on this is that workshop people they tend to be not all of them but they tend to be very curious about tools and certifications and stuff like this.  Yeah so they don't stand still and they have a high felt sense of cognitive agency but they're like I can learn this thing right yeah and the mode is what you said which is like they keep learning they I am they right keep learning the tools but not developing the client acquisition skills.  right? So it's either in my mind, very open to be corrected. It's either like a kind of a certification play, which is like, or just a pure workshop, similarly, kind of thing, which is like, we just know the, the weird guy from, let's not say Moldova, because this is not about Nick, but I know from Cyprus that it really has this different thing.  But my point is, isn't this a little, because workshops are very high touch, right? And it's impossible to keep that relationship as the first sale.  It's a bit like booking the same Airbnb twice. second time you just do it outside the Airbnb.

43:52 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Oh, you mean the consultant, the facilitator will go back and work directly with the customer. for the second, there is that, um, all you do is you basically facilitate, you make, you make sure that the, so you effectively, you own the customer, um, so you have an agreement to provide this facilitator for this particular workshop, in terms of conditions, um, you exclude that from happening.  It very much in the same way that, because obviously my background is recruitment, in the same way when you provide contractors, freelancers, um, they can't go back direct, so the customer will come back to you and say we'd like to have Jeff again to do a workshop for us, so you own the customer.  Got it.

44:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just betrayed my naivety on this. that's fair enough.

44:44 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  It's, it's, it's good point. I mean, it's called, uh, I can't remember what called now. Yeah, the danger with any introductory type platform is that people then go direct, and it's a big deal with, with, with, um, with Airbnb, for example.  Uh, I know it happened. the moment you fall because you form a relationship with the with the owner and then you talk to them directly and you get back again and they say 15% of whatever the deal is.  The way you manage that is either it's potential penalties so what it would do is say look if anybody does this we find out that you've done it we're removing from our from our catalogue but yeah you're right you're right but we can we can we can deal with that through through contractual relationships.  But the important thing is can we can we create demand for workshops? Yeah that's a big question correct yes.

45:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so I don't know all the steps to it but I think so. It's like those trends in management consulting right every decade of  So there's a new thing that people ask, it's process optimization, it's design thinking, it's the, now it's AI. Yeah.

46:13 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Well, AI is different because AI is a different purpose tool. It's different to, it's not a fad. And it's not a discrete thing.  It's an everything. So the tide's coming up. How quickly can we learn to swim? Because we're going to have to, is kind of where we are at.  But that creates the imperative that people do something.

46:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

46:54 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  I've just, I've just been looking at some companies that I that I think I can sell their product, so that's one of the things that I would do is to sell, is to try and get customers to engage on, or we're struggling with this, whatever we're going to do about upskilling, get the inquiry and then map them to the company that can help do the upskilling, which they do through workshop or a simulation or training.  So that's the match. if you're struggling with this, where do you start? Where do you look? Because there are lots of small companies providing these services, but which one are you going to use?

47:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, that's another interesting angle for content, which is how to evaluate if facilitation provider is right for you, right?

47:52 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, I mean, you may think you made a comment in one of your posts about sense. Yeah, if you're a specialist, it can help make sense of the world you're  your treasure, you have treasure on your hands. So that's that's the sense-making thing. So I think we kind of agreed on the sense-making is a term.  That's also a good line. You're a writer, you kind of, you create imagery well.

48:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  feels really good to hear that from a native speaker. Thank you. Oh, yeah, no, it's very good.

48:21 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  You wouldn't know from your writing that you're not a native speaker.

48:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so enough with me cold-feeding and so on. How can I help you or help us, don't know, keep this experiment moving forward?

48:40 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  So I've probably jumped the gun a little bit in the sense of talking about working together. does the idea of doing it resonate?  Does it sound like a good thing for you?

48:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It sounds it sounds like a good thing. Yeah, when I said I was grieving is because of like my mental image of what my business is, but I think I'm just being a bit too scaredy about it.  I mean, we're not making any commitments now, I understand that, but I mean, this is really worth it, because all the playing field, I think, is exactly as you described, so that's very, you know, encouraging.  It seems to be, yeah.

49:30 - Tim Ellis (Digital Transform)
  Yeah, so it's definitely a thing, where I'm at, I suppose I could show you a Myero thing, in terms of...  Shall I show you this? I could show you this, but it's not going to really demonstrate much to you, or demonstrate more my lack of Myero expertise.  I'll just remove the note taker.
