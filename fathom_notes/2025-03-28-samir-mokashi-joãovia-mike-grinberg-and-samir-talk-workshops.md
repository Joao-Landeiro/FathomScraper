0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  wrong? No, I'm fine.

0:01 - Samir Mokashi
  Yeah. Okay.

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Samir, Samir the way?

0:07 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think Mike connected this, right?

0:12 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes. Yes. So yeah, I got connected with Mike on LinkedIn. And just as a fellow entrepreneur, he made he had a post somewhere that I thought was very interesting.  So I commented on it. And he kind of replied back to me and we connected and we talked a little bit.  And then he said that it would be great to, if I could talk with you as well. and wanted to talk to you and connect with you as well.  One of the things I'm doing is I'm writing a book about growing and existing a business. And I would love to interview you for that as well, if you're open to that.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am open to it. I don't Well, much value I have, I have on that front, but yeah, I'm open to it.

1:05 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes, I'm reaching out to all people at all levels of entrepreneurship. so hopefully everybody gets something out of the book.

1:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm writing a book as well. So I'm familiar with this process of interviewing a lot of people.

1:26 - Samir Mokashi
  What book are you writing about? What's the topic of your book?

1:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I create workshop sessions for consulting and agency companies. And there are a lot of books on how to run workshops.  But most of these books have been written from the perspective of just the facilitation, right?

1:47 - Samir Mokashi
  Which is what happened on the workshop.

1:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I couldn't find and I've been looking a lot of information on how companies that, you know, are trying to productize out of the  again productizing their services with workshops because it's okay it's not just about the facilitation tips or the exercise or the postage right right right something else so that's actually i i read this one have you read this one no i haven't read this one no it's really good it's can you see that the number of uh highlights it's like really recommended okay i just will look i note it down yeah a little bit about yourself as well i i know a little bit about you from your LinkedIn but tell me a little bit more about you as well for sure um so i'm Portuguese but i live in Brazil um been living here for 12 years and i went to school for industrial design and as a designer i've all i've  was always more drawn towards the abstract or functional aspects of things. I don't think I had enough good taste via successful branding designer or something like that.  And yeah, those guys that they like soccer, and they'd call that they would not be a player, but maybe they could be a coach.  I think it was a little bit like that. So yeah, I went to school for industrial design, and then I started to participate in a lot of these projects, like collaborative projects, where it's not obvious exactly what's the problem to solve.  You need to explore it together with the client. And at the time, design thinking was blowing up. Maybe I've heard the term design thinking, design sprint, that kind of thing.  And I worked a lot on that. And I really like it. see the power it has. But I have a pet peeve, is, I think, a lot of times, you know, design thinking, design springs, workshops, they get, they're not taken seriously.  They did not get taken seriously because the people running them are a little bit too shawashi, like charting, building vibes, which I mean, they have their place for sure.

4:24 - Samir Mokashi
  Right.

4:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But, but I think it's missing the point of, this is about structured collaboration on complex problems. It's not just about, know, follow your creativity, trust the process.  I mean, there's a logic to making it work. So I have strong feelings on that. And I did work on, you know, innovation consulting, that kind of thing.  I worked as a product manager. And eventually, I wanted to work on my own in the terms of being an independent consultant.  consultant. I really like it. And in that process of becoming an independent consultant, I started to notice that, you know, the thing that people are usually complimenting me on was this navigating different Zoom levels of the business.  Like, oh, this is a strategy thing. is a more tactical thing. But again, I think I'm also very aware of my limitations.  was like, I don't think I'm a strategy consultant, because I didn't get into MBB early on, and I don't want to spend my entire career streaming upstream, trying to get people to believe what I'm saying, like, need to be an independent consultant on the intersection of things that it's really, I'm really comfortable in.  So, yeah, I love the topics of expertise, how it works, systems, and fun. I think workshops and games are a little bit like that.

6:00 - Samir Mokashi
  I did a lot of code training and even more presentations than workshops in my past life. I'm an architect by training and my business was about code consulting.  So building regulations. And most architects hate regulations and I found regulations to be very creative. So I could help architects design better by walking them through the maze of regulations and show if you do this, if you do that, if you do that, and if I can do an alternate and the question of the jurisdiction, I can do this.  So I established a very creative code consulting business for me. And most people look at code consulting as because of this, right?  So it became a very successful business. I sold it two years ago. Me and my wife were the founders of the business.  so all owners of it, we sold it. And then I worked for the company, bought me. And by the time it sold it, had five offices, 40 people.  So we were really growing quite a bit in 11 years. And we sold it. And now I'm retired from the corporate consulting business, and I'm starting two businesses now.  So one is about business consulting. It's actually my pathway, starting from the ground up, growing a business in a very challenging environment.  We started in the recession, and we went to COVID, and after that we sold very well. So those kind of challenges that we overcome, our strategies of how to build it in the code consulting, there are no colleges that teach you to be code consultant.  We literally had to hire people and teach them and provide high quality service. We couldn't just go get the expert engineers or expert architect or expert consultants and do it, right?  So all of that kind of taught me a lot of things about running a successful business and creating a strategy that is successful.  And so now, I'm going to share my wisdom with people who already have businesses coming close to retirement. And many of them, small to mid-sized businesses just walk away or undersell their spread equity, right?  So I'm going to help them maximize that and also help them post-marriage. That is also a challenging field. People don't know what to do with the sale of their baby, right?  Some of them, it's their baby and their whole identity is tied to it. Others not knowing that they are not in charge anymore.  how do they interact with the world when they don't have any power, suppose, all of these things are important and I can navigate people through that.  So that's one business. In the second business is I have a sauce, the secret sauce that I created. I made small batches and gave it to friends and family and everything likes it.  And now I'm going to commercialize it and sell it and see how that goes. actual sauce.

9:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, I thought it was like an analogy, but does it? No, no, actual food company.

9:07 - Samir Mokashi
  So there'll be a food company and it'll be consulting company.

9:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can tell you like the work, you like to work, right?

9:14 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes, yes, yes. So that's kind of where I might, it's a career change, you know, it's not two people at 60 think of a career change, but that's a career change for me.  So it'll take me a little bit longer to get everything lined up, and especially when I'm doing two business trials.  But I'm excited about that.

9:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would also assume, and maybe, maybe I'm wrong, correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I would also assume that there are always similarities between businesses, but these two businesses seem quite different.  And maybe although the workload is large, it's kind of from the outside, it feels like maybe you can rest one side.  If you're mind working on a business and then your rest of the time, yeah, part of it is, is you're right.

10:06 - Samir Mokashi
  It is. There is a commonality in business. Uh, I, I, I realize why he realized to me, I have an ability to make see patterns in chaos when people look at something very complicated.  Oh my God. I don't know where to start and I can look at it and I can start seeing package.  It's okay. This is in this group that is for the disconnection that I can see that I can visualize that and it can communicate.  So, so that is something that that I've always has a continuity in business because always complex and as we're adding the book and I look back to my life.  If I started. Going to college, an architect stayed in the architecture and grown and it had a senior architect for the principal of a form of revenue and linear career, right?  When people like me who are entrepreneurs and also you, we don't. right and all the other life is a group of short stories.  Yeah, it's the same author writing it, but they're different stories. Yeah. And so that's how my life is. And so that allows me to do different things that are seemingly different, but following that common underlying pattern, if you may, right?  So that's been the kind of the fun part. But at the same time, the two different industries that use me some buffer against losing everything.

11:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So they might take off at different stages, right?

11:38 - Samir Mokashi
  Because one might be going strong, other might be going slow, and then this might take off, and this might be slow.  So that diversity and diversification can be a benefit as well. It does stretch me, but it also gives me more options.

11:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, I can see that for sure. And I would guess that The kind of pattern recognition that you are, you know, very adept is the finding opportunities, right?  So when you talk about what he did with the code, in my mind, that's a little bit like the...  So my wife, she works in corporate compliance, right? in here in Brazil, people that work in corporate compliance almost always come from the law world, their law expatriate, but she doesn't, she comes from a management, right?  So she says like, it's easy to be a compliance officer if you just say that nothing is allowed. The value is in finding ways that are still legal above board and everything to make things possible, right?  So I would just... I'm using these emails to think about your...

12:55 - Samir Mokashi
  Well, it is exactly like that. It is exactly like that. And a lot of times the crime would come...  me and say, here's my problem. And I would talk to you a little bit and say, no, that's not your problem.  Let's find the problem this way. And now we can solve it. Oh, I didn't think of that. What I do.  So part of it is understanding the complex. And part of it is simplifying the complex. I take things away, or commonly then add things on.  What is complex by itself? So even in this business, where should I go? Who's my client? It's actually not this two companies, two companies.  I want to find a blue ocean where there's very few people playing. And that's how I find my kind of focus.

13:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the management one is a competitive market, right?

13:48 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes. But what I'm going after is the smaller companies. lot of them are playing for the 10 million. If you come under 10 million, then you're  not just executive coaches, not business strategies. They have standard practice, they don't really know how to do this, all the complex issues, they give you the same thing over and over, and it's a hidden myth.  50% of the time, 50% will be a waste of money. And then I also have relationships with architectural engineering businesses who are my clients and I was their client.  So I have a ready book of business there. And then, if I look at that Pacific Northwest, where I'm located, Seattle, Oregon, Washington, there's not many M&M folks in this market.  They're in the South, they're in the Southwest in California and other places on the East Coast, but not here.  So I can work with the big boys and give them a local presence here.

14:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it.

14:47 - Samir Mokashi
  So kind finding out a little bit of open space where I can wait and nobody's there. Yeah, it would say exactly the pattern that we were talking about finding the open space.

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, where to play, right? Where there's less competition. I'm really drawn to this idea that you can replace, not fully replace, but you can request a little bit of help or grease by taking the time to see where the leverage points are.

15:26 - Samir Mokashi
  Yes, yes, that's very well said.

15:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, just trying to compete on the same level as everyone else seems exhausting and boring, because I'm sure you're very creative as well.  So that's why you do that. And part of it is the same thing.

15:45 - Samir Mokashi
  It's not about running fast. It's doing about what road you want to run on and how far you want to go.  And then you can pace yourself. If you don't know your destiny, and if you're not a clear vision of your role, then you might be running  are uphill when you should slow down and running fast downhill when you see pace yourself, right? So those kind of understanding of the context around you are at least a sense of conduct.  You don't always know everything, right? But if you can take the time to look around you, that really helps.

16:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, point I would like to learn more from you. From what I understand, a big part of your consulting business is around Exit, M&A.  Is Exits and M&A from all sorts of business or specific kinds of businesses?

16:47 - Samir Mokashi
  I will start with Architectural Engineering Professional Service Providing firms because that's my direct client base. But I could go from there to other businesses as well.  So the thing that I will bring is trust and love relationship. So the businesses often do business with somebody they like and who's similar to them.  So rather than a consultant who went to an MBA telling them an entrepreneur who was in the trenches just like them, as you feel this guy knows what I'm doing, this guy understands me, right?  This guy can relate, I can relate to, right? So that's going to my commonality, my connection to people who may not always know me in the industry, the fact that I went through.  The other thing is, I'm an immigrant entrepreneur. I came as an immigrant, I came with nothing. Nobody helped me, nobody gave me a handout.  I earned every single month job that I earned, right? So that there's a lot of authenticity in that, right?  The struggles are real, the successes are real. nobody gave me anything. I actually fought up here every time, one because I'm an immigrant, because I'm a brown-skinned, and I'm an accent, right?  So all of these, but not, and I've seen the difference when somebody who doesn't have these come in, right?  And so I know what I've achieved, and I can do that. So that also is an asset that I bring to the table that can connect with people and allow me to do so.  my son actually is going to study finance and going to to investment banking. He wants to not take on that company, he wants to start his own company.  But if I establish a business that has a relationship, he can take that relationship and build upon it as well.

18:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. I want to explore this because it's a subtle, interesting point. So building a company, okay, so

19:00 - Samir Mokashi
  uh inheriting a company is not something that you know is interesting to your son at this point because he wants to you know trail is on path for sure but at the same time there is another kind of aspect that you can inherit which is the relationship to okay that is so so i'm looking at creating generational wealth okay and i have enough money for myself my children and maybe their children but i don't want to just give money i want to teach them how to make money as well so in the food business i got seven of my niece and nessie and nephews going to be minority partners and i'm going to give them each five percent equity and no expectations except they watch the company girl literally and and and we're not from this family right so we don't have that kind of exposure so these young professionals they're  all fresh out of college or just finishing college at that level, right? once they go through this, they will build resilience and they will get exposure about things that you don't.  I didn't learn this till I was 50. I started as what takes to start a business, what kind of things you have, which lawyer will go to none of that.  That's building a more family foundation beyond just the individual. For sure.

20:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I can see that. can see that. And in the context of M&A of services firms, so I've been kind of curious about that.  I didn't really go deep. It's just something that has been on my radar. And the motivation is very clear.  Workshops are kind of intellectual property, right? Are a way of translating a method or a way of working into specific engagements.  So they do give shape to a process that companies might have. And one of the things I've been thinking about is, okay, maybe workshops, they are, they could be framed as part of an IP package.

21:12 - Samir Mokashi
  if I say- Actually, that's what I want to talk to you about because I'm looking to build those kind of presentations and workshops now.  that's what I might talk that I should talk to you because you build these and you might be able to come.  So, the workshops is a good marketing tool. This is not, you don't give a workshop and then they're done.  And people say, okay, I got everything I I'm good. So, workshop means for people to become aware of the complexity, become aware of what it takes and realize that they know parts of it, but they don't know other parts of it.  And the parts that they know, they have to put in effort before the other consultants can really add value.  So, if they go in half prepared, they get less or better. for sure right so so those are the things that i part of it is uh the american instinctive architects is an architects association that i've been part of teaching lectures and giving workshops on on building codes and the architects for many many years now i'm using that connection to give them a bit business uh how to grow a business and to exhibit the two seminars in or Oregon want to grow business and a big one of the things that architects find challenging how to open a second office many fail they just stay in one place that's a challenge for them opening a second office can get an additional revenue stream give us diversity and things like that going into a different category building category that is also challenging right how do you build those diverse uh main so that is about growth how do you go from 10 person from to 20 person from it's a big jump and you change two things right so those kind of things also i want to talk about to architects and help them get  about it. Because not knowing they keep doing the same thing they did when they were a five-person firm, when they're trying to become a 20-person firm.  And it doesn't work, their efficiencies go down, their people don't listen, all of that happens, right? So there's a method to the madness.  For sure. I want to create a workshop for that. And part of it is, when I think of a workshop, I hear that people learn themselves.  And I'm not quite sure how to teach people and how much to teach people about this, versus telling them come talk to me, I will get it to you.  I will do it for you. Got it. so when you do the workshop, how do you think about that?  About how much do you teach them, versus how much do you make them aware of what they do not?  Perfect.

23:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a very good question. like it. one of the things that one of the tenets I use to create these sorts of workshops is that sometimes people think about workshops,  and they think about the surface level like oh there's post-heats on the wall and stuff like that, right? But I prefer to think about them in terms of questions that you need answers to as an expert, so you can do your job, right?  And depending on the questions, some exercises make sense, some activities make sense and some others don't. And there's also another thing you can do with the questions, which is you can flow them to the pre-workshop or the post-workshop stage, right?  So you really keep the live time really dense and really rich, where the time they spend with you is like the most valuable and where you can shine.  For instance, some people are really good at thinking on their feet like experts said, they're very good at giving advice, high context, ad hoc advice.  So for people that work like that, it's interesting that we shape the workshop to give them a stay. For them to do that so that the audience sees you at your best some other experts they really like to improvise and they much prefer to have things systematized and You know the workshop be a more formal thing, which is also possible So the point is let's highlight the thing that you do best and But coming to your question because I didn't really Address it.  She's like, how do you keep things in and how do you keep things out, right? Basically, there's like a balance and I haven't formalized a formula for this But the balance that I consider is this Do you know the so you're an architect?  Maybe you're familiar with this You know that I have principle most advanced yet acceptable and so I use I use that a lot because You want to give people as something that they cannot do.  Yeah, I've heard of that. Yeah, that makes sense Yes, and then you add an extra thing that they didn't think about before but if you start with the extra thing with a new  information. Oftentimes people, they don't have a context for that. They might sense that you really know what you're talking about, but they don't know what to do with that information.  So, when thinking of what goes in, what goes out, I try to keep this balanced, like it needs to be relatable enough that they know how to organize that information in their mind, that knowledge, but it needs to be challenging enough so they feel that, okay, this was new, I'm learning new things.  And another thing that I think it's really useful is when you hint at complexity, but you show like, oh, there's more stuff, but we are focusing on this stuff.  just this week, this week, I was working with a client and we were creating a workshop for ICP definition, ideal client.  And one of the things he said was, ICP is often misunderstood, an accurate idea of what the concept of the ICP is and also there's so many variables and parameters you could put for your ICP definition.  In this workshop that we were creating we wanted the workshop to be short to be you know cheap to run if you need a workshop that's too long that's too much of your time and we've made the choice of let's show people how many factors can be included on the ICP but then we explained to them for this exercise we'll focus on this tree.  So I think there's two kinds of expertise that you are implying with this move the first one is that this is deep and you know this is deep I could talk about this and the second one which is I'm such an expert that I have a good sense of what matters the most at each stage right but if you don't show people that you have done this filtering if they if they have no idea that you're showing them three things but there's 50 out  They have no way of knowing that there's more in that you've applied your expertise to reduce the complexity. Is this the sort of answer you were – Yes, yes, that helps me understand.

28:20 - Samir Mokashi
  So how do you work with your clients? What kind of clients do you work with and what do you do for them?

28:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So mostly advisory firms and also agencies. But I'm trying to get more advisory firms because – You know, advisory firms are usually staffed by clever people, right?  But the point is they sometimes become affected by the curse of knowledge. They're really clever. They know a lot of things.  They don't know how it is not to know those things. And this is impossible to do.

29:00 - Samir Mokashi
  if you try to.

29:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But at the same time, like subject matter experts, they tend to have a certain love for the craft and for the complexity and for the nuance.  It's a very interesting attention, like they have knowledge that is really valuable, and a lot of people would benefit a lot, even if they get just a portion of it.  For instance, I'm sure this is an interaction you've had at some point. have many years of experience with building codes.  And you can enter a conversation and very quickly say, oh, what matters here is this point. This is a typical expertise pattern.  For the person that received this insight from you, those five minutes, they have the leverage that is difficult to calculate.  They change their entire outlook on the profession. So the point is, if you are an expert that knows thousand facts about an area.  And you feel stuck because you don't know how to communicate these thousand facts about your topic. The funny thing is, you're such an expert that maybe you don't realize that if you just use two of those facts, that would be really valuable for people that are much lower in the competence.  And this sometimes trips experts up. They know that what they have is valuable. Sometimes they have these efforts in trying to productize it or try to package it and start things.  But it's difficult to find the people that do this. Sometimes they try to ghost writers, which I think some of them can help.  think some ghost writers are really good at picking the way you think, not what you're saying. I think some are very good at this.  And sometimes they go to advertisement agencies because they're creative and maybe they have ideas, but usually advertisement agencies, they're like 80% production line and maybe 20% creativity.  So they're highly visible as a business, but they don't really have the skills. And so it's frustrating, I think, for everyone involved, like for the experts that want to teach and experts become experts because they love their field, right?  If you are in it just for the money, it's gonna be a guy that's in it for the love of it and it's gonna be better than you.  I think for the money can take you very far, but the best experts at any field, they really like the field.  So then it's frustrating for everyone. It's like amazing, not just knowledge but wisdom that is locked inside of a brain that was fine-tuned to operate at a level that most people don't operate.  evolve mostly around interviews, asking you, like role playing, what about the situation? What would you do? Why would you do that?  What kind of decision do you see here? What kind of criteria do you have for this decision? it's a bit of a fractal because you can do many levels on each decision point.  And by doing this, usually the experts in the process, they start to realize, oh yeah, yeah, there's a method to the methods, like you said, and then it becomes much easier to formalize.  So it's tacit expertise, and then it can become formalized or explicit expertise. When you have that, when you have that mental model of how an expert thinks, then you can do so many different things with it.  can write books, create workshops, create courses, stuff like that. I'm sorry, this was a little bit of

34:00 - Samir Mokashi
  No, it helps me think things through for myself as well, but I'm coming to it was very and you made a very good point that the experts don't know that others don't grasp what they know.  Yeah. And fortunately, I've been generally aware of that so I can give them a broader context and bring them to that and explain it in a simpler term.  And people have always appreciated you explain the complex. the thing that I often struggle with is I skip steps.  I go from step one to step 10.

34:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'm curious. Tell me more about it.

34:40 - Samir Mokashi
  So because of my experience and because of the pace that I reach at human analysis, I come to a conclusion much faster than many others.  So and then I say, okay, here's the problem. And here's what we should focus on. How did you get from here to here?  Yeah, right? And if I don't explain that, I come across as arrogant, trying to be arrogant or too disconnected.  So I had a few staff that I said, okay, you have to watch me and tell me when I'm doing that because when I'm conscious about it, I notice it.  When I get passionate about it, start getting it. Yes, yes, yes.

35:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We get animated.

35:31 - Samir Mokashi
  So understanding that is the mark of a good teacher.

35:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Absolutely, absolutely. And it's also, it hints at a commitment to the students transformation, right? Because some people know a lot of things, but they don't care if the students get it.  They just say it. There's a lot of college professors that have this kind of approach.

35:52 - Samir Mokashi
  Right, right.

  So, I mean, this is interesting. interesting. I'd love to talk further. Do you have like any specific plans on those or intentions on those workshops or you're still exploring this?

36:14 - Samir Mokashi
  I'm developing it, but after we have talked, you'll me some idea. Let me synthesize them, put it down in a piece of paper.  I think the eliciting the answers part is very good and different than what I did, because I never elicited the answers in my past presentations.  I was eliciting the problems. What is the problem? So then they can come to me as the solution, right?  So, so listening to our services, making them think about their problems. And that's the challenge in this case, because at the core level, they've already come to the higher level in the business.  They're not there because they're focusing on the product or service delivery. That actually very many of them are neophytes when it comes to the  business part. So I need to bring them along to a higher level without making them look stupid.

37:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that is an interesting challenge because we tend to assume that competency in one area translates to competency in other areas and it's not always like that.  That's interesting.

37:19 - Samir Mokashi
  our discussion today helped me see that, so that was definitely a great before we just by talking to you right now.  Oh, thank you.

37:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This was a good conversation. Perfect. So when start looking outside the frame, it's because I'm thinking in trying to connect dots on like next steps and stuff like that.  So what I'm thinking is you'll synthesize at the time, no pressure. And I will also kind of put together my ideas and thoughts in an email, maybe some references or things that I find interesting.  And we can keep this conversation moving in that sense. it is like exactly the sort of challenge that I love doing, which is translating the expertise of workshops.

38:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but it's two o'clock afternoon for you, it's almost six, no, it's four hours then, right? So you're 10 o'clock, right?  No, no, we are almost six o'clock.

38:42 - Samir Mokashi

Okay, this is really good.
