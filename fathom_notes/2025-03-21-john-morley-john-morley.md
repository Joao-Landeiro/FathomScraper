0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. You you are in California. I am we're about to you. I mean South of Brazil Curitiba, let me write it here.  Okay.

0:11 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I know I actually I know the name I've only I've only been in Brazil once I went to went to Rio So I know I know the name Curitiba, but I would be hard to find it on a map And I'm sure it's big It's like three million people the The whole urban area The the city itself is maybe a million, but then you know the satellite cities.

0:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you call it? The sprawl? Yeah, yeah Yeah, and it's like 800 kilometers. I don't know miles south of Rio.  Yeah, not on the coast It's on a plateau So it rains a lot. It's a weird plateau. It's it's a plateau surrounded by  mountains so the clouds struggle up the mountain and then they slend it's like a crater.

1:07 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm from Ireland originally so I know all about rain and mountains and just actually just a lot colder than it probably is with you that hopes.

1:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It gets cold here in this place but yeah not probably not the same.

1:22 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I visited Ireland and I was yeah very good a lot of Brazilians there now actually true true is they go for the language experience right when in English yeah and there's a lot of Brazilians people working there now and I guess in tech in different things I'm not sure there's one little town there's one little town on the west coast it's small it's only like 20 30 000 people and there are more Brazilians there than there are locals so when you drive through it it's funny it's like a little pocket of Brazil those Brazilian flags and like the pubs and stuff have Brazilian names there's Brazilian restaurants.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very strange. What's the name of the place?

2:02 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  It's called Gort, G-O-R-T. No, never did it mean it just means field It's in them.

2:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's in the absolute middle of nowhere, but it's Brazilian town Very strange Somebody told me a really funny start and you to remember it because Okay, I think it was something like this I Think in Ireland Some there was a pub Where at some point a Brazilian guy had worked at right it didn't work there anymore, but while the guy had worked there he had convinced It's the the regulars and the other employees that there's like a Brazilian football club That's like the best But it isn't he's a bad one like this for me city and it taught them the The the chance and I know the stuff what he what he's seeing in  And at some point some Brazilian guy, some other Brazilian guy arrived at this bar and that's something that was a trigger for this.  And then all of these Irish guys started singing the chant of this  football club. And the guy was really confused, the Brazilian guy, what's happening?  And then they told him, oh, this is because it means like, oh, this is the best club and so on and goes, no, it doesn't, that's not what it means.  And I thought, this is like typical Brazilian and the chief. I think Irish also have like a, yeah, a passion for this, the shivist thing, yeah.  What brought you to Ireland?

3:43 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  did you get there? I went to visit.

3:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm Portuguese. I live in Brazil, but I'm Portuguese. And I'm married to a Brazilian woman. And when we visit Portugal to see my family, we try to not make it just about see my family.  Yeah. Try to take a Ryanair flight somewhere. And yeah, we went there. We spent like 10 days, something like that.  Oh, that's interesting.

4:09 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Because you know, during COVID, an awful lot of Irish people went to Portugal because the weather in Ireland was so miserable.  And Portugal was like, you know, it's small, right? So similar size, it's actually bigger than Ireland, right? The population was bigger.  And the weather, yeah, Ireland is only, the whole island is only five million people. It's amazing.

4:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ireland totally really punches above its weight. We're noisy.

4:37 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  That's funny that you told me that. Of course, I the assumption that you were Brazilian. And then my son is 12 and his soccer coach is Brazilian.  we get a dose of the Brazilian humor five days away.

4:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and then you know, and then you meet someone that Jiu Jitsu and the coach is also Brazilian. Yeah, probably.

4:58 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Yeah, all the stereotypes go. Well I've been enjoying your stuff. this point I can say I don't even remember where I came across you last week or so, but I really like what you put out there.  Thank you.

5:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you so much.

5:12 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Yeah, I was curious. Tell me all about it. Anything at all, I'm just curious. It's always good to meet some good people.

5:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, likewise. I made notes like our conversation. went to look in your website. I have questions. mean, the website is very poor.  No, we always say that. We're never happy with our own websites, but it's fine. But so to give you a of context, thank you for saying that because sometimes I think you've spoken about this LinkedIn being cruel.  Yeah, sometimes it's a slog. But thank you for saying that. basically I, so I went to school for design, the squareest kind of design, like industrial design engineering.  but I was not good at numbers, so I wasn't very good at the engineering side of things. I was fascinated, maybe you can relate to this as well.  I was fascinated by the engineering way of thinking, and I wish I had paid more attention in school before that because I was missing like the lingo for the next level of engineering, right?  And then I was really intrigued by, systems thinking and all of this kind of stuff. And this was around the time that lean start-up and the whole entrepreneurship Silicon Valley thing was stepping out of Silicon Valley, was arriving in Portugal and so on.  Design thinking, I don't know, 10s, 2010s kind of vibe. And I was like, oh, I don't know the name of this thing, but I really like this thing.  And that was important because I didn't know exactly what I was going to do after school because I didn't  see myself as an industrial designer I didn't think I was good enough for that. I had noticed that I also didn't feel I had the taste to be a successful graphic designer because it feels very arbitrary to me.  I mean I value it. I'm not saying it's an interesting good difficult thing to do but I was like I don't think I have the sensibility to do well at this and um and then I was like oh so this design thinking seems interesting.  It was a name. That was very important. That was a name I could put on Google and it could sign up.  So eventually I was looking around for work some friends from Brazil that went to school with me told me hey the company we work at in Brazil likes people that studied what we did.  So I applied. I had never been to Brazil. I got the job. The interview was on Skype. I got the job and I moved here a visa.  We need a visa. from Portugal to Brazil the other way and typical gringo experience uh oh i'll stay for two years and then you meet the brazilian and you marry and you for a decade and yeah that's it but i mean sorry i went all the way to the big bang but the most recent thing is more recently i've been like oh this indie consultant is really interesting i love this indie consultant thing i love this and i was really struggling with positioning myself right because people don't know me or people that think the way i think they could see the value but everyone else was like yeah that's you're not stupid but i don't get what you do like it was very difficult to get referrals from that right yeah and then i would meet a lot of people that did the same thing that i did which is nice i like talking to my peers but usually there's not a lot of work from from that right it's just more it's a different kind of relationship and i was like i think i need a way of positioning myself that is different and i noticed that  I was genuinely, I am genuinely fascinated by three things, the topic of expertise, systems and fun, funds, games, workshops and stuff like that.  So I started to notice that I was, you know, orbiting closer to those things and eventually I said, you know what, I'm going to do like workshops for consultants.  I have done some, my wife is a consultant, she's also a new consultant on another thing, not really. And she ended up doing a lot of workshops because we live together and talk about these things, right?  And that worked for her. She does corporate compliance, which is a bit dry. And she stood out really, you know, really good way.  And it was like, okay, there's something in this. So that's it. I do workshops for consultants. And I'm at that stage where the way I explain this is starting to click more and more.  So the funny thing is, I'm learning so much more about, you know, marketing sales than necessarily the workshops. Yeah, it's really important.  And that's it. Thank you for listening to my monologue.

10:14 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  want to hear your side. No, no, and if you see me looking away, it's not that I'm looking away.  I have something for you. I'm going to see if I can put it in the chat. you know who Seth Godin is?  All right, so he has a great little book called. You you This book, which is kind of fun. I like this because in Ireland, when you can't say the  word, you say this.  So it's not an Irish book, but I like the guy used it. So just twisted my mind. Yeah, it's fun graphically like the big print page is like, let's talk about You he'll dive in and like he's got a piece about not trying to sell the book so much as, hold on a second, there I like, but what I like about it and what your stuff does when I see it is it grabs me visually and then it says something really simple and I was like, wake up.  It's it's this, I like that a lot and I think. I think a few different thoughts here is keep doing it because it's effective.  It looks good. I also realized something because I did a LinkedIn class a few months ago, and it was five weeks long, and it was pretty intense, and it teaches you all the tricks of LinkedIn, and I kind of decided at the end of it that I didn't want to be that invested in it, but one of the things I did learn is that if the more followers you have, the more your stuff gets amplified.  So the average number of impressions that you get for each post that you write is about 3% of the number of followers you have.  If you post as regularly as you do and get the number of likes, or impressions that you're getting well I'll just share with you that I get about 10% rather than 3% but what that made me realize was that I have like 3,000 followers I'd need to be having 25,000 followers to probably don't we all you know so it's kind of like that's where I kind of go to it and go well am I doing this because I like it or am I doing it because I'm trying to drive a business office and I would say do it because you enjoy it and then interesting things will happen I got last year I did a post in July I got 14 likes to it I think there's 16 now and out of the blue in October this conference organizer called me from Boston the post was a one-minute read and she said to me we have a conference and it's on a similar theme would you come over here and give the keynote and I created a keynote on it  Um, anyway, so that's just some thoughts and a bit of mixed thinking, but here's, here's a, I have a very similar entry into design as you and, and I'm not a designer.  I've self thought myself design thinking, but I worked for big tech companies and marketing and I would do, I ran what we're called executive briefing centers.  So if you were spending a lot of money, as you come to our campus, we'd give you a day of briefings on what you were buying and give you a tour.  And, and I did that and I worked with an awful lot of engineers. And, uh, one of my jobs there was every customer that came in, I would welcome them, ask them about what their interests were and tell them about our portfolio.  And I started to see gaps in the portfolio and I started to see gaps in how they were using it.  And so I would go to the sales guys and go, why aren't they doing this? And sales go, oh, I don't know.  Is that a thing that they could do. And then I would go to engineering and go, can we take this thing and that thing and put it together?  And would that work? And they would say, why? And I said, because I'm seeing patterns in how customers are saying, so the engineers would come in and sit and watch.  And they would go, oh, that's really interesting. We hadn't thought of that. Yes, we could, but we'd need somebody in the sales organization to, you know, give us the approval to go ahead with it.  And so we would go out to the sales engineers and they would go, oh, that's a great idea. Yeah, I'll bring you a customer, build that and see what happens.  And over a period of about two years, we went from nothing to we built a product. And that product generated a couple of billion dollars in revenue every year for five years.  And so the first year that we did it, I remember sitting back and somebody said, how did you guys do that?  And I was like, well, I don't know how to describe it, but kind of here's what we did. And I went into a bookstore one night for about three or four hours.  I went through every book in the business section until I found Tim Brown's book Change by Design.

19:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I realized, oh, that's what we did.

19:08 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  was design thinking.

19:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you got it from First Principles? Yes.

19:13 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Yeah. Absolutely. So after that, that was 2010. And after that, I would go in and I would say, ooh, let's talk about design thinking.  I have no idea what that is and no. So it's kind of been a journey of trying to figure out how to take something that I know works and articulate it.  Yes. And I'm also learning that being me the way I am, well, I could change it all so that more people understand it.  But then I wouldn't be me.

19:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does that make sense? It does. does. I struggle with this too. So yeah, I know what you mean.

20:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So, a lot of the time, like when I find somebody like you who's saying the thing I wish I could say and saying it better than I would say it, then I'm like, oh, fantastic, now I know somebody who knows how to fill that gap.  You know, and that's what I kind of, that's my strength is probably connecting people.

20:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mentioned the connection. It's really, I also like to like introduce people to each other and try to do it in the best way I can, like create a group between them, introduce them, leave, know, as warm an intro as I can.  And we know that's not very common, like only a few people do that, but you see the value of that.  And I understand it's really, it's really pleasurable to see like, oh, these people met because I introduced them and now they're doing something interesting.  It's a really great feeling. I love it.

20:55 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Let me.

20:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. No, you go ahead. So I I that I have another one at the hour.  I already asked for five minutes more, so we have a little. But we need to schedule another one for sure.  But I just thought that you don't want to cut you off.

21:15 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  How about this? How about this? I want to know. I have a good sense of, well, from what you post, I have a good sense of that capability you have.  But I'd really love to know what else you're interested in. And I have a very simple, for me, it's simple, right?  My interest is in, I have a phrase, I say, where people thrive, organizations prosper. And so for me, that is a mixture of good self-awareness, plus design and innovation skills mean you're very adaptive.  Uh-huh in your creative and if if a workplace allows you to be that then it benefits and it will grow That's my view of the world Yeah And so you can see immediately why somebody with let's say your personality or skills fits in that because i'm like great So um, but i'd love to know more about what you're interested in Um And then who knows who will meet along the way or what stories we can tell or oh for sure um so Uh, I don't know where to start.

22:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, okay, I think this is a good example. We will use this as a prop Uh, I've always thought that I wasn't productive enough Because you have so many ideas you cannot yeah, these ideas and you can really about it And I like systems.  like I like to create systems. I like to create systems more than I like to follow systems Yeah, we're like that too So one of the things I I'm always struggle like this table.  I'm talking to you from I built this table and it's funny because I need to make a series on that because it has evolved from like a workshop table with tools because I live in an apartment I was like this is my everything table and then so I like the physical I like physical things that help me be productive I'm really interested in that so you touch my nerve my nerve so I need to so physical things that help you you know think or produce things this is silly thing right I did it in 15 minutes it's like a habit tracker oh I love it with the rocker switches stupid yeah yeah yeah but I did it I don't use it every day I rarely use it but I love doing this sort of thing that is not there's no electronics it's just a box with so yeah this is like a pretty good high signal to to noise description of what I like my my most recent thing is like this  little tray for my index cards. this is house, this work, this admin. There's a magnet here so I can take the priorities and put them in.  And I made this yesterday, and I know that maybe I'll be 10 percent more productive, it was just not 10 percent, my 2 percent, but it was a pleasure to do this.  I need to make things with my hands every now and then. Yeah.

24:28 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm curious. Oh, I love I'm a book person. So I love when you look over and you go, oh, a book.  Hold up. So I'm curious. I don't know if you've ever done this for yourself. This is a great. It's it's from the Stanford Design School, which we're really lucky because it's about 12 kilometers that way.  Oh, we can go up to it very regularly and do this is a great little book.

24:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hmm.

25:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And I am curious, this isn't homework, I'm just asking you a question, wouldn't give homework, but I'm curious if you had a manifesto, what that manifesto would be.  Like I think I actually might already say to you, I have a handle on it. There's another, there's a guy I know in the UK who's a designer, his name is Alan Moore.  And he's an older guy, and he's got a website, is an OG Alan Moore.

25:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you mean by OG? Like he's been talking interesting things for a long, long time.

25:41 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And his business is, it's www.beautiful.business.

25:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it's all about beauty. And he's got this great little book again.

25:53 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And actually, this might be even more, that's why I thought of manifesto because it's Alan's, he's got this great little book.  It's called do build how to make and lead a business the world needs. Stop not sniping me.

26:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, sorry.

26:07 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Actually, what you do is just go on his website and click on the book tab. And there's a three minute video and it's all you need.  And what he does in the video is he's literally just reading from the introduction. And it's stunning. It's stunning.  It's the opening line. What does the world need? It's one of the most pressing questions of our time. Why?  Because this question encompasses a number of other questions. Why are we here? For what reason do we exist? What values create the foundation of what matters most?  What kind of world are we trying to make? We must transform our mindset, but to what end? And that's what the book is about.  And it's all about using design. And so I think that's why when I look at the kind of things you're putting out there, I'm going, oh, you're asking the same questions that Alan's asking.

26:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I knew of Alan. know about this thing and I yeah I need to get it.

27:03 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Alan's a good guy I know him pretty well so should you if you have a look at it and you like it let me know I can intro you to Alan.

27:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah I think I'll think I'll begin that process for sure.

27:17 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Yeah listen I know you need to go but let's definitely have a conversation.

27:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes you wanna so I have a longer scheduling link or we can just look at the calendar and try to pick it now or what's best for you.
