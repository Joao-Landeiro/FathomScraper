0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you? All right, good. Can you hear me? I can.

0:55 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I can hear you too. Thanks for taking the time. the feedback. No, I thank you.

1:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a funny moment because before you invited me, I was taking screenshots of everything I could see about your workshop as a benchmark to see how people sell their workshops.  I'd like this mural board of putting things in and it was like, oh, really good. I can share it with you of course.  So first, I told me you were alright. Good weekend. Managed to get some rest there.

1:44 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yeah, things are good. got family in town visiting so it's just kind of relaxing and spending time with family.  Nice.

1:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Lots of dating app. I moved a few months ago. And I think I'm at my last box here at the office.  I don't know about you. I have an office at my house, which is the mess room. And now we're down to the last box, which I'm very, very happy about that.  That's good.

2:18 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yeah.

2:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So thank you. Thank you for the invitation. Let's get to it. And also, congratulations on working it. I think most people, everybody, had a good experience, really.  And I thought it was pretty good.

2:30 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  this is my first formally paid one or ran a couple of pilots prior to. So what did you like the most about this one run?  Actually, I liked the smaller group, because my original plan was to max out of 10. I'm kind of happy that it ended up being a smaller group, I don't know.  Well, one of the pieces of feedback I got from Andrew afterwards, because I know him pretty well, he said that the a lot of the value came from kind of the one on one feedback that I was able to give to everybody.  And I don't think I'd be able to do that in a group of 10 where I'm jumping between groups.

3:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

3:20 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Because it would have to be broken out in like, you know, at least three groups for every working session.  So part of me is literally wondering, do I need to increase the price and then only limit it to five people or something.

3:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I also felt that one of the high points of it was like you thinking on your feet and like this very contextualized bias that, you know, signaled and show that you've been thinking about this with depth for a while.  And I think this is a common, also for myself, a common like tension, do I get more people in or do I give this deeper level of attention to the ones that are joined?  yeah. And it also feels to me, I don't know about you, but it also feels to me, think you have a bigger audience than I do, that there's a little bit of a chicken and egg thing, like you could get like a bigger group if the qualification is so good that everyone has kind of the same issues, but unless you have a massive audiences.

4:34 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So I've made a lot of notes.

4:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  made paper notes. like paper notes. do.

4:39 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  mine are different.

4:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I use I use a remarkable tablet, but I got to ask you about that.

4:44 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Oh, it's amazing. I can't I can't live without it because I also like handwriting notes. Like I'll do I use a note taker just for like backup.  I still take notes and meetings because I just find I memorize things better.

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  me think better and there's been you know studies that have proven that that's kind of how it works but I hated and I had stacks of notebooks I don't know that's you have now and you're like I don't know where anything is you're flipping through and that that part I hated it's so much better with a remarkable findability really takes a hit right yeah I know I have this I just don't know in which of these all seemingly looking pieces of paper yeah yeah exactly okay um um so should I get into it I'm I'm here perfect perfect so I've made like I did I did in my page in four sections one was about structure the other one was about facilitation the third one was about outcomes I didn't get to make much many notes on that because it seemed like it was pretty nailed down and the other one was what I called the full experience like getting the workbook and the whole environment around it right and I've highlighted a few but if you want to can  Later going to all of them. Yeah, let's see. Let's see. So this is the sequence I'll just list them and then maybe we dive into them.  Otherwise we won't. Yeah So workbook. really like the physicality of it question Just to know Did you think about the canvas?  Do you prefer a workbook? What's Maybe uh, when you say canvas, what do you mean? No, like the business model canvas this that's kind of thing Um, maybe maybe I do.

6:31 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  don't know I think it sounds familiar, but I'm not sure I know what you're What you're getting at Okay, so the workbook it takes people through a journey of putting in information and at the end they have something I think a canvas is a bit like a one-pager version of that like an Yeah, I mean I I I thought about my initial thought was Making it digital and using something like a mural board or something that people could do  But I just kind of, I don't think that way. Like I have a client that they really do everything in Miro and everything is zoom in, zoom in, zoom out.  I'm like, I can't , I can't do it. Like I do because they do it, but I don't like it.  So I don't know. It's just not my style. Like I like the idea of having something that, again, they can take notes on the presentation because inevitably something's going to come up.  And everything is contained versus if you just have this one cheater, you're kind of stuck with, I'm going to do this one cheater, but then I'm going take notes over here.

7:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if I do handwritten, I'm going to forget where they are. And then it's all gone.

7:39 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  And this kind of keeps everything contained. So that my idea. that was my thought. don't know if you otherwise let me know.

7:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, not to say is anything wrong. Because the way I thought about it was as a one pager. even maybe this could be like a section of your thing.

8:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  The spread so it's actually interestingly there will be because it's the what I don't know if I have it but pretty much what in my When I regroup with you guys the one-on-one session And the reason why I want all the notes So I'm in pretty much creating the one painter of like the three circles like the IP the go-to-market whatever And I'm taking what you put in with my plus my recommendations.  Okay. Here's what your IP should be Here's what you go to market should be here's your functional to be and then here's what you should like Let's talk about prioritization for each of those things about execute against them.  So there will be that Good.

8:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So that's it. Yeah So one thing that I think at some point you could have I know if I'm hitting the right turns here, but just, you know, correct mirror interrupting at some points  when you make, when you ask a question and towards the middle to the end is the stop being an issue because you framed the presentation in a different way but at the start I think it would have helped me to see the question on a slide just to leave the slide there while I'm thinking so I don't need to remember what you said right and I can, anyway this is an easy thing to think about.  I also think that when you get people to share a little bit of a story it's interesting and there was a little bit of these moments I think Andrew took and it feels like that's Andrew.

9:34 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  He's a talker I was like, I was this close to like interrupting him a couple of times because he was kind of hogging the thing and that's something I need to also be aware of is like maybe prep people like hey, try to keep it to, you know, more than a minute or two.

9:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, that's a pattern. There's different kinds of difficult participants and that's one specific kind of difficult. Really, really printed 11 spiral bound Cool Yeah, I'd like mine in black and white, but yeah, the color makes difference for sure.  Thank you for sure So I think that Something that it's really easy to to include it's Yeah, like a message from you like at the very start Message from you  Oh into the notebook itself.

11:02 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So what I usually do actually is when I send these, I send them with these like custom chocolate bars with like a card and I write a handwritten message.  It's nothing too crazy. It's a couple of sentences. So I do that. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

11:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So and what else? Oh, one thing that I think could could get the because the book is a companion to the presentation, right?  Yep. And it's in some ways it matches the presentation. So if I get to the most part, yeah. So if I get the book before the presentation, and I'm a curious person, I go through the book and I get a feeling of what's about to happen, right?  Which I think is interesting, but also could take away a little bit from the impact of like seeing it for the first time.  Yep.

11:54 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I've debated about that. So usually I try to time it where they get it, like no more than a day before.  before. Because the likelihood of somebody going through and spending an hour going through the workbook a day before the workup is not that high.

12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the problem happens is if something gets screwed up with shipping, they don't get it in time.

12:13 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So that's where I've thought about that too. this is where some of my questions and thoughts were like, okay, should I shorten the workshop by recording the presentation portion and they have to watch it before.  But then I'm like, that's not really personal. I don't know.

12:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a tough one to crack because it means adapting to different styles. some people will check it, some people will not check it.  And I think you're right by not recording it. I think maybe the idea like if the workbook would have more just like the exercises and less the exhibition aspect, exposition part.  Maybe you keep that punch because the exercise makes sense in the context of what you say, right? so Yeah, it's funny.

13:08 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I debated that right so I think my my first iteration of it had just the exercises But then I realized what I saw in the in my pilot workshops that people were taking notes Okay, well, I know exactly what's gonna happen with those notes.  They're never gonna look at them again because they're gonna disappear And that's where I decided am I okay? Well, I'm gonna Add in Like the core pieces and put a notes page so people can take their notes.  I mean, I'm curious.

13:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you take notes? I made notes. I I forgot I I didn't realize it took me a while I think it took me until minutes 27 or something.  Yeah to realize of oh each page is a Slime right I thought it was just the exercises and then for instance until page So I guess I mean that's a simple fix I could have said that like hey

14:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  just so you know the presentation for like the the workbook follows along with the presentations and then there's the exercise section.

14:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and also another thing you could do and I think this this it's a flexible way of doing it is just have large margins and then the people that will make notes they'll make notes on the margin for sure and the people that don't they don't but it does look like oh there's this whole space for notes and the person didn't use it and it feels weird like just like a thin column of text of content and then like maybe a third for space and then some people will make notes and relate to those to those things.  Okay so at some points you tell stories right stories from your life from your work yep at those points I think it would be interesting this is on the facilitation thing if you could put like a picture of like a younger you or  more at that time because I'm trying to fill in those those pieces of information like you tell me the story how it was maybe some years ago and I'm kind of trying to picture that but it could be like interesting and create a connection like oh yeah I see my mic is like as a different hairstyle or this picture looks that everybody's in 2010 or something.  This is also related to to the facilitation. I think the frameworks you have are really good and I think they would be easier to understand if you introduce them in piecemeal.  I can give you a very very...

15:42 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  you mean like introduce the framework then do the exercise then choose the next framework and then do the exercise?

15:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Even the elements of the framework so there's a page. So when you introduce the let's look at the ICP from the different angles.  there's a framework behind this right and I made this quick a quick sketch on my paper here maybe you can see it on the camera I don't know it's readable yeah I can see it it's like I can't see exactly what you're open I can I can see what you so there's a circle and different segments around it and you can use this as a bit of a way finding in the presentation so this is what we'll do and you show the whole thing now we're we're focusing on this segment and people okay so we're doing this segment and then you change the segment and you show it and people can see the relationship and they know like for all along they'll be talking about this oh so it's four perspectives into ICP got it this relatively easy to do I think and also another one that could be introduced in a different way is when you have oh yeah I found it the two by two yep and it was related to positioning right  So the two by two, there was a lot of depth to it because you thought a lot about this.  So suggestion, introduce the two by two and then have a different slide for each quadrant. So you fade everything else and you bring out the thing of that quadrant and you take people through that in the order that you have explained, right?  And at the end, you show the full thing.

17:28 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yep.

17:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this takes, I think, more slides, but that's not an issue. But then you make sure that everybody understands the same thing.  I mean, in the workbook, I would just keep the one slide, but then in the presentation, I could just animate it or just one pops.

17:43 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.

17:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also the viral journey, this one. This one I thought was really good, especially the aspect of the shortcuts, right?  And the exit points.

17:58 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So I'll introduce that first.

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  with a loop. This is what happens, and then you see the other loops, right? Because when I see it for the first time, it's like one, two, three, four, five, five stages, and each stage has like six, seven pieces, and it makes sense.  It seems rigorous, but just, oh wait, I need some time to Yeah, it's a lot to look at, yeah.  Yep. Makes sense. One of the things that I, so I think you really should keep the workbook for sure, but I think it creates a challenge which is like the people not talking too much because they're focusing on the book.

18:45 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  you feel this? Yeah, that's something that I have thought about a lot. I don't know that I have a good solution to because I know like on the one hand, there's an argument to be made for, well, do the like  Again consume some content to print do some work up front and the workshop is all Collaborative and everyone's talking all the time and sharing what they wrote on the flip side It's a lot like At least that it maybe this is just me thinking too much of myself.  I don't know but the Content that the frameworks that I present are not they're different than What's generally thought of as position it's not something I'm guessing it's anything you've seen before and With that like it I feel like it needs that personal kind of let me present it to you and really explain it Live in which case I can't do that right in which case they have to be there they have to listen to it And then they got a right so I don't know I don't know I don't have a good good solution to it Yeah, me neither.

19:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just like is it is a tension that comes with the with the format and I think is right.  I'm thinking like, maybe, I don't know, thinking out loud here, Maybe some like quick prompts, like go to questions that you can use to pepper a little bit of interaction from people, because the people, they get really, like some people don't like to think on their feet.  They like to have time to think and they wouldn't want to be bothered. Some others want to think and it's kind of a balancing act.  But overall, I mean, if this is the price to pay for having the workbook, just keep the workbook, it's just a thing.  Oh, another thing, I think this one is easy to implement and you might like it. You can signal people when you have a slide that they should screenshot.  I know that people will make notes, but if you nudge them towards the screenshot, I think you have more control of what things might end up on social media, right?  It's always interesting, in my opinion.

21:05 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Maybe you did this, I have no idea.

21:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's difficult to facilitate the workshop alone. But maybe make a list of things that people are mentioning, or use the transcript afterwards, I don't know, and especially in small groups.  Yet, like, oh, Cara mentioned these three things, and maybe after-action email I might mention it, or there's a book I'll recommend to Cara.

21:32 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yep.

21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And one way that's relatively easy to do that is you get a page, and you get some post-its, and you get a post-it for a person.  One person, post-it. And you make those little notes there.

21:44 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yep.

21:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you don't need much to impress people, build to, oh my god, you remember this thing. Right, right, right.

21:50 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yep, no, that's a good idea. So I did take notes of what people were saying, so I have it.  I didn't include that in my follow up, obviously, as you saw. Yeah, but I mean, I know this is quite a bit of work.

22:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  By coincidence, I also run like a similarly sized workshop on Friday. And it's, yeah, it's straight forward, you have notes, but it takes like into an maybe one and a half hours to send those emails and there's all that.  Yep. I really get it. Oh, this one I think is relatively easy to address, which is, when you're trying to ask questions, if people got it, I think that any questions, question?  I don't know.

22:47 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yeah. I should know better because I would train when I, we had a team at one point when I was running my agency and that was like the first thing like don't ever ask a client.  Do you have any questions?

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so you can have like pointed questions. Yeah, yes, that's a good reminder Is it or mosey that said we are remind reminded more often than we actually learn new things.  Yeah The follow-up session I thought it was a great idea Also The bit about functional not bit like the section about functional differentiation.  I think it was like Too dense for the time because it's really important And it then it feels a bit like oh Actually, I'm bit of two minds about this because it's interesting when people feel like I wish I had more Yeah, I wanted no more.

23:41 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So it's good.

23:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's interesting but also I Don't know it felt like oh, this is this like a big kind of worms that he needs it on its own time to process And I need like to think You bring that up and let me ask you this because I've been going back and forth of what was working on my

24:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  my business coach and she brought this up and then I've gotten feedback for and against this. So I haven't made the change.  But like, and also like, I felt rushed a bit. Like I don't know how, but the ICP section took longer than it has in the past.  And I felt like I was rushed and I had to rush people more in the following sections after that.  So one of the things I've thought about is rather than doing a single workshop is doing it as a cohort than doing like three, one, I guess four, four sessions, three, one and a half hour ones where it would be ICP risk and then differentiation.  So those three sessions and it'd be separate and it'd one a week. And an hour and a half would be longer than what we spent here.  But that's also where I would probably need to record the presentation portion up front. And that's where I was like, I don't know that I want to do that.  So, I don't know, but there's something what you're saying around some of the content is too dense and should have more time dedicated to it.  And also, again, like, if I think about, all right, if I want to keep it small and I want to keep it only up to five people and I do this and I want to charge doubles instead of 1200, it's 2400, you know, then almost doing it like a cohort and having follow-up homework for each almost kind of justifies that kind of format more than a singular four hour, I don't know, that's kind of all those things are.

25:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's like a web of things, right? We have to pull this lever in it. So my thinking on that, it's from a scheduling perspective, I think it's easier to say yes to a bunch of smaller workshops.  Yeah, I actually, I suggested your workshop to someone because she was. Telling me about some some challenges and I thought mmm.  I think I think I have like the right person for this Is Lisa and I sent her the the page for the language for the workshop and she couldn't do it for the schedule No, no problem.  She couldn't do it for the schedule. I have no idea because I was like I'll be attending the workshop But yeah, there's no commission.

26:21 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  There's not nothing like that.

26:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think it's useful for you So I don't know I didn't collect feedback on why it didn't fit their schedule Yeah, but I do get a feeling like four hours straight is is it's harder to make work?

26:34 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I was so the original one was Two and a half and I realized there's just no no way I can get all that done in two and a half Extended to three and I'm like even three is not enough.  I'm like this hat like and I I kept going like this has to be At least four hours and then even this time around it was almost four and half Right which would that kind of takes you to three one and a half hour sessions, especially if you can if I can pull out the  And maybe I do the, maybe it's, maybe it's five total sessions, right? So like the first week is, well no, I actually know, because if I do separate sessions and I have to split up the presentation, it's 15 minutes of presentation, and then we go into the exercises.

27:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then you have homework.

27:21 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  When they come back, it's 15 minutes of presentation, exercises, homework. 15 minutes of presentation, exercises, homework, follow up one-on-one session.  So it's four minutes of one. So I thought about doing it that way.

27:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's an interesting thing to ponder because it's nice to have the finality of four hours, solve these in four hours, it's powerful, but I think that it's a lever to play with a little bit.  But so you've asked me about, you said, oh, I had this question because of when I've mentioned the functional differentiation being like a big, I got the feeling that you were going to ask me a question, but I'm not sure I got the question.

28:11 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  tell me about, let me pull up the workbook. trying to remember what's so dense about it. GTM, IP, functional, okay.  See that specifically that the functional one was too dense? Or just that entire differentiation section was very dense.

28:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Point, let me take a look here.

28:40 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Because it is, there are three prompts for every single one.

28:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, maybe the whole differentiation thing. Okay. Maybe the whole differentiation thing. There's also another thing that it's a lever it can use.  is the more time, the more space you give people to write things the more time they think they'll need, right?  So simple example, if I give people like 10 post-its and I tell them you don't have to use the 10 post-its, they'll try to use eight.  But if I give them three post-its, they'll just use the three post-its and it just goes, you just compress time.  Because sometimes you have like these really quick people, but they do the whole thing really fast and then get my point.  you get whatever there, or a knob there, which is adjusting the time, the amount of space. And there was another thing, which I think was also relatively...  Okay, so for instance, this is my notes on what type of organizations you get the most referrals, what type of organizations most...

30:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  important.

30:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of things that I've noticed is that at some points like I'm answering your question, Yep. And then you have this prompt for helping me explore which I think is a good idea to do thing.  And then I got this like note for myself like, oh, there's a pattern that I'm seeing. So it could be useful to check it with other people.  But maybe it's either um, the why question, you can ask, like, what, what other conclusions do you do you arrive at?  Because why is a powerful question, right? And then you have, there's, there's two levels to this. But there's a question.  There's help to explore the answer, which is the why. And maybe, like my confidence level in this is not absolute.  Maybe there's a third level for some which is like, see Utilizing that right so I'll give you an example your question was what type of organizations do your people most?  enjoy working with right I'm One man back. Yep, so I said they can explore so clients can explore but at the sense of urgency they want to ship stuff and that's all and Then I said and then there's a question of why why do I enjoy working with this mess?  Is it the people the architecture the unique problems I? Said well the flat fee helps you know working with speedy people The more working together and less therapy is also is also good, right?  So this is the why and then I thought oh maybe the pattern is People that have showed up on a podcast because they they are organized about this Maybe my conclusion is not a good one, right?  Yeah, don't take this to seriously. It's just something that came to me like The idea that you have the pattern that you have of asking a question and helping people think about that question It's really good.  Yeah.

32:06 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  No, it's it's a good. It's a good piece of feedback because I've heard this from At least a few there's one of the things that I was advised to do is at the very end There's been a couple times I've also ran these like dedicated ones for individual companies I'm done a few of those are paid those I've done three or four times now and It's actually the majority of the time and I still fixed it and they probably should The ending is a bit flat like the ending to the workshop and they kind of leaves them going Like they were excited like lots of stuff and they got tired because it's a lot of stuff And then they go they're almost like hoping for like a pick-me-up like raw raw thing and it's like alright thanks everybody see and then we go and One of the things that Somebody recommended to me is like before you wrap up Ask like hey, what was the one?  Or take away or one core insight that you got out of this that you're gonna really follow up on or something like that Just get people to kind of Get excited about what they learned again and create some accountability that kind of thing.  Yes.

33:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes I think that yeah closing down the workshop. It's it's easy to To miss the energy on that Everybody's tired.  You're tired. You're like you're the most tired person.

33:24 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  That was that was the other reason why I've been debating about Changing to one and a half hour multiple once because I'm finding like by the time I get to hour number four I'm just like, okay, I Gotta, you know myself going here.  Yeah.

33:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and I didn't feel that but I know that It wasn't visible that you were like, sorry, but yeah closing down the workshop.  I think it's And one thing that I think it's it's relatively easy to close down the workshop is like a generators anticipation, right?  One of the things that you've mentioned Earlier in our conversation today when I said, oh, what about the canvas or like a one-pager, you know, and then you told me Yeah, we'll do that.  So if you at the end of the workshop for the screenshot of that, this is what we'll do Together Maybe people can get that feeling or you can even like get sneaky on that and blur out some parts Right.  Oh, I really want to know what Mike will do with this, you know stuff like that And This thing that I'm about to say is also difficult for me I've only recently got this pointed out to me, but I think makes sense Which is like kind of abruptly abruptly Finish it like you recap State the value of these things we've learned the stuff will do this thing was great having you guys Chow and it just hands on a on a high note.  Yep, but Yeah We're not great at this, sharing a lot of stories. Yep, yep. Oh, sorry, I think I've been bombarding you.  Maybe you have specific questions. No, that's good.

35:10 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I'm just, I'm taking notes, so.

35:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One of the things that, so one of the things I like about the book is that people find the book later, right?  It's something that they have, and then they find it later. And I think this is an hypothesis on my side, right?  If the book were like physically smaller, maybe people would keep it around for longer.

35:39 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I thought about that. I actually thought about making it half the size originally. I just hadn't figured out the whole printing side and whatever.

35:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I did think about that. Yeah, I mean, just it's, because I feel like having this on. on the top of the page and then I'm done with it and I just, the way I store something that looks like this is different from the way I store something like this, right?  And well that's the thing and also it probably makes shipping cheaper and I don't know what possibly.

36:25 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Oh, final thing, sorry.

36:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When people get the thing, when the people get the workbook, maybe you could have like some prompt that is really easy to say yes to on the workbook.  Like people receive it and they immediately put something on it, right? Like a silly example would be their name, I don't think it's the best example, right?  But oh, can you write what you were thinking about when you signed up for this or something that initiates the act of using the workbook, right?  And You could also put, I think there's two ways about this. One way is with a prompt of something that they actually do to the workbook, like put your name here, put your name here.  And the other thing is like giving them a prompt for things to think about before the session. So when they're taking a shot, they think, yeah, yeah, Mike, yeah, I should think about this now.  And by the time they arrive at the session, they've been thinking about this for a while. And of course they have been thinking about this because they signed up and they got emails, of course.  But it's just another nudge towards making the workbook part of their conscience. know, like, oh yeah, there's the book, yeah, sure.  That kind of thing. Or also like send you a picture of the book when they got it, because this also gives you, you know, content for social media or stuff like that.  Yeah, You can also put like at the end of the workbook, like a feedback form that people could fill in really quickly and then they send you a picture of that.  Because it's easy to say yes to them. Right.

37:59 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Something like I like that.

38:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You could have, like, just, no, you could have each section. You could have, like, a very quick, like, scale, something like this.  And you ask people, what did you think about the section and the markets, right? Because this also invites them to reflect about what they went through.  And when you ask them for feedback, they can go back to it and, you know, the more you can make them interact with the book, with the book, I think the best.  the easier it is, the easier you make it, the easier, the more they will.

38:48 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Yep.

38:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's it, Mike. mean, some things that I think you did really well, I think thinking on your feet, making, like, point and scale.  suggestion for people adapting the time. think I think you did that really well. You've, there was no, I made the note at the start, but then you're correct, not correct, it's just like you addressed that later, which was you used your own visual frameworks.  I think the fact that you're leaning to that, that you really said, look, for me writing is important and I think it conveys a different thing.  I really believe in this because, to give an example, so I'm posting content on LinkedIn, right? And maybe I'm  at making content, don't know, but thank you, but I mean the reach is a bit small, LinkedIn.  Yeah, that's LinkedIn now.

40:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  My reach isn't that great either, so it's hard to, you know. Yeah, and well, thank you for saying that.

40:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But also what I've been thinking, like I'm going to start to send like handwritten notes, like really specific to people.  You know, and I think we're entering that stage of expertise businesses. this was not just a mural, right? There was a workbook and like you make notes, even the fact that I didn't know you had the remarkable.  Maybe you spoke about this at some point. I didn't know. But I think it's also, it builds that, you know, that image of like you care.  Texture is, I think, is a thing of luxury. Like, yeah, when you buy like luxury goods, they always have like attention to texture.  it is it great, but is a decision, right? So I think things that exist in the physical world, they carry a certain gravitas.  And I think you're doing a good thing with that. Um. And leaning into that, one thing that maybe works, okay, I don't know, is if you have the workbook and then you have like maybe a smaller thing, I'm a designer by training so I always like doing things, but I have like, I mentioned like maybe a branded index cards, right?  And then on the book, it says right here, like three commitments you'll keep and put this in your wallet.

41:36 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  So more things that will pop up in people's daily lives to remind them of you, right?

41:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This could be stickers for the computer brand, it depends on your ICP, this could be like...

41:50 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I mean I have a bunch of swag that I got to use anyway, like that's why I send like the chocolates.  We do have stickers I think still. Um, but I like the card idea, though.

42:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I mean, that's what I have. Thank you so much. I mean, this was really flatter when you said the message.

42:13 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  thanks for that.

42:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I thought that it was, let me think like I have my own notes for like as a participant, like things that you've made me think about my own positioning thing.  And that was like very specific directions that I got from it, you know, like, um. For instance, these are notes I got from going through the workshop as a participant, right?  And fractionals via market for facilitation, right? As fractionals, they are used to work with a lot of context because they are inside of companies, but now they don't have that context.  They need to get that context really quickly. Workshops are good for this. Good. I think you said this so boutique is already high risk make it high rewards or something like that.  I was like, okay It's a good thing Yeah, your functional IP go to market. I think it's also great.  I Replicate replicated the framework on that Wait when you when you suggest it to consider margin as a way to go out financial perform performance Okay, it's interesting to know like the metrics yep of my ICP how they think about things this is good stuff What would I change in approach if my ICP or people IQ like marketers of Professional services firms like you what what should I be doing differently?  was like, okay. Yes, you're open stuff Also Like questions I asked myself, about expanding it be always a risky proposition, but you know  You know, including roles and responsibilities on my proposal, so people expect how they would be involved in things. So I got things from this, also, these are like the non-workbook things, right?  The other stuff is in their book. So I think it was a good workshop, useful, and I also got me a little bit of that, oh my God, I got so much to do, which I think is a good sign, right?  I think that's a good symptom.

44:32 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I mean, I think so. You know, I think it could go, this is where I'm not sure it could go either way, where it's like if there's too much, depending on you a person here, you might get overwhelmed and do nothing.  On the flip side, if all it is just confirms the things that you've been doing, you're like, eh, do I really need to pay for that?  Right, it's one of those things, so.

44:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's a, apologies, I'm interrupting you, go ahead. There's a thing that I found really interesting. the Maya most advanced yet acceptable and so the principle it's easy to remember easy to understand right so you don't want to stay within like oh yeah I knew this but you want people to not feel completely in a foreign land right so it's a difficult mix but I think it's a good direction to point right it's advanced right within and I don't know maybe this is what happens on your on your follow-up session but helping people prioritize it's really important so maybe that yeah that's definitely part of it in terms of like okay here's the here's your one cheater here's what it looks like and now let's put a plan together of where do you need to focus the most energy right because some people like they're you know I work with clients where they already have their IP fairly well developed and they just don't have good content to evangelize it so now we go in the we really focus on go to market and fit in and also sometimes they don't they have the

46:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  but they don't actually use it in their delivery. Okay, so let's work through, how do we operationalize this in your delivery so you're always connecting the dots, you know?  It really gets back to those things. So yes, the one-on-one is definitely meant to do some of that.

46:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And again, you could tie this in with like at the end of the workshop, you might the rest is like, for some of you maybe you have a lot of things you're like filling with overwhelm, worry not, I'll help you prioritize this.  And then people are, oh, okay, okay. So I know exactly the value. yeah. It's clear that there's value in a follow-up session, but there's, it could be so many different things.  And this is like one type of thing that would be valid. Yep. Okay, that's it, that's it. That's great.

46:55 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Thank you.

46:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, thank you. That's helpful.

46:56 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I got a whole page of notes.

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  On your remarkable. Is it the first version the second version?

47:04 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  This is the No, I don't remember. I think it's the first one Okay, or Yeah, it's the first one.  It's not not the color one the color one But you use it every day. Yeah every day I Need I need to get my hands on it's uh, you know I debated about it for a long time and they're finally my wife got it for me for my birthday like Four years ago or something like that three years ago, and I like I've never been nations I've never been happier, but like it's it it makes a huge difference Because it's just so much easier to find stuff because your notes are organized.  Yes. Yes Yeah, I find ability.

47:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, yeah, I use like obsidian and then sometimes I take the time to translate these things into I mean if you get like a visa week, and it's also a bad way of spending time for sure Right, so yeah, really really thinking about that.  Yep. Yep. Well, it's yeah

48:00 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  thing I like about it is it's it's again it seems expensive I don't spend $400 on a notebook that's nuts but there's also what I find is like the value of just being able to go and whatever sit outside or at a coffee shop without any distraction because this thing it has Wi-Fi but it can't to the internet there's there's there's no browser so the only thing you can do is write yeah draw or whatever right so this creates this environment where you can kind of anywhere go and just be heads down and doing stuff just like you over the notebook right and how does it all do is I'll bring my phone because you know you always need to reference some things usually not my phone with me but you know you're not going to do too much like as long as you're writing you're not going to go and get too distracted with your phone yeah and I you know I'll that way nice yeah I should I should should try

49:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I recommend it. I think it's totally worth it.

49:05 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Well, don't forget to sign up for your one-on-one, because you do still get that.

49:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I need to do the homework. And also, okay, final thing. Homework is a great concept, but the name, maybe there's something you can do about the name.  I don't know. I don't have suggestions.

49:25 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  I'm sure you're aware of this. I thought about it, because homework could be demeaning and whatever.

49:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but it's something I just asked Chech APT and you. Yeah. Anyway, okay, okay, I'll stop being annoying. Thank you so much, Mike.  No, this is good. you. I'll stay in touch and... Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'll do it.

49:46 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
  Thank you. Awesome. Have a nice one.

49:48 - Mike Grinberg (proofpoint.marketing)
