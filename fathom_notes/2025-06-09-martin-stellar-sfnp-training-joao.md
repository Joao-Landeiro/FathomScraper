0:00 - Martin Stellar
  Good day.

0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How have been? Good, good.

0:04 - Martin Stellar
  And you? This meeting is being recorded. Very good. I spent the weekend mentoring at a hackathon, which was exhausting, but fun.

0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  New insights?

0:19 - Martin Stellar
  I'm judgmental. Also, I'm eye candy. I was literally told that. That's a first. No, but just a really good experience.

0:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are you from Malaga right now?

0:43 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, I am. At my friend's place. This is organized by tech stars, and a couple of friends organized it twice a year.  This is my second round as a mentor. And the insight is that we make these people...

1:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're just walking around answering questions, having a coffee, smoking a cigarette, and these people are sitting there taking it so  serious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:10 - Martin Stellar
  It struck off so much. It was really impressive.

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if you want to be malicious, it's just float around and contradict the past mentor. People get really like, don't know.  The other guy said we should go all in on ads. Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:28 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, I know.

1:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hilarious.

1:31 - Martin Stellar
  Anyway.

1:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, sorry, interrupted you.

1:36 - Martin Stellar
  That's good. We're here for you.

1:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, okay, I remember. So I was wondering if we can change the time slots for the next couple of weeks because I'll be traveling.  Is that a possibility?

1:52 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. What is going to work for you?

1:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's see. Let's Let's I always have a standard weekly meeting and then adjust on a week-by-week basis as needed.

2:07 - Martin Stellar
  What is easiest for you? Or we can skip a week if that is going to be easier, whatever you prefer.

2:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, that might be the best idea for the 23rd of June and the 30th of June.

2:26 - Martin Stellar
  Okay.

2:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Other than that, actually, the other ones, I think, are okay as they are. I can do the next one.  So, yeah, it's good.

2:38 - Martin Stellar
  It's good.

2:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

2:40 - Martin Stellar
  Then there's only one.

2:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's only on the 16th and the – not the 16th, apologies. I'm being confused. On the 23rd and on the 30th.

2:55 - Martin Stellar
  Yes. Those are removed. The only problem. the problem. It's This is that by so many weeks without contact that you're going to get engaged and disconnect and lose the process.  So as much as you can, show up in Slack, talk to me, keep this conversation going. Because there's a lot of noodling that people do behind the scenes outside of the sessions.  And if I can input things, if I can course correct, if I can participate in your conversation, that'll be much more helpful than if you just completely disappear for two weeks.  Got it. Last week you sent me this question and I went back to you saying, ah, interview. But I haven't heard from you yet.  And so stay with me. Stay in the process because it's going to increase, it's going to accumulate its effect over time.  And if you disconnect too much, it's going to be hard to see the sense in how it all works.  That's a bit of a function of the long-term and ambiguous nature of the process.

4:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Okay, so this is a valuable correction. Okay. So you think I'm probably being, I'm under communicating on Slack?

4:15 - Martin Stellar
  Well, like I said, I discovered that I'm judgmental. So it's not the word that I would use.

4:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But if I have access... No, I'm taking this as just like, in your experience, people tend to use Slack more than I do?

4:27 - Martin Stellar
  Some do, some don't.

4:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the people who regularly show up once a day, twice a day, four times a week, those are the people who get the most out of the program.  Got it. Makes sense. Okay.

4:38 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Good. So tell me about your week, briefly.

4:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me open the agenda. Okay. So I got into a couple of conversations. So into got into a couple I got into week.  You Some of them were really good, and others, so I scheduled a few, and some of them fell into last week already, which was great.  And I also asked some friends to connect me with people, so that was good as well. And I spoke to, I think, three groups of, three different kinds of people, I would say.  So one was, and I think this is very important to me, which is to really bucket this stuff into different, be aware that not all conversations are the same.  And so one was kind of an established independent consultant guy, been doing it for nine years. All the hallmarks of hyper-curious person, not super marketing-focused, you know, intrigued, but probably struggles with directing their focus into keeping up with the stuff.  So really identified with the guy. But he's been doing this for nine years. So right now it's like a network and the thing has a certain inertia to it.  The other one was a guy, this was perfect. This was a guy that helps experts translate their ideas into books.  He's written books. He did marketing for financial services. So selling the invisible kind of thing. And that was also very useful because this guy runs workshops.  This guy has been running workshops for 10 years and he really got it. So it was like a look at how people that have adopted workshops and do this kind of intangible work, see them as high bandwidth, high touch, premium experiences.  He shared a little bit of the... Prices he charges and how he frames it, so it was great, and I think we have an open channel.  was a really good conversation. And the other one was, oh, sorry, the other one didn't happen yet. It's going to happen today, which is that guy that wrote the book, Team Topologies.  I know you're a nerd, but I don't know if you are in this world, but it's kind of a big deal in the DevOps thing.

7:25 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, I've not read it. I am a nerd, but that one is new to me.

7:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so like in startups and stuff like that, it's like a big deal. So for this guy, the conversation is a little bit more about the metagame of turning your ideas famous.  And I have a few others lined up for this. I think I followed your idea with a spreadsheet. created my own questions.  But I could only really... really... So then for the first guy, the guy that had been running the independent thing for nine years, the other ones were, it's really a constant effort of pulling back into, oh, I'm trying to learn about this, I'm trying to learn about this.  Because conversations are, they have a life of their own.

8:21 - Martin Stellar
  And you don't like to focus?

8:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't like to miss the opportunity to jump into interesting conversations. Or figuring out cool things. That's a thing.

8:36 - Martin Stellar
  But your win is going to come from deep focus.

8:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

8:41 - Martin Stellar
  obsessive focus on one special thing.

8:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I'm aware of that. And I understand the architecture of that. It's just very annoying. But, yeah, I mean, anyway, all of these things are about the transformation.  So another thing that was very useful was I started talking to Billy Bross, which is the marketing guy behind Tiago Forte from Building a Second Brain.

9:12 - Martin Stellar
  Yes.

9:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And he has this book, Simple Marketing for Smart People. And I got it and I read it in like one evening.  It's a short book. Very nice. I think you might find the book interesting as well. And then I was, I went also, I started also to read the Selling the Invisible, which is, I think is an older book.  And I think just by osmosis, because all the books I've been reading are about sales, like for the past month or so.  Different kinds of sales or marketing or selling services, stuff like this. So what's getting more and more clear, not just intellectually, but almost becoming instinctive is.  what's what's getting getting what's what's So So getting How you need to step out of the expertise and connect to where people are, meet where people are, right?  And how they look at things and the kind of language they use and stuff like that. So that's it.  I've also finished some work for a client, setting up a workshop for them. Quick thing, there were previous clients, it's the third thing they buy from me.  Maybe there's some interesting analysis to do there. Yeah, I think these are the main news.

10:46 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Okay, good. So let me show you the... Let's So we've talked about how everything hinges on listening and learning people and figuring out what they really mean and what they're trying to tell you and what they're not telling you.  There's going to come a point where they say, well, how would you do this? How are you going to solve this?  Yeah, but explain what's in the tin. And what most people at that point do is fall into the hype trap where I show you what we've got and how it works in the implementation and then start to try and pitch.  The whole concept of ethical selling, so for nice people, is that you don't do any pitching. Pitching is lame and it's annoying and it's frustrating and it is in effect inherently dysfunctional.  Pitching is functional. The problem with the pitch is that no matter how good your slide deck and how well-researched and AI-optimized your story and calibrated to the target demographic, you might be one degree off and think that you're going to land in Boston, but you end up in Florida.  Because in you trying to get your message across, you have to be so accurate that you have to speak their language.  Now, you can never achieve that because you are not that person. That's why pitching is exactly the opposite of how we operate.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/CZE_m6JpN3XYdNcuMsYTrYRWvay4wy8H?timestamp=761.386914  Instead, we simply explain. And explaining is so much fun. Normally, what we try to do is we tell our buyer about our better master.  This is how it works. This is how we can do it. The truth is, people don't give a damn about your better master.  They just want to know if they can get rid, if you can get rid for them of that damn mouse infestation.  . So instead of trying to pitch something and convince people, we're going to make it very easy and very simple for people to self-select.  So in the explain mode, or the explain pillar, rather, of the system, you're simply going to outline what they can expect and what they cannot expect.  The parameters, the operator that you use, is you want to achieve, you want to get people to trust you enough to let you talk and explain more and more, and ultimately buy from you.  The way to do that is the archetype of the trusted advisor, which sounds very fright and hypey and it's been abused, but if you do it right, you actually become somebody who advises them.  And they trust you. The driver of it is honesty and the pitfall is hype. The action that you're taking is your make.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/CZE_m6JpN3XYdNcuMsYTrYRWvay4wy8H?timestamp=843.71875  And easy for people to self-select. It goes like this. So in this explain. You are operating as the advisor.  Yeah. You're going to tell people what they can expect, what is in the tin. What is not in the tin, so what offer includes and does not include.  And who it is for. No, it is not for. Very simple. Very pleasant. Very factual. It's like a spec sheet of a service or the different types of appliance that you can buy.  This one does have a freezer. That one does not have a freezer. If you want a freezer, don't buy this one, but buy the other one.  So there is no typing. There's no challenging. There is no trying to convince anybody. It's simply you inspect this.  You do not expect that. that. And it does not. For you, if you want this or if you want that.  Does that work? Like I said, when you try to pitch and convince people, and you are off by just a margin of error, your buyer is going to lean in.  And the sales process is an ongoing dance of trying to find an overlapping vision for you and your buyer to both have the same idea of whether this would be a good idea or not.  Because the truth is, your buyer is not the only one doing the vetting. You need to vet your buyers as well.  This is very important because the moment you start landing the wrong kind of buyers, you are paying a high cost.  You know, you're getting the money, you're getting the gig, it's very nice. But you also have to deal with a micromanager or somebody who is not putting in hours or isn't providing the information that you need.  So you need to be as careful in selecting your buyer. And that is why the is for and not for conversation is so important.  You want to make it easy for people to see themselves as benefiting from that outcome. Being themselves, not adopting your vision of the before and after.  You want people to develop their own vision of the outcome. The second problem with pitching is that it presumes that people are going to be interested in how much you know.  Oh, let me tell you that I've done this thing and I can do that stuff and I've used these models and I've had that training and I have an accreditation and they don't give a damn.  Again, they just want to know that you can solve their problem. Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.  And that's where the mechanism comes. When you explain what is in the tin and what is not in the tin and who it is for and not for.  They suddenly start to feel at ease. You will see people's shoulders drop. You will see them relax. You will see them lean in.  Because the problem with a lot of sales conversations is that there is inherent uncomfortable tension. Because he's going to want me to buy something, and I have all kinds of questions, but I cannot ask them because I'm being bombarded with words and slides.  And so I hope I'm going to make the right decision. Maybe I shouldn't make a decision today so that uncomfortable feeling that exists, that tension, gets resolved by being very clear and open about what is in the tin and what is not in the tin.  What is for and not for and if it's all for you, then go away. That's fine. And we can connect again in a few months.  So you want to be comfortable with the discomfort of not trying to convince anybody with your pitching. I don't know how you operate when you talk to buyers.  But a lot of people will automatically fall into that trap to go and explain, to try and be persuasive.  Persuasiveness is just code for making people wrong. Let me show you how your thinking is wrong, because once you see my point of view, then you're going to want what I have.  Oh, you want people to develop their own vision, and it is your job to assist them in developing that vision.  Another problem with pitching is that it is typical salespeople behavior. We expect someone to show, like I was working with a partner a few months ago, and he was going to talk to a government official in the UK.  He's like, okay, this is what I have, this is my pitch. So seriously, you're going to show up to somebody who is very busy, and the first 90 seconds, you're going to claim that and waste that with a whole record of what you've done and who you've worked for.  Don't waste somebody's time. Just show up. And start asking them questions. The consequence is that this guy wanted to work with my partner.  Simply because of a very different approach than what you expect from a salesperson or from anybody selling things. If you show up looking like a salesperson, if it looks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck.  Quacks like a duck. And if you show up behaving like a salesperson, well, that's got to be a salesperson.  And what do you do with salespeople? We ignore them. Because they're trying to get something from it. So we are going to show up in a way that is completely unexpected and far remote from what typical salespeople do.  There's also the problem that the more you try to convince them, persuade people, the more they're going to dig in their heels.  Because of that, you're wrong. Let me explain better. So this a few years ago in Lisbon, I was looking for properties.  explain And I was shown something very nice, but it wasn't for me. It was too boxy. It had no tariffs.  You know, I said, want something with the tariffs. And the real estate lady was like, yeah, well, then there are shops all around, and there's public transportation.  And look at the view. You've got the university campus behind you, and it's wonderful. Yeah, but, you know, it's not going to be for me.  And the more I withdrew, the harder she leaned in, and her voice went up, and she started getting tense.  And please, please let me just finish my story, and please like what I have to say. So the harder she tried, the more I felt resentment and a feeling of, get me the hell out of here.  That's the typical salesperson approach.

20:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I live in Brazil. I have no idea how much training I have with dealing with that. Salespeople are relentless.  So, yeah, I know what you mean.

20:48 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah. Now, the moment you do the things that salespeople do, you're going to get the action that salespeople get.  And this is why salespeople have to have such a tough skin, a thick skin. And I have to be so tough and be able to withstand all the rejection.  And yes, ultimately, selling is a process of counting no's until you get to a yes. That is the same for a salesperson and for an ethical seller.  But how do you want to get your no's? Do you want to hear the implicit no of I'll think about it and I'll let you know?  Or do you want the explicit no saying it sounds good, but it's not for us? The second one is much nicer because then you know where you stand.  And they will feel respected and treated well. And they'll be open to you connecting with them again in the future.  Another reason why explaining is so important in a very sober-minded way where there is no hype, there is no pitching, you're not trying to convince anybody.  It's the fact, you know, this is what's in the tin, this is what is not in the tin. Very, very cut and dry, very sober-minded.  choice keeping you're., that Any would sell сдел didn't from is That when you present the facts instead of the hype, you're making people think.  So, as you'll remember, everything starts with questions, and questions are the answer to everything. When you ask better questions, you trigger a thought process in people.  Higher the quality of your questions, and coaching and therapy does this very nicely, the more you enable people to figure out their own way forward and their own decision.  Explaining does the same thing. If you want a service that includes this, then it's going to enable that. But if you also want to include SEO, that is not going to be part of the deal.  We don't provide that, or that's not part of this package. We're just taking something out. And now this person is going to ask themselves, well, do we want the SEO with it?  Because then maybe, or maybe we can do without the SEO. We don't have to look for a different provider.  So you start, you. They start a triage process on their thoughts, creating clarity. And that clarity is really important because you cannot make a decision unless you have clarity.  So your process of first asking questions and having them think and then having that very simple super-minded explanation of what it is and what it is not enables that buyer to get clarity on what is the solution for the problem and is the problem big enough to solve and is it something that should be solved now?  So everything comes down to facilitating a better thought process and selection of what really matters for a buyer so that they become the authority and the autonomy in the process and they get to make their own decision.  You can tell buyers until you're blue in the face how important it is to solve the problem, but it's not until they agree that they're going to solve that.  The easiest way to get them to agree is to have them decide for themselves instead of trying to tell them it's good for them.  When you then have the courage and the composure to enable people to walk away, to tell them if you want this or if you're this kind of client, you want to be in control of the process, you want to micromanage, therefore it is not for you and it is fine if you tell me no.  Now, again, you're doing the opposite of what a salesperson does. A salesperson tries to get you to yes. We say, yes, no, I don't care, whatever is the best decision for you.  And that feels very comforting because here is now somebody who is advising me on what is actually the best decision according to me.  I trust this person. I like this. This feels good. Both of that whole process, you are doing the opposite of what salespeople do, where a salespeople typically implicitly tells the other person, you're not the autonomy, the authority in this process.  I know it's best for you. There's an arrogance in that, but it is also fundamentally wrong, because every person is a world unto themselves, and the owner and lord of their own.  Or else, people make their own decisions. When you show up trying to convince people that this is the right decision, or that is the right decision, apparently you are now their boss telling them what is right for them.  Watch people dig in their heels and reject the process, simply because they sense on a subconscious level that somebody's telling them what's good for them.  Now, this is what you can get. This is not what you can get. This is it's for, and this is what it's not for.  Any questions? And now, your conversation comes Now your buyer gets clarity. Now your buyer starts asking you really relevant explanation questions, and then you can continue the explanation, again, in a very simple, sober-minded way.  Second thing, the next thing that happens, when you start telling people what is not in the tin and who it is not for, they are going to tell you their objections.  You're going to reveal the buy blockers. Normally in the sales process, you end up sending the proposal, and then they're going to come back and say, yeah, well, there's this problem, there's that objection in the way, and now you have to do objection handling.  Fun. But there's books out there written by salespeople with shiny ties that tell you the 12 different ways to handle objections.  So after the whole process, and after negotiating the terms, and after writing the proposal, which is seven pages, which you have to, you now have to also go and do objection handling.  Thank And they've already basically indicated it's going to be a no because of this objection and that objection. We want to get those objections out in the open, on the table, up for discussion as early as possible.  I don't know if I've told you, but sometimes I will talk to a buyer and within the first 20 minutes I'll go, it's probably a $20,000 to $50,000 project.  Is that going to be a problem? So that's before I even know the scope of the problem. That's before I know any details.  This is my first triage goal. And I go, the biggest objection that we typically get is price. We're looking at a very complex, very intractable problem to solve.  It's going to be a lot of mental real estate. And $20,000 to $50,000 is probably the bracket that you're looking at.  Is that going to be an objection? If that is an objection, then I know that from the very first moment.  And I can then either help my buyer to overcome that objection by changing the scope or spacing. Payments, or whatever is needed to make it possible for them to part with the money, instead of having to run into that objection in the end and having to overcome it.  So where Hyping says to a buyer, this is what we have and this is what is good for you and this is what you need, we simply explain what is and it is not, and we enable the buyer to choose for themselves.  We have people self-select, people like that very much. It's bad as they explain better.

  Can you bring up the visual again?

28:48 - Martin Stellar
  This one?

28:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, this one. Listen, explain, ask. I love So in between the intersection of listen and explain, smiley face, what is that?  I don't remember.

29:09 - Martin Stellar
  Yes. Oh, this is, well, I don't like it. I don't like sounding. And we're going to take that into this ain't so bad and enjoy this.

29:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay.

29:26 - Martin Stellar
  And once you figure out how to have those conversations, when you base everything on questions, it actually does become quite nice to have sales conversations.  Because you're now involved in a process that is much closer to coaching or therapy than to selling. In the end, coaching, therapy, and selling is the same thing.  Because you want to get somebody to make a decision. Who should make that decision? Well, that person. Can you help them make that decision?  Yes. What's the best way? Make them think. How do you make them think? You ask them questions. And then the person goes through a process.  As of clarification and understanding things better, until in the end they go, you know what? I know what to do.  I'm going to get a divorce. I'm going to quit drinking. I'm going to change my career. I'm going to move to a different country.  Thanks so much, Mr. Therapist, Mr. College. Now I have the clarity I need to know what is going to be best for me.  With a sale. I've now got all the information. I've got the details. I know how it's going to impact my future.  I know what's going to happen if I don't solve this problem. I know what to do. I'm going to buy this thing.  Or I'm going to wait because I can live with the problem for a while and longer. All that is fine.  All that is the other person making their own decision. And you just get to help them, coach them, to get to the clarity that they need to make up their own mind.  And that is fun.

31:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

31:11 - Martin Stellar
  Question?

31:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Okay. So I think right now my three biggest hurdles are, and we are addressing them, but anyway, the ICP definition and the match between that and the offer, so it is like two, and getting into the conversations.  Because I'm not getting enough. Yeah. Iteration loops to really practice this, because this makes sense to me, and I think usually when I get into a conversation with the examples I've given you, I'm not trying to pitch, I'm like to a fault, right?  Not even like picking up on some signals, and so, yeah, this makes sense to me. I think I still, it's not, I don't, I don't imagine I can start applying this tomorrow, because I don't think I'll have a conversation like this tomorrow.  I think that's my point. But it makes sense to me, yes, for sure. It's aligned with kind of how I think about this stuff.

32:53 - Martin Stellar
  By the way, before I forget, you asked me for the PDFs, and I haven't got them ready yet, but I have a...  ... ... It's my past list. And once I'm back in my own town, I will work on them.

33:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

33:05 - Martin Stellar
  Got it. Take it. Bear with me. The exercise for this week. It doesn't just apply to sales conversations. Obviously, you have dozens of conversations each week, and not every one of them is going to be a sales conversation.  But even so, when you are stepping into a conversation, especially with a buyer, beforehand, you get to ask yourself, what is it that this person should expect and should not expect?  This person with their plan, or their idea, or their goal, or the question they have for me, what should they expect from a conversation?  What should they expect from the decision that they're about to make? Put yourself into their shoes, and ask yourself what that person needs to be aware of, about the consequences of the decision?  So maybe your brother says, well, I'm thinking about spending a weekend at a resort. Okay, why not? Have a nice conversation with your brother and treat it like a clarity conversation.  So what should my brother be aware of if he's going to spend $2,000 for a weekend at a resort?  Or maybe something very simple where someone you know might want to send their kids to college. Okay, if they want to talk to you about what is best and how to have that conversation with their kids, well, do some homework beforehand.  What should your counterpart be aware of about the decision that they're about to make? About what they can expect, what to not expect, what to expect from having that conversation with their kid.  So it's about putting yourself in the other person's shoes and asking yourself what is going to be meaningful and helpful for them to be aware of.  And if they are trying to figure out what decision is the best decision, well, what qualifiers can you present?  In what way can you make it easy for them to say, yes, I should do this, or actually it's better to not do this?  Does that make sense?

35:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so.

35:28 - Martin Stellar
  How did you go with that spreadsheet, the mine in your network approach?

35:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't do the mine in your network.

35:36 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Okay.

35:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I feel that I've done that before, and um Good. Let me know this. I think I've done at least like three different motions like those in the past year.  And so the first one was around December, I think. That was via the newsletter. It's not the same thing, but it's kind of like that.  Before that, the first one was around November. I found some people and I got into conversations with them, like friends and asked to connect and so on.  And that really didn't lead anywhere. I think that the biggest reason for that was... Around the clarity of what I do, I think it was too early, it was not very obvious, but I do, so people wouldn't know exactly how to refer, and also, like, my social, like, social people that know me network has never been very useful for getting much work.  I mean, there's always somebody that gets me, or gets the thing, and it's really not a lot. So, that first attempt didn't really lead much, and the second one was via the newsletter, and one via the newsletter was mostly kind, like, for discovery, and I led some interviews, and I learned some stuff, it was useful to, you know, to get a little bit better.  you. And the latest one was the one where I tried to get people interested in the whole branding thing, and no one did.  So in my mind, I'm like, I don't want to do like a fourth raising my hand, because it feels to me that I'm coming across as two people lost.

38:21 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Well, I think part of that is going to be solved once you have better clarity on the ICP and the offer.  And so when you do the minor work, it is going to be revolutionary for you as well, if ever you get to that.  Because once you have your offer defined, when you know really who to talk to and what you want to offer these people, getting in front of people with a message is going to be very powerful.  But I think that for you, the biggest breakthrough is going to come from really obsessing. Over understanding people better.  So you said that you like working with nerds. Your favorite problem is creating conditions for lazy work to have high leverage.  You told me last week. Last week? Yes, last week. Last week. And because you're a creative person, and like my friend, Dan calls himself a star-shaped polymath, and it's true, you can do all kinds of things.  And I think you're the same. You can put your hand to all kinds of things and find solutions and create solutions.  And that means that the playing field that you're looking at doesn't speak to you. you. Thank you. The same way that it does to someone like me at this stage.  I look at a terrace full, because we were on the rooftop terrace, of young people and more advanced people, ex-students, but also the CEO of a company who wants to build something new or wants just to be an agaton.  I look at these people and it speaks to me. I know that this one is not the candidate, that one is not the right profile, that one is not ready.  But him and she and that one over there, yeah, I might be able to do something for them or with them.  And I can ask them a couple of questions, because I can identify this type of individual is the right profile for me and may have the kind of problem that I like solving.  Because I figured out that I want to work with nerds who own a small company. I don't want to work with the employees and they have to be real obsessed about their vertical and they have.  Be in the sales process themselves. They have to be the nice people kind who just feel conflicted about it.  So when I speak to people within five minutes, I know whether it makes sense to have a conversation or not.  It's like a bit of an x-ray vision. It's very easy for me to profile people because I've spent so many years trying to be all kinds of things to all kinds of people.  And now I've dropped all of that, and I know exactly what I want to talk to. I know exactly what I want to do for them.  You seem to still be trying to figure out what is the sweet spot in terms of the problems to solve and the kind of people to solve it for.  So if you go and look at your list of contacts, if you create an email, if you try and build a minor...  Database, there is not the clarity that comes from having suffered the way I have. You can skip yourself all that suffering if you do what I should have done five years ago, which is simply to go and interview people and say, I work with this kind of person on those three kinds of problems.  Do they resonate? Do you have those problems? Which of those three ranks the highest? Simply to do customer interviews.  The consequence of doing that is scary. Because from here, you don't know what is going to be the best niche.  And going through the process means that you're going to end up knowing what is the best niche. So your subconscious knows that at some point there's going to be a lot of discrimination and elimination.  So If I go through this process, then I will know who I should ignore. But right now, with where you're, with where you stand, where you're at at the moment, you cannot trust that you will make that right decision.  So your subconscious is going to keep you from doing that work. Because what if you end up making the wrong decision?  That's a potential threat. Okay.

43:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure if that's exactly the foundational thing here.

43:51 - Martin Stellar
  Foundational thing anymore.

43:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For instance, when I See people sharing, like, screenshots of their marketing efforts or, like, the numbers they get or whatever, their cold emails and stuff like that.  That's always very useful to me because I have no frame of reference, right? I'm like, oh, so you guys are really doing the cold email thing and you're happy if you get 1% required.  Okay, so even if I don't do that, that's interesting to know because I thought maybe 10% to 20%, right?  So that's really useful information for you. But I have no repertoire, I have no background in a lot of these things.  And when things are hard, I have no idea if they are as hard as they are supposed to be or if I'm shooting completely into the wrong direction.  And because my thing is confidence, I always assume that I'm shooting into the wrong direction. That's, like, my first go-to explanation for things not working out immediately, right?  And I'm also very aware that I grew up thinking that things were supposed to be easy and so on.

45:05 - Martin Stellar
  And I know that, but anyway.

45:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so, like, the conversation on Friday, like, I've been thinking about, is this workshop really a thing? Because it's not landing, right?  That's how I feel it feels on this side. And you only know if you're early or if you're wrong later on.  So I could be wrong right now instead of right tomorrow. And I was like, yeah, maybe this whole, the way I'm talking about this makes no sense.  Because there's so many, like, parts of it. Like, the whole chain of things, right? Like, it's, do I know enough about this thing?  Do people want this thing? People know, you know. So when I was talking to the guy on Friday, the guy that runs workshops and helps other people create books, it was really a very strong confirmation because he got, like, visible.  And I was like, okay, okay, so I trust that this guy knows something because he serves my kind of market with a different kind of thing, but he sees the value of what I do.

46:13 - Martin Stellar
  It's like a fantastic intersection.

46:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that was one of the best conversations because it spoke to the thing of, does this thing have legs, right?  So if I'm having trouble finding, and this is, of course, a circular thing, like if I have no clarity on what I do, and that leads to trouble into getting conversations about this, which leads to not really knowing what I do, which leads to not being sure, but I'm not sure.  I don't know how much I should bet, right? And like my automatic thing would be like, let's just start building things.  But then I know I'm shifting into the building thing, and that can be a distraction. But at the same time, when I tried to do this like more light touch stuff, hey guys, here's a PDF, I'm doing this thing, what do you guys think?  Nobody really, because I think the internet is  up right now, like with the whole AI, people don't pay attention, right?

47:22 - Martin Stellar
  And you're guessing, when you do this, you're guessing.

47:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not, I mean, do you know how many people I've interviewed the past year? Like I've skipped my Fathom thing, there's like 250 conversations of all kinds of things, some of them are going to work, some of them.  So I've spoke to a lot of people, so my point is not like, I don't want to talk to people, that's not the resistance.  I'm like, I'm not finding these people, that is the resistance. And So that's it.

47:51 - Martin Stellar
  people that you're trying to find then?

47:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Come again?

47:54 - Martin Stellar
  Which are the people that you're trying to find?

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, this kind of – and I'm not saying, like, I'm right and you're wrong. That's not – it's just, like, I don't think it's useful to focus on or focus such a percentage of the energy of, like, it's good to have conversations.  I'm very convinced about that. With that said, like, I can find them. I know who they are when they get famous, but by then they don't need me, right?

48:29 - Martin Stellar
  Like, they seem to have – you sure?

48:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  High degree of confidence, yeah.

48:39 - Martin Stellar
  I'm not a therapist, but that sounds like a lot of confidence. And I can relate. used to be like that as well.

48:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's a lot of confidence. I mean, yeah, that's the big deal. Like, for the past year, I finally noticed that the lack of confidence is the big deal.

48:59 - Martin Stellar
  Do you know that That they don't need you.

49:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How? Why?

49:07 - Martin Stellar
  Was there... How do you know that an Alex Osterwalder doesn't need you?

49:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know the people he works with, and they do the same kind of thing.

49:22 - Martin Stellar
  Okay, so that's one person. And does every Alex Osterwalder profile have those people? Oh, no. you would be one of the next persons in the list of people that they need to hire?  There's a place for you where you are very welcome, where you very much belong, and where people that impress you are grateful that they finally found  Someone like you. I'm not saying you should target the Alexes of the world. Maybe it makes more sense to start a couple of runs lower down the ladder.  Maybe not. Who knows? It's not about going for that type of profile at that level. You're implicitly disqualifying you from having an opportunity with someone like them.  When you actually don't know what all the Alexes of the world are in need of.

50:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. How do I find them?

50:42 - Martin Stellar
  I don't like the answer.

50:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So who's the first guy I interviewed? Is it a book editor? Is it a ghostwriter? Because I'm exploring those avenues.  I'm playing those seeds in that way, right? So I've... It's for non-fiction authors, speaker bureaus, ghostwriters, other guys that do workshops, guys that talk about public speaking.

51:17 - Martin Stellar
  I'm like putting tendrils into these things, right? Right, so you're doing broad surface level exploration. Yeah, and before going into local maxima, I need to map it out, right?  Yeah, good. Yes. Out of all of those people, you know, just with an educated guess, where do you think you would have most fun in terms of the type of person, their type of business, and the type of problem they have?  Where would you enjoy yourself most? Do want to go on the merry-go-round or do want to go on the slides?  There is no need to be studious about this. It can be as fun as going to the fair. Are you going to enjoy yourself most?  What space would you like to move in? With what kind of people do you want to collide? Thank you.

52:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, independent thinkers subject matter. They their own field. They do something. They don't just talk about something. Like Malcolm Gladwell?  No. April Dunford?

53:10 - Martin Stellar
  Yes. Yes.

53:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're very... They're probably trying to go either solo or small and get their independence and exit or... or overtake the corporate lives.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/CZE_m6JpN3XYdNcuMsYTrYRWvay4wy8H?timestamp=3223.934844

53:47 - Martin Stellar
  These are the people in the five Bs. What you're describing now is the start of your hypothesis of who are the people that you should speak to.  And you have the other five Bs. It's the problem, the product, the process, and the promise. So right now, you've been doing a broad exploration.  You're beginning to get some sort of feel about who you might want to speak to, but you still can't find the people because there's a number of things missing in terms of the value proposition, the profile, the exact thing that they do, the problem that they need solved, the product that's going to solve it, the promise to make them.  So I highly, highly recommend spending some quality time with these five Ps and not to figure out what is the direction to go in, but to develop a hypothesis for each of these five Ps.  I think that the problem people most want to have solved is this one. And I'm preparing to verify that.  I think that that kind of problem is best solved with product XYZ. Workshop or coaching or consulting or implementation.  What is your best guess? Not a definition, a hypothesis. Guess. What would be the process of finding them? Well, that is the hardest one to answer right now.  But maybe by creating focused, targeted content for a specific audience with a specific messaging, maybe that will work. We can test that.  But are the people who have that problem that you should speak with? Well, there is an April Dunford, but there is not a Malcolm Gladwell.  Who else is there aside from April Dunford? And you find people at that level and below that level who are in the same space.  So GPT can give you all kinds of answers there. But we have a hypothesis that people like April and the alike might be interested.  And then for people like that with that kind of problem, I promise my stake in the ground. Is that I can solve this problem for you in that way.  Okay, so now you have a five-part hypothesis of your go-to-market, because basically these five P's are your go-to-market strategy.  And then you can say, I'm going to find 20 people like April, and I'm going to simply ask three or five or seven questions.  And if you can get yourself to go through that process, to first do the annoying guesswork into an hypothesis, and then send 50 messages that will only get you 20 interviews, I promise by the end of that, you will have clarity.  You will know things that right now are guesses, theories, wishful thinking, and foggy distances in which you see something, but you don't know what you're looking at.  That clarity will appear if you go through a process like this. Thank I have a hard stop at the top of the hour.

57:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  have to do an interview.

57:09 - Martin Stellar
  How does all of this sit with you so far? A scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is set up and leave me alone, and 10 is, oh, please, when can I get started?  Where are you? What's the number?

57:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. I get it. I I don't don't know. I don't know. Thank you. Yeah, I get it.  I'm just frustrated that, I don't know, but it feels to me that my resistance to this is coming across as very black and white, and we won't solve the resistance by just do it, you know.  There's something else in there. I'm not saying I'm right in the resistance, but I think that the way through is not just do it, it's not Nike.  But I see the value of it, so I guess I'll do it.

58:42 - Martin Stellar
  Also, I agree, and I'm not trying to say just do it. I'm trying to find the team that makes you want to do it.  And resistance is a real , and it is a real thing. I've with it for years and I still do.  The last thing I want is to drive you towards something that you don't feel is what you want to do.  When we get to a point where you want to do this work.

59:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I want to do this work. I just don't know how to do it. Yeah, but we can hash it out on Slack, I think is another word to open.

59:32 - Martin Stellar
  Would you like to make a first pass at these five Ps? Just stick it in the Google Doc, have a beer, throw words on the page, call me an , and just put something out there.  Start tinkering with this.

59:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure. Yeah.

59:48 - Martin Stellar
  Does that sound like fun?

59:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It can be, it can be. I bought one for today.

59:55 - Martin Stellar
  I have two beers and call me more than an , whatever.

59:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  will Yeah. Yeah. Got it.

1:00:02 - Martin Stellar
  You are very good at being very thorough. The stage that you're in now will last until you stop being thorough, as in cerebral.

1:00:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've invested in a robotomy as a service company, so I'm aware of it. Have a nice one. Have nice interview.

1:00:28 - Martin Stellar
  Thank you. Talk to me, okay?

1:00:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

1:00:33 - Martin Stellar
  All right. See you soon.
