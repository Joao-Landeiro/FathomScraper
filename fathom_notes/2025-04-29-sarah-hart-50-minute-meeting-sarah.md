0:00 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  It's just, like, I realized I haven't restarted my computer in, like, two weeks, and there's, like, a thousand files, and everything is really slow.  So I was just trying to, like, close things. Yeah, I know how it feels.

0:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I had to set up a tab limiter on Chrome because it was just, you know, extending into infinity, and now I have only 40 tabs, which I think is still too much, but anyway.  Only 40!

0:28 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I didn't know that existed. That's cool. A tab limiter. What does it do? It just kind of gives you, like, a notification, like, no tabs for you today?

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it just, it can only have so many tabs open at the same time, and there was another one before this one that would just give you a little bit of a warning, but the one I have right now, it just opens and closes the tab.  So it can be frustrating if you're, you know, if you don't have, like, a breathing room, and you're in a meeting, and you're going to do things.  But it forces... It's to not leave articles open forever. Just decide what I want do with them. I know.  That's so hard because you're like, I'm to come back to that one.

1:09 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I got to get better.

1:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have like a Notion database.

1:12 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I got to get better at like just like popping them in there. So it's like come back to these later ideas.  Yeah.

1:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've started to print them. I mean, it's not very sustainable, but at least I get to read them eventually.  Oh, no way. That's a good idea.

1:26 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Do you have like a legit printer? I have a normal A4 printer.

1:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  just feed it, recycled paper, and eventually I get to it. So I think what I've noticed is that I need to have it kind of in my space.  Otherwise, it just disappears. And then like months later, I'm like, oh, my God, this is amazing. Where did I save this?  It's been obscene for months. I know. There's like too many things.

1:53 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  There's too many things to explore, right? yes.

1:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

1:56 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Only so much time to do it. True.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for the message and the video.

2:04 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, yeah. I'm really grateful that you had some space to chat with me. I've been kind of thinking about this for a little while.  So, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how it kind of fits into my business. Mm-hmm.

2:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What got you interested in that? mean, I know I watched the video, but was it the J thing? If you had to order it, was it the J thing?  Was it the expertise demo? Anything that made you initiate the conversation?

2:35 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Oh, initiate the conversation specifically?

2:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

2:39 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I think because you posted the Amira board, I was like, oh, there's cool stuff in here, but it's been on my mind.  I think I've checked your website a couple times to see, oh, does he offer something?

2:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was like, oh, does he offer something?

2:54 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  So I checked your website and your newsletter a couple times.

3:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you very much for being patient with that. It's a bit embarrassing given that I'm speaking to a pro, but anyway.  So basically, if you've been following for a while, you see that I like to nerd out on this stuff.  And I've started to make like a conscious decision to be more openly nerdy about it. And it seems to attract people that, you know, they get it.  So that's very nice. Yeah, I get it.

3:35 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Like that board specifically, was like, oh, there's so many cool things in here. And yeah, there's just, it gets your mind excited when you see all the things you can be doing.  Yes, yes.

3:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love Pinterest too. So that's a bit of a time sink sometimes. But I've been seeing you around for a while.  I mean, I think the first time you popped into my radar was roughly a year ago or so. It was taking the Unignorable.  Oh, no way.

4:03 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Awesome.

4:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. I didn't finish it. But I think it plugged me into that kind of group of people, and then it kept popping up.  I like that you had... I think it's difficult. It was probably difficult to come up with a unique angle towards content for expertise and so on.  And I think the way you framed it is really good. It's like, oh, this is a really good coining of what's happening.  And these things don't happen by accident. So surely you've been thinking about it for a long, long time.

4:49 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Well, yeah, I think specifically after I did... Well, actually, I found you through Alex James, and I took Alex's course.  So I... His messaging course really helped me really just like identify what that positioning and like messaging was going to be and create my own methodology around it.  So that really kind of like I did his course last summer. So since then, it's just been very like, OK, I'm like trying to make this stronger and stronger as I go.  So I'm feeling good about it. Good, good. It seems to be working.

5:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is working very well.

5:28 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Congrats. It's good. Yeah.

5:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe I should take the course. Oh, yeah.

5:33 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  You haven't taken Alex's course yet. It's brilliant.

5:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I should. I should. Yeah, it's really smart. Those those those carousels he creates. I remember like somebody recommended his name to me.  And when I saw it, I was like immediately I had to send him a message. Oh, my God, so much.  I think I used the expression wit and taste because those things are difficult. Coffee, right? And really like his perspective.  I think he would be happy that I said I like this perspective. Anyway.

6:08 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, he's a trendsetter, I'd say.

6:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it feels like that way. But tell me more about like your signature framework that you do and from what I could gather in the video, I think you're kind of exploring ways of making this I'll paraphrase, right?  More interesting both to you and your clients. Is this a good? Yeah. Yeah.

6:37 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Okay.

6:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And and I think the the prompts that we we could discuss at this point is maybe like the first contact, right?  When people do go through the initial conversation that you said you don't enjoy so much. What what don't you enjoy so much about that?  Is it boring? Yeah, it's just really boring.

6:57 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  It's just a bunch of questions. Um, I, yeah, I just feel like, I feel like I could be doing this better.  And recently, um, I sort of partnered with a sales, a woman who's doing my sales, and she's also going to be doing part of the project management.  And so I'm like, I have another big project coming up end of the month. So or end of next month.  So I'm thinking, okay, with her, I want her to help me facilitate these workshops. I actually a little bit of backstory.  When I was a creative director at an agency, I also did more of like the brand sprint workshops, different companies.  That was that I kind of thought they were kind of , to be honest, but you know, they'd these long, uh, you know, they felt more like an experience, right?  Like you'd bring the client in and you went through the whole process. think it was the Google sprint process or whatever website and the brand strategy.  And so yeah, I I I like the experience of that, but I'm also like, sometimes don't really need to do very much with my clients because I kind of get it right away sometimes.  But yeah, so it's kind of like, I don't know, just thinking about experiences and how I can do that.  Because every touch point, you know, should be, I want it to be really memorable and strong.

8:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've heard people say something along the lines of, want to be a, maybe not exactly this phrasing, but very similar to this, I want to be a status symbol.  Like I'm quoting people now saying, I want people to think of my services like, oh, I'm excited to get it.  I want to tell the world that I got it and, you know, stuff like that. exactly.

8:50 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Exactly. Right. Like I don't want just the generic thing. Oh, I want a whole experience.

8:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you know what? I kind of agree. That's some workshops are , so it's very fine that we put it out in the open.

9:04 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I I'm glad you agree, because sometimes it's just, there's a mix of like, there's a lot of taking people on the ride sometimes, you know?  Yes, yes. Get them indoctrinated into the, I mean, sometimes you need to do it, because you kind of have to get them into your way of thinking, which is what I've been starting to do, is like introducing the full sales funnel methodology and bringing people through that, so.

9:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is there a specific part, like, you've used the word indoctrinate, which is a good word, good one. Is there a specific part of what you do that seems to be trickier for people to get?

9:41 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I think we're, it's not, it depends on the client, but most, like, I need my clients to be okay with doing something different, which goes against, honestly, like our own brains function, you know what mean?  Like, we kind of generally fall. into whatever else is doing. And people like to think that they're they're being different and unique, but they're not actually, you know, there's a good there's a lot of comfort and just like looking good versus actually doing something that pushes the boundaries.  Right. So like putting them into a state where they're like ready to do something that's that's a little bit scary.  Right. It's it's it's sometimes a big job. That's interesting, because I would assume that.

10:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I will say we shouldn't assume, but I will think out loud. I would assume that people come to you and at least some people, they come to you.  I like your work. I want to I want you to help me with this stuff. They answer the questions that they're all about references.  They come back with things that fit them, but are not what everyone else is doing. And they're like, this is really nice.  I can't post it. I don't feel comfortable.

11:00 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  posting and they procrastinate on that something like that yeah yeah that definitely sounds like them for sure yeah and but your best clients don't do this they just trust you right away yes yeah like so i have a lot of clients who are just like yeah ready to go um i guess it's just like more just like nurturing that process like i want to make sure that they're all in at all points you know what i mean um and understanding the the system behind it but yeah once in a while though i do i once in a while i do have to i get someone and i'm like oh they they're listening but they don't really get it you know so i've had you know i've had instances where i'm like okay we have to go back to the drawing board so okay okay but so here okay i'm gonna think out loud i like to think out loud um you

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's an aspect of this, which is like the first interaction you have with them, which right now works.  It's not very exciting for you, but it gets the job done. It's been successful. There's also an aspect of you want to have every touch point to be interesting and different and unique and something worth writing home about.  Yeah. And you have these clients that they need to use the word, put them into a state, which I like, of a certain, I don't know, openness or trusting you.  In your experience, are there things that most increased like this openness to your work?

12:47 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I don't know. I know like psychologically, like I know that there's things I can do.

13:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you think of a time, like a specific client, that they seemed that they were going this direction, and then suddenly something shifted, and they were like, oh, yeah, I'm in.

13:15 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Nothing is really coming up for me. Okay, okay.

13:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a big question. Because what I was thinking is, there's different angles that we could apply workshops here. So the first one, I think, is what I would call it, or perhaps the bronze option.  I like to think like bronze, silver, gold. So the bronze option is, if you're thinking about workshops, is to convert those questions that you have into a series of activities that you do with them, and just allow them to drop references into it, and something like that.  I would assume that maybe this is on your radar, or you've been experimenting with it. But this is more like a one-on-one sort of thing that would replace.  Or improve on the first contact, right? But there's another thing that you've mentioned around the indoctrinating and getting people to join your world, which I think is a bit more before that, which I think is a bit more like maybe a group thing.  Maybe what Jay does with the Masterclass. And that's a different kind of business objective and different mechanic. And I think these are the main two that I'm seeing right now, like closer to us.  Any of this makes more sense to you? Yeah, no, that makes sense.

14:33 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, think there is the smaller offer. That's the workshop that I'm I think I mentioned that I'm working on a course right now that I might I might instead do a workshop version of it.  And so there is that. And then I think there's the yeah, the gold standard client experience.

14:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so one is more like for client acquisition. Yeah. Yeah. The other one is more for the client experience.  Exactly, yeah. Okay. Which one excites you the most?

15:13 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Well, one is more time-sensitive.

15:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, that's a type of excitement.

15:20 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  It is a type of excitement, yeah. do have this new project starting end of May, and this new partner I'm working with.  So that is kind of top of mind for me.

15:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Would that align more with the client experience sort of thing? Yeah, that's more the client experience. Okay.

15:49 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  But I do want to do, like, I want to be thoughtful about all of them. Like, I'd like to do the sort of...  Um... Um... What is the word? What did you say? Expertise workshop. Yeah, I think I just, yeah, I'd like to play in that space a little bit more, generally.

16:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Is there a specific thing that you think people are not, let me rephrase. Is there a specific thing about your work and your expertise that you're like, oh, wish more people could see this thing that you would like to put on a stage?

16:37 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  So I guess, I'm not sure this is exactly what you're talking about, but where I'm working with a beta tester for my course right now, we kind of work, it kind of forced me to create like a whole curriculum about how I would design visual branding.  And so I realized like the biggest piece really is buying that differentiated signature element that you're going to base everything.  Everything. Thank And so doing this beta launch, I realized like, oh, I feel like that piece in itself is separate.  Like it could be the starting point because then after that, there's a lot of more complexity. If I'm going to go in the direction of teaching someone how to brand themselves fully, like if that's a big chunk to teach and smaller element of that is that distinctive signature element that I could teach.  And it's something also I've given, like I have, I developed like some AI prompts to help people. I've even helped a friend who has like worked with a designer and her stuff looks great, but like she didn't have something that was really unique to her.  And so we use the prompt and work together. We got it. We got her in a good space. So I feel like I kind of like feel like that's thing that I talk about a lot and also what people need to kind of move forward with designing the rest.

18:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I know what you mean, but just to be sure I don't go on the wrong track, could you give me some sort of an example?  Yeah, yeah.

18:16 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  So with the beta tester, Robert, he's in like an AI space. And so we nailed down like a design aesthetic.  Of course, we're like, we make sure that he doesn't do his circuitry graphics anymore that are so overused in that space.  anyway, yeah, so we like found his style references, which were like a little bit of like these sort of Bauhaus poster style, these blue color is.  And so then we took once we had that nailed down, like the. I think it was the mix of the poster style meets a little bit of this like pixel style and even like created his own little.

19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh,

19:00 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Ascot, which was really cool. So once we had that, it's like, okay, great. But that can be hard to get to sometimes.  It's like, what is this thing I want to build this whole little brand off of? I know it when I see it, right?

19:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

19:19 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah.

19:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And in your experience, when you say it's hard, does it mean that it takes longer or some people need a lot of iteration?  Yeah.

19:31 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Like, it's very, you know, we're a lot of my, most of my clients are founder led, right? And so it's not the same strategy as a business, like a business business.  The person who's going to be like part of it, you know, there's a personal piece to it. And it can be just difficult to like nail down like what beyond just a color and like a font, you know, like what actually, what visual choices are actually.  I'm going to represent my message and what I stand for. There's a lot that goes into it.

20:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think there's another thing that maybe we have here, which is a specific tool to figure that out. So we can separate the tool and the process, right?  Some people go through the process really quickly. Some people take more work. But I would assume that the kind of thinking you go through with them is roughly the same.  Like the mechanics of your questions are probably the same, but it just gives them in a different sequence. Or, I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong.  Is this roughly accurate?

20:49 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, yeah. It's all the same process. But there's different inputs and different people will pull from different... ... ...  ... ... ... Things.

21:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's a choice.

21:03 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  There are choices involved, right? Yeah.

21:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because one of the things I like about this is the idea of archetypes. So you probably notice patterns in your clients, right?  Like some of them you're like, oh, it's going to be difficult to work in this way, but it's going to be fun to work with them in this way, right?  Yeah.

21:21 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah.

21:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if you surface that kind of thinking, maybe you don't call it archetypes or anything, but if you surface that kind of thinking, it also acts as a way to prime them for when it gets hard, you say, remember, we said this would happen.  I've seen this before. It doesn't mean they'll trust you immediately, but at least it doesn't make it feel like so existentially, existential usually.  And the good thing about archetypes is that they are non-judgmental. Like, oh, you are like this kind of person.  It doesn't mean that you're better or worse. It's just these kind of people do well with these things and struggle with these things.  Yeah. So, in my mind, I'm role-playing this, right? Let's say I'll share what's going on in my mind so you can correct me if I'm wrong.  So, let's say you were working with someone that they'll say, I'm a very visual person, everyone says this, right?  But they really struggle to point at references that they like. Is this a pattern?

22:25 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. It's like some people can point to references, some people have, yeah, no references, some people have a ton.  It depends on the personality.

22:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And when you realize that you're dealing with someone that doesn't have explicit references, what kind of things do you ask them to do?

22:44 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  So, for that, I've actually developed like a chat to you, yeah, a chat prompt that pulls from their messaging what visual person should do.  So, it's more of a reflection of the business messaging versus like their personal preference. So that's been, that works really well.  Okay.

23:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay, so, sorry, I got excited and went on a bit of a tangent, but let's regroup here. So, this thing that you have more, that is more, that's closer to us, it's about a larger project.  You want to, you are going to do it with someone else as well, as like an assistant or, I mean, you're leading the project, but that person's helping.  Is there any specific part, like, if you were to apply the usual questions to this client, this big project?  Would that be a problem?

23:52 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  No, it wouldn't be a problem. Okay.

23:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And by having... This more encompassing experience, instead of just the questions, your expectations, that they really get excited about it, and so on.  Cool. Can you share anything about that project? Is there anything special about it, besides the size?

24:23 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Let me think. I guess this client specifically has said that they've worked with multiple creatives to get the vision, and with no success.  So I feel like it's a little bit more pressure, I guess. Okay. And also, this client, when they did the sales call, they pretty much were saying all the exact...  Things that I want the client to say, like they were, you know, wanting to do something different, to stand out in their space.  That's what's actually really exciting. It's like they're in a really boring space, like tension space. So there's such an opportunity to do something really cool and like just not the same old, same old stuff.  So, yeah, like I, I think with every client, I want to make sure that I always do my best work and get them to where they want.  mean, that's obvious, but yeah, like this, I think could be really cool. I always think about like case studies, like I want everything to be a case study, right?  I want, oh yeah. So, but yeah, I think, what else about this client? Yeah, no, I think that's kind of what's coming up for me.  And when you think about like your spider senses, are they?

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tingling it on something for this client. That's a good question.

26:10 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I think, okay, so I think with the, like, online space that we're in and, like, the perception that you create online and where I have not interacted with this client before, I think there's a little, like, pressure to be what people think you are, you know, online.  You know what mean? And so, like, do you know what I'm saying? Like, there's...

26:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I do, yeah. It's like, I have anxiety. Yeah, me too.

26:40 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I don't feel like I'm a very good workshop leader. I don't feel like I'm very good at this stuff.  You know, I feel like I actually kind of hate it because I feel like I don't like explaining myself and guiding people through stuff.  I'm like, just let me do it. This is what I like to do. Do I really have to explain it to you?  Like, you read the post. I'm just, like, but I'm... To, like, come sort of, like, change that mindset I have about workshops and client meetings and stuff like that, where I can feel a lot more comfortable and, like, honestly, I'm not judging my presentation skills, not judging my, you know, my workshop, you know.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

27:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, got it, got it. So one of the things that came to mind when you said that they work in the pensions space, again, me assuming, is, like, that maybe there's several people involved in this and decisions will be made by a group, like approvals and stuff like that?

27:46 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Well, that is a pain, but this, no, it's just the founder, which is good. Oh, okay, okay, good, good.  Yeah, yeah, no, that's, yeah, definitely had some. Yeah, that's actually another thing, too. I've had, like, clients where it's been multiple people.  And it's like your main bottom person is like in it, but then other people are not. And then like they're almost like, you know, not quite getting what you're doing.  And so that's definitely a pain point I've experienced too.

28:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did they share anything with you about what didn't work with other innovative firms?

28:27 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Oh, that like they just do the same stereotypical thing. Like designers, they just know how to like make it good.  They don't know how to like think about what the competition is doing and how to like totally subvert that in a new way.  So even if you tell them they don't, sometimes they don't know. It is a pattern. And I had a friend recently who went through a whole brand strategy process and like, you know, in the brand strategy.  They talk about, you know, the competition and being different and wanting to stand out, yet it's the same old, like, she's a writer, and they put, like, little pencil drawings as her, like, graphic element.  You know what mean? It's, like, stuff like that. It's, like, obvious. Like, you're just going to get, like, blended in with everybody else.  And then when she says to them, we really want to stand out, all they know how to do is make the colors more bright.  It's, like, they're not thinking about, well, how can we use, you know, visual in a very strategic way, like, you know, clay, and they have all the clay.

29:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Smart.

29:44 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  That was very strategic, how they, like, owned, you know, this actual clay subs. It's, like, there's nothing more. And brave.  Stripe as well. Stripe, you know, they're in fintech. Everything was blue, you know, trust, trust. They have a blue, you know, fintech brand, but no, they went full, like, gradient rainbow, right?  It's so, like, and not everything has to be like that, of course, but, like, anyway, I'm going on a tangent, but that's kind of it.  Okay, okay.

30:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so what I'm thinking around this is, at least for this client, perhaps a direction that could make sense for a first workshop or for some of series, I don't know, is when I said you don't like explaining yourself, in my mind, it went to a place of you have good reasons for making the creative decisions that you do, and the dynamic of trying to get people to understand it, it's frustrating, because sometimes they don't see the nuance, and you lose something in that, you know, oh.  So, In my mind, the picture I'm painting of the kind of cool workshop for you for this first thing would have to be something that has kind of a...  You know on DVDs when you watch the director edition and they have the director comments? On this scene, I like the scene in this way because this allows me to express whatever.  I really like that idea and I think experts tend to like it as well, right? And I'm sure you have this.  It's obvious the things that you tell. So even the frustration you've expressed that designers doing the same thing, it points towards this.  It's like there's a method to this and there's a way, a disciplined way of looking at this stuff. So if we could shape those interactions in a way that we can hint at, hey, there's a principle behind this, but there's a reason behind this, or why am I asking this question?  I think that's... Powerful.

32:01 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Okay, yeah, so we even connected the questions back to the strategy in the first place. Yes, yeah, yeah.

32:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's great.

32:08 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  That's a really good takeaway.

32:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and so, and sometimes, I mean, I think you're very good at this. Sometimes you just need to hint at it, right?  You don't need to say, I'm asking you this because of that. It's just like, game recognized game. They're like, oh, yeah, I see that the way this question was phrased means that, you know, Sarah gets it.  So it's just being like an explicit objective of the workshop design. I want people to understand that there's a logic and a set of principles behind this.  Also, when you say that there's an element of being brave there, I think we could also inject into an experience like this.  could inject moments of, to create the awareness of what this will take. what So, here's what's going to happen.  You will feel these things throughout the process. Like, for instance, there's a thing I like to do, which is kind of a bingo for after the workshop.  And say, okay, so after the workshop, people will feel these things, right? And eventually, people feel some of those things.  Maybe not all the things, but some of those things. And a bingo is non-sequential, right? So it doesn't matter when they feel it.  It's just like, oh, yeah, I'm feeling unsure about the decisions I've made. João told me I would feel this way.  He really gets it, you know? And that's something you could put in the workshop itself. Especially at the first one.  Like, we are at this stage. We're going to do these things now. And after this, these things are going to happen, are likely to happen, right?  And I think this also seeds the brave aspect to it. Like, we know this is going to be difficult.  It's to be difficult in these ways. And we're going to do these things to overcome that challenge. Mm-hmm. Is this, am I going, because I get excited about this.  No, that's right.

34:07 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Like, I, yeah, I'm thinking about how to structure it. And also very curious about, like, is there another way, something to add?  Like, what are the other ways to go about this first, you know, kickoff meeting? Like, maybe there's, I don't know, something else I could do.  But, I mean, you do, you, I assume you do a million workshops. So you would probably know, like, every format possible for this kind of thing.

34:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, so, yeah, there's many things I believe we could do about the kickoff meeting. And they happen on a bit of a spectrum, right?  From, like, super interactive and formal, which is perhaps, it's like a two-by-two. So interactive and formal, which is, like, give them a questionnaire and they fill it in and that's it, right?  And then you could have interactive and, I don't know, more experiential, which still... you. The backbone of it, underneath, it's a form, but it doesn't feel like a form, right?  It's like, oh, what's the favorite scene from a movie you've seen? I don't know, something like that. This is still like data collection, right?  And then you can have some stuff that is perhaps less interactive and more about just you telling them stuff like, oh, there's these different options, there's these different trends, right now we're seeing these patterns, you know?  So there's different ways of approaching that. But it feels to me that for this first encounter that you're describing, it makes a lot of sense to collect the perspective that they have and the problem definition.  It's very useful to collect the problem definition because people change and we can always go back to it and say, hey, is this still the problem definition?  yeah. Okay. So that's a good thing to collect on the first encounter. And then I think that, like, the sky is the limit that you  Should have like physical things, send them like a book or a workbook or stuff like that. I think eventually you might want to do this, I suspect, but it's like a harder thing to make happen and more expensive as well.  Like onboarding kits, right? That's cool.

36:19 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah.

36:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to do one of those someday. I'm doing mission patches as we speak. Come again? What's that? Oh, the patches from the space missions?  Yeah. patches for projects that people do with me. Then they get a patch. Oh my God, I love that.

36:40 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I think I saw that in your board.

36:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. Cool. It was in the mirror. I love it. Yeah, thank you. I like that kind of thing.  But to your question, like other things that you can do. Yeah, basically I think about about it in those.  I Thank Those axles, like formal, more informal, and pulling information out of them and giving them information, right? So formal and giving them information is giving them a lecture, informal, and asking things out of them is kind of asking them to make a collage.  You know, there's extremes to this, of course.

37:27 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Oh, did I just fall off?

37:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I think I'll go back.

37:33 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  And then is there, so there's some things I usually, like, collect beforehand. Like, I might ask them to put, like, their brand strategy doc in a Google file, like, and any, like, other design references, like, so they can kind of think about it beforehand.  Like, is there any benefit to, like, doing that in the workshop versus, like, what you should do beforehand? Oh, got it.

37:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect question. I would avoid doing that in the workshop workshop because... The time you spend together is really valuable and it's very easy to get people to spend too much time explaining.  Most people don't know how to present. So if you're trying to present the brand guy, they'll just go slide by slide and you waste all the time.  I think it's good that you ask it beforehand. Maybe, I wouldn't necessarily think this is like a high leverage thing, but maybe you could ask them to send it before and also as you ask them this, say in our session, I'd like to know which aspects of the brand book are more arcane or more difficult for you to understand.  You know, this would connect the async to the sync moment, but it's just, it could be difficult if they are yappers to hold them if they start, you know, explaining the whole thing.  Yeah.

39:01 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  For me, that's difficult as well.

39:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I really struggle with, you know, getting people to stay on topic. And I think for a lot of people, that's difficult as well.  So I try to just avoid creating those situations.

39:15 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, same. I know. It's like, I don't want to be rude, but something could go off forever.

39:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. So yeah, anything that you can do outside of the workshop, I think it creates more density in the workshop itself, right?  So people can get more value out of it. But also, because you have this more detailed way of looking at this, of thinking about this, I think you want the most time on the workshop where people can see you think, right?  So some people, I don't How do you feel about this? Some people really hate to improvise, and some people like to ad-lib things.  It depends, and a thing could be shaped either way. But if you feel comfortable with usually getting it really quickly and making acute observations, you can inject moments like those in the workshop that give you the opportunity to highlight those strengths.  And if you prefer to arrive at the workshop with things a bit more prepared and not feel the pressure of being witty on the spot, we can also put those things into the workshop.  Like, for instance, let's say you ask people for the brand guide, and you spend some time going through it, you put it on perplexity, you extract some ideas from it, right?  But we could have, on the workshop assets, we could have some space for you to put in, like, main lessons I got or main things I got from that.  This is not difficult to do, and also, you know, sets you up for, you know, looking great in that moment, right?  Cool.

41:13 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, that's a good idea.

41:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, people often, I think you know this, people, they have a limit to how much new things they can see.  So by starting the workshop with things that they may be already new, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Just, you know, like, yes, I feel seen.  Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I make that mistake. try to be like super, you know, witty, and people are like, yeah, I guess.  They get it. They just think it's like a convoluted way of getting there. Like, yeah, okay, sure.

41:47 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, so like really just sort of like build that rapport in the beginning, make them feel seen. Yeah. Yeah, cool.  And so, yeah, like actually thinking about the whole workshop, like almost like an emotional journey. Yes. We're like, because I usually what I feel is like after I asked 100 questions is I just feel like everyone's drained.  And like, they're just happy to get off the call because it was like an hour of answering questions. So I think I need to, like, you know, build in some more insight so they feel excited.  You know, and I think what you've said so far is really will be helpful.

42:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, like one way you could do this, and maybe you do this already, but I found this interesting, is inject some things, some facts and figures that might not even be about branding, but relate to their industry.  You just go, I don't you're going perplexed, you say, I'm serving this kind of client, please find me some industry reports for their industry, and it will find you some, and then you ask, oh, give me a couple of tidbits around this.  So It's very easy to put that at the start of a workshop or a presentation or just a conversation.  And that's like Maya, most advanced yet acceptable. They're like, oh, I didn't know this about my industry, but this makes sense.  So they're already getting the benefit from interacting with you. Easier said than done, right? But if you have an assistant, maybe that's something she can help with, like operationalize.

43:26 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, she's much more personal than me, so I'm excited.

43:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You seem quite personal. Oh, thank you. But yeah, underneath this is, yeah, I would rather not be there sort of thing.

43:40 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Are you a cat person?

43:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No.

43:45 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Actually, my dog is behind me right now, but yeah.

43:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So let me just recap a bit so I don't get lost. I mean, not everyone has cool conversations like this.  We start... start... We started chatting because you were intrigued about if there was a way of me to give you some pointers on workshops for your work.  And then you figured that there's maybe two main directions. One is the first contact, and this one is more about client experience, and the other one is more about client acquisition.  A larger thing that you run with people. Yeah. And from there, we started to talk about this client that is, you know, starting in May, you said?  End of May? Mm-hmm. And we've used this client and this upcoming project as a prompt to think about what would be a nice, you know, first workshop for you and what you do.  Some of the things that came from this, like, ad-libbing were... And maybe shape the workshop around creating opportunities to highlight what's unique about working with you, right?  So truly standing out, looking at the competition, the brave thing, helping people that maybe they don't really know how to communicate what they want, but they know how to do this.  And I think there's a subtle point here, which is sometimes designers do the same thing for everyone because people don't know how to express what they expect.  And if the designers don't assume that responsibility, they don't have much to work with, so they'll do just template-y stuff, right?  But if you do, you, Sarah, if you do have this habit of really trying to extract something out of them, then by definition, you'll have more materials to work with, right?  Like, you're... Means and plus is much better than other designers. So we were thinking about maybe shaping the first interaction around creating these opportunities, right?  We've also discussed how to integrate the reports that they send you and stuff like that, and there's some ideas around that.  Yeah. And there's also another thing that you could do, which is you said there's around 100 questions. It didn't feel like 100 questions when you sent the video.  sorry. Not really. Oh, okay. You know. Yeah, because we can make some, we can vary the type of questions, right?  So, and by doing that, we keep it interesting. So putting things on a range or saying, voting on things or describing things or pasting links, all these ways we can mix and match.  And it keeps the thing exciting for people. Yeah. to see. You And you don't need to do this on Miro or anything.  You can even do it on Google Slides if they're well set up. So that's how... Is this useful for you?  Can you see yourself applying this stuff? Yeah, definitely.

47:14 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, for sure. It's very helpful. Even just talking it out is nice. We know when our clients say that to us, but then we forget.  I know. We always forget that, right? We're like, oh, I'm just wasting time. We're like, no, it's really nice.

47:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Perfect. Would you like me to send you a proposal or something or to have a different conversation to get into more detail?  Or maybe for now it's already useful for you to have some ideas on what to do?

47:49 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Yeah, I'm generally curious just about what's your business like. What are your offers? What do you do? I mean, know what you do.  Yeah.

48:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so my offers are not super tied down right now, but basically I have this help you create a workshop thing, and I've been trying to do it under four sessions, but I think it's better if it's like six sessions, six 90-minute sessions, and this costs $2,000.  And at the end, we have like the format, so this means the assets, the scripts, a little survival guide, like what do do if people don't talk, what do do if people talk too much, what do I do if I want to do this in real life and not just on a computer screen, stuff like that.  Cool. Yeah, I think sometimes people get hesitant on things that are relatively easy to solve, so I try to make it.  And I've also been helping other people. This is more like, I've been doing this mostly for friends. Like, try to come up with their own visual frameworks.  But I suspect you don't need this.

49:06 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  I would be, I'm sure it would be fun to put someone else that's got a creative mind. Yeah.

49:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's funny because the beginning sections of both of these things are very similar. They are about expertise elicitation, elicitation, like, tell me how you work.  What's the criteria that matters for you in this kind of project? Oh, that's the criteria. Why is that criteria important?  Oh, because there was this one time where I did a project, failed, and I discovered that this was important.  Oh, okay. So that's part of your method, you know? So the first half of both of these things is very, very similar.  And then one goes into, like, a deeper workshop thing, and the other one is more visual frameworks. And I think I probably need, like, just being very transparent, I think I probably need something.  something. It's a little bit more free-form right now, but I've been struggling with what that is exactly. So, yeah.  Cool.

50:09 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Like, who are the people who usually come for, like, the frameworks?

50:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So far, there have been people that they do something that's a little bit weird. And, okay, so one example.  There's a guy that does, like, psychedelic retreats. Cool. He's very cool, and he's a cool guy as well. And one of the things he was telling me about was, I feel this is so interesting.  He said, I can't do paid ads, because if I talk about psychedelics, I cannot do paid ads. But if I talk about my methods, I can do paid ads, you know?  It's like, ah, okay. And there was also another thing that I think you would appreciate, which is he really, that person, they, they don't like either the...  the... Super Silicon Valley, microdosing, turbotech, only performance thing. But they also don't love the Pachamama, nature is your mother, a raccoon kind of thing.  So it was like, I need to find ways of talking about this that show that it's in the middle.  Yeah, smart. Yeah. Yeah. And another guy, which is also a friend, I mean, he does something that's very funny.  Funny as in interesting. He helps companies that have an aging workforce not to lose that knowledge. Oh, wow.

51:42 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Cool. It's very cool.

51:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And he's also a very cool guy. It's funny because on one hand, it's very like process oriented, like process engineering.  But he's super, super like an artist at heart. Super nice guy. And so, I mean, they do have... Expertise businesses, yes, but they don't do the same thing.  And these are the most recent. The other ones were earlier in the last year.

52:11 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  So how do they do, like, what visual frameworks do you, what do they come up with?

52:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we try to think about frameworks that answer one question per framework, right? Instead of, like, oh, I have this theory of everything, which is very difficult.  Just, oh, there's a framework for how I qualify my clients. That's visual thing. There's a picture, really. Oh, I want a framework to convey what's important to me when selecting a knowledge base.  And so that's more a comparative kind of framework. Or I want a framework that tells people what's unique about my method when compared to other methods.  So. So. And then sometimes you can say the same thing, like it's the same content, but the format changes, like Venn diagrams, right?  Venn diagrams, they already know how they work. But there are other ways of saying the same sort of thing, like when you have those matrices, that you have like element A, element B, element C.  And what happens when you have element A, element B, but you don't have element C, right? This is also a Venn diagram, just looks different, but like the architecture of it is the same.  It's about the intersections and the overlaps and so on. And like timelines and that kind of thing is always very useful.  People understand that very well.

53:51 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Cool. And so, yeah, that's pretty interesting. Like, and so they've come to you specifically, like knowing that the, their workshops weren't working.  No, not necessarily they had workshops.

54:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sometimes it's just like, because I've done the conference illustration thing, like go to conferences and show it up. When people see me do that, they're like, oh, and then they see that I talk about the workshops.  And some of them, because I think I should be more explicit about this, but some of them, they see the connection, like, I think you do this, right?  And so, yeah, I do that. So, yeah, but I need a more structured way of talking about it. I'm working on a website.  So I'm vibe coding a website and going crazy on it. So amazing.

54:36 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Amazing. Yeah. No, yeah, that's cool. And I actually just read a book. You probably really love to. It was all about the psychology of like presentations and like how to use visuals to like guide.

54:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's the name?

54:50 - Sarah Hart (sarahhart.ca)
  Right here. So good. It's a woman. She did. I think she's got like a famous Ted talk about presentation.

55:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nancy, Nancy Duarte? Thank you. Thank
