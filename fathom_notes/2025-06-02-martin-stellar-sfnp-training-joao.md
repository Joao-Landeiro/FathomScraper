  I can hear you. This meeting is being recorded.

0:03 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Have you been?

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. I'll be a bit stuck.

0:11 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, I noticed. Let's see if we can get into that today. So, first let's talk about the meaning of things.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/om8MW8n-zwx42hhkH8ZKPXMM6npcioSz?timestamp=27.032618  Are you familiar with Alfred Korzybski?

0:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No.

0:35 - Martin Stellar
  He was in the 60s at the forefront of psycho-cybernetics. Just a second.

0:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But. No, so what? So they're going to have him. What? Come again.

0:55 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. He was at the forefront of psycho-cybernetics.-cybernetics. He He Thank Which later became neuro-linguistic programming and became part of a lot of the common understanding of psychology.  And he came up with this term that the map is not a territory.

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I use that a lot. So that's the, yeah, okay, got it, continue.

1:19 - Martin Stellar
  The problem with being a human is that what keeps us alive can also kill us. So we have this built-in confirmation bias that we make snap judgment decisions on what we perceive in world.  And that's very useful in an evolutionary sense because if you live in the desert and you see something pressing a hill there on the dunes, you want to assume it's a warring tribe and you run.  Because if you don't, it might be a warring tribe and you die. So anything that is new, anything that is unknown and potentially a threat has to  The flip side of that is also that if we see something that we like, or that looks good, or that we're hoping or expecting, we're going to assume that it is what we think it is.  And so we eat the wrong berries because they look so tasty. And then we die because they were the wrong berries.  So this built-in mechanism of assuming that our heuristic is correct and factual and accurate is what stops us from getting results with people.  Because somebody will do something or say something and we go, ah, it's exactly what I wanted to see. It's exactly what I was hoping for.  So we then react based on our understanding and our wishful thinking effectively. And the other person may go, yeah, but that's exactly wrong.  That's not at all what I said. And then that person disconnects. So you're going through a process of getting to know another person and their challenges.  And it is a very subtle dance. And the moment you make... Incorrect assumption, and this happens not just because of assumptions, but it's also because of operating without permission, or moving too fast, or being too convincing and persuasive.  You call the other person to lean back instead of to lean in. And where it comes to the, let me get my notes up, yes, where it comes to confirmation bias and this map, it's very easy to get it wrong, because the other person is an entire world.  Now, this buyer that you're talking to, that's sonder, that is an entire world unto themselves, and all you know about this person, I know you live in Brazil and you're from the Porto area, and I know that you have an unshaved face, and that you're a joao, and that you're trying to figure, and that's about it.  I know five or ten more things about you, and that's it. What is there to know about you? Well, you tell me.  We could take a week and I wouldn't even begin to know what you're about. And when you're talking to buyers, it is extremely dangerous and risky to fall into the trap of hearing what you want to hear.  And what people tell you, so you have these three pillars, right? You have the questions and the answers. And now it's the meaning of those answers.  When somebody says something to you, what actually does that mean? And the most blatant example is when somebody goes, yeah, I like it.  Okay, then you want that to mean, okay, sale, we're going to move on. I'm going to send a proposal.  But that yes, that could be a counterfeit yes, could be a way to just make you go away. That yes can also be simply a confirmation yes.  Ah, sounds good, tell me more. Or it can be a commitment yes. I like it, let's do it. How are you going to know which of the three yeses you are hearing?  The moment you Make an assumption, you're 30%, 60% possible that you're wrong. And if you then operate and respond out of that assumption, then you just might lose the sale simply because you got this connected from the buyer.  You got in a lack of alignment and attunement because you made an assumption. So you have this person in front of you.  You know practically nothing about this person. That is the map that you have. That is like looking at a country on Google Maps and seeing there are cities here and roads there and train rails there.  And there's a lake and that looks like mountains. And that's the depth of your resolution. In Sales for Nice People, as you have these conversations and you learn your people, it's like zooming in on the map, constantly adding in detail, amplifying your knowledge and understanding of what this individual is about.  That's it. You So you create a much more detailed, higher resolution map, you upgrade your heuristic of this person, and the consequence of that is something very fundamental to quality human interaction, is that you make the other person feel seen, so in the Zulu language there's a greeting, and that means I see you, and then the other person goes, which I think is just beautiful, because instead of saying, hello, where the God in me salutes the God in you, like namaste, it's like, I see you, I give testimony to you being present to me, I mean, I get goosebumps just thinking about the meaning and the implication of treating people that way, and on a far more practical example, I once was at a Christmas party at my friend's house, older lady, and I'm a friend of the family, and her daughters were always,  And so this Christmas party was falling apart because the ex-husband was there as well for some reason. And the daughter and one of the daughters was freaking out because my mother is, she's losing weight and she's depressed and she's anxious and we need to call the doctor and say, Zoe.  So I went up to her and because of her freaking out, her mother was getting more anxious. So the whole evening was falling apart because Zoe was making it worse.  I went to her and I took her hands and goes, Zoe, I see you. I understand how worried and stressed you are.  We need you. And the moment I said, I see you, she's just relaxed, you know, shoulders fell, jaw slackened, she started breathing again because there was somebody there who, who took a moment simply to give her the visceral experience that somebody was noticing.  And that made all the difference. And then the evening continued fairly. Okay. So being able to make the other person experience that you are seeing them is immensely powerful.  And you do that, for one thing, by being very, very careful, never to misinterpret anything. So anytime that somebody says something, you need to use what I call the live model.  You listen, you interpret, you verify, and then you equip them with your idea, your suggestion or whatever. Most people go, I listen, I interpret that as something that I want to hear, and I'm going to equip you with my idea, my suggestion, my proposal.  But that's a lie. You need to listen, interpret, then verify that you got it right. And if you did, then you equip them with whatever good idea you have.  And that verification is simple. That's simply developing the habit of saying to people, just so that I understand. Let me get this straight.  Let me confirm that with you. Did you mean to say that you want a proposal? Did you mean to say that this is a problem you have to solve, that there's a now motivation behind it?  So a constant routine habit of questioning your own understanding because the more you hear what you want to hear, the more likely you are to be wrong.  And that will always go against you. So you simply stop. When you go, let me get that right. Did you mean to say X, Y, Z?  Then your buyer, your wife, your anybody will calibrate your understanding and then you know where you stand and you're seeing the thing the same way.  You understand what they meant. You can now continue the conversation based on what they actually wanted you to hear, not what you thought you heard.  Sure. George Bernard Shaw. Sure. Wonderful quote that the single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.  And if you think about that, it is so true because we always make assumptions about things or we say things and then we think that we communicated something and the other person heard something completely different.  So that habit of always verifying that you got it right is fundamental. And then you get to ask yourself questions as well about the way people talk and react.  So look for the body language, look for the way people respond to you. When, you know, because when they give you an answer, what does it mean?  Reflection, objection, brush off, why would that be? So what are people saying? What are they not saying? What do you think they are saying?  And what do they correct you as having said? And there's a very, very interesting mechanism at play when you start practicing with this.  Because ultimately, the goal of the conversation is to state the problem better than they could. Because if you get to the point that you understand their situation so well that you can wrap your head around it, and you can state and explain the problem better than they could, but then obviously, automatically, they're going to consider you the person who has the solution at hand.  Now, how do you get to that depth of understanding? You ask questions, obviously. You keep asking questions. You do not pitch.  And you keep asking for replication. Did I get that right? Did you mean to say? And if you do that a number of times, you will reach a point where you see empathy and epiphany.  And that's when... when... The of Chris Voss, the negotiating expert, the person will go, yes, exactly, that's it, that's right.  And when you hear that, you know you've made it to the point where you are now being considered as somebody who truly gets them, which is kind of fundamental because you don't get the deal if you don't get the buyer.  Now this also ties in with the concept of the problem stack. You start asking questions. You start looking for the reasons behind.  You start looking for confirmation that you understood. And at some point, you end up with your buyer going, you know, in the conversation, you uncover that as a leader,  I find it really challenging to give good feedback to people. I often get the feedback back that I'm a bit of a dick when I give feedback.  But, you know, I'm working on that. I have a coach. My wife tells me, I'm a therapist. Okay, so that is one problem.  Tactless leadership, let's say. Second problem is that... There's a lot of gossip because leadership makes so many changes all the time and then people start talking about what's going to happen next because everybody has whiplash from all the changes.  Very common in productivity contexts. That's your second problem. And then the third one might be that our people are undereducated.  Our staff is really good. We hire for personality, but all those great personalities don't always have the right skills.  And so we're going to need to educate them a little bit on how to handle things. So now you have identified three reasons why the productivity is too low.  Leadership is not tactful enough. Leadership makes too many changes. people, actually also a leadership problem, never got education. That is now your problem stack.  That is leadership, too many changes, lack of education. That three-legged stool of the causing problems is now a portable definition of what actually is the problem to solve, that you can take through your conversations.  Portable is the key word here. So, for instance, I might be talking to a CEO, and then I have to also go and talk to the CFO and see if we can get signed off on the budget.  If I then have to explain to the CEO that, yeah, in the interviews and the talks with the CEO, leadership needs improvement, and we're going to need $15,000.  And the CFO might go, yeah, well, leadership needs improvement. I mean, of course, leadership is always the problem with productivity, but it's a lot of money.  And no, but now I come out and say, well, you're CEO and a couple of stakeholder interviews. I realize that leadership needs to be better at giving feedback and not change so many things.  And actually, you're also going to have to educate these people, which we can do in a one-day workshop. So the problem that we're looking to solve, and it's going to cost $15,000, is taxable leadership.  Back, not too many changes, stay the course, and educating the team. Do you have a budget for that? Now I have taken a definition that everybody will recognize, that I can put in front of anybody who I need to speak with, whether it's the actual team in the day of the workshop, or the CFO needs to sign up, or the CEO that I need to get a reply from, that they're going to go, oh yeah, these are the three problems.  We have a constant activity. So the problem stack is an anchor that you can keep using to center the conversation around what matters most, what actually is the job that we have to do here.  So that's a different way of saying how to recap and summarize the problem. These people show up and they have a hundred different challenges, dozens of problems.  And in Tweet for that they need to select a couple of them that are going be useful, help them identify the problem stack to be like a tool of the quarter problem definition, which you can throw into organization data.

19:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And be very, very, very, very, very with confirmation bias.

19:20 - Martin Stellar
  We all love hearing what we like to hear.

19:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the happier you are hearing what you want to hear, the more likely it is that you got it wrong.  Question everything, especially yourself. Got it. Then that is the meaning and protection against assumptions and their devastating effect. So the homework is simply to start developing a habit to respond to people by saying, you know, to recap their statements and ask if you got it right.  Hey, just so that I understand, or help me understand, did you mean to say, or asking for a no, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you say XYZ, does that mean that?

19:02 - Martin Stellar
  And that should keep you safe.

19:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

19:22 - Martin Stellar
  Any questions?

19:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'm organizing my thoughts because, yeah, this makes a lot of sense. I think we both have this epistemological perspective on things, so it works really well for me.  Map and territory, the ontology of things, the languaging aspect. So that speaks to me. And the portable definition, to me, this again connects with the languaging aspect as well.  There's like a... a... There's like a... There's Overfitting to the model, which is me thinking, must it always be a three-legged stool?

20:09 - Martin Stellar
  But I know that with time, this will get, you know, more flexible.

20:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's good. Also, another thing that has been useful for me is... I'm trying not to get into much of a branch, but one of the challenges for me in getting the confidence in creating an offer and a stack, it's like, this is what I do exactly, and so on, is this kind of, again, the overfitting, like, oh, productized means box, right?  And, like, taking things to strict and to buy the book because of, like... Of contact with reality. I know what this means.  So one of the things that has been helpful in that sense was I was talking to someone the other day, a while back, and I was talking to them about the confidence hit that is, look, I've planned this workshop in this way, but things have evolved in this direction, and now this exercise does not make sense anymore.  So I used to see that in a very bad light. This proves that I didn't consider all the possible ramifications.  And I'm intellectually aware, but not yet emotionally integrated in that sense, that I know that that's not my job to predict every ramification.  But so what that person said was like, no, just say, I have planned for this. Maybe this makes more sense.  Are you okay with that? And that's, that was. So in parallel with our conversations, like in my readings and stuff, and this whole, the verify thing has been helpful also in that sense, because I think it relates to the whole humble consulting dialectic sort of thing, which speaks to me as well.  So, and I was reading the book, I don't know if you've seen it, Let's Get Serious, or Let's Not Play, really like it.  And they keep mentioning this, which is whenever you see a yellow light, you say, hey, I see a yellow light, you voice it, you give options.  So this whole verify thing has been reframed in my mind as a pro move, right? Pros. Check for agreements.  Absolutely. So that makes sense. I mean, the ethos of this, it's in tune with all the things that make sense to me.  And I would say that for me at this point, the major elements, don't know what's the architecture of this, but the major elements of this are like this epistemological perspective, like how do I know these things and make sure and all of those things.  And also the peer-like relationship of it's okay that maybe I didn't get this right. I'm not trying to trick you.  Did I get this right? So that speaks to me, as I think I've said. So right now... So, is this point in our lesson a waypoint in the middle of more content, or is this like a chapter into other things?

24:19 - Martin Stellar
  How do you mean? This is the content for today. And then it's going to be into a whole bunch more things in the coming weeks.

24:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect, perfect. No, no, perfect. So, in that sense, I didn't know if I was just expanding too much on the intro.

24:33 - Martin Stellar
  you got it real right. And this might also be part of the unlock for you, the stuckness. You said humble.  A lot of selling is terribly, terribly arrogant. People come out and they're like, okay, you have a problem. Well, let me show you my pitch deck, because these are the slides.  This is how we solve your kind of problem. And I'm... It assumes that you know things that you have no idea.  You're just treating everybody like the same cookie cutter problem, and you have the solution for all these people. There is an implicit arrogance and conceit in that, that your pitch is so good it's going to bowl them over.  Your project and your implementation is so good that it's going to fit their problem. How do you even know?  You haven't even spoken to those people, and within five minutes you're showing them slides?  off.

25:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, I think this is like the major... Um, not even unlock, but the inflection point, I think, for me, because it's not difficult for me to be humble.  It's difficult for me not to feel that being humble is a self-own, right? Relating to the Portuguese, like shooting my foot, right?  Related to the whole Portuguese tenderness and so on. So the humble, that's easy for me. The problem is that, um, framing this also internally as that's what professionals do.  It doesn't mean that I'm weak. I am not humble because I'm, I'm not weak because I'm humble. I'm confident because I'm okay with being humble, you know?  And I admit that, like the limits of what I know. I think for me, this is probably specifically, like the, the, the biggest lever because of the popular culture about confidence, always a closing and all that .  So, uh, I, I've written here, like the, the whole permission to be humble. And like, I'm okay, I'm fairly comfortable with self-deprecating humor and all those kinds of things.  things. I do think that there's a calibration that needs to happen on my side.

27:20 - Martin Stellar
  Mm-hmm. And

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in my mind, it's a bit of tempering or seasoning that humbleness with something else, because right now it's too much on, haha, we're buddies, I'm so happy you're just talking to me, you know, and there's something else that I'm still not.

27:18 - Martin Stellar
  Focused curiosity. It's very much like a doctor. Doctor, my back hurts. You go, okay, lift your arm, put your foot to the side, bend over, see if you can turn, let's get to the heart of what actually is the problem.  Is it because of your shoes? Is it because of your bed? Is it because of a slipped disc? I have no idea.  There's a thousand ways people can end up with an aching back, and I have no idea, and I'm not going to prescribe anything.  I'm going to do everything that I can to figure out exactly what is the problem, because I know nothing.  About you, sir. I know. About the body and physiology, that's it, because I don't know you. Now, any doctor would be taken with a lot of respect for having that attitude of simply not knowing anything about the problem and the patient.  But a doctor who says, oh yeah, I've seen that before, you say that it's when you lift your left arm, it's because of a so-and-so.  The doctor might be right and would be taken as very confident and knowledgeable. The doctor might also be wrong and kill someone, who knows?  So, the humbleness, it's, I don't like the word, but you can weaponize it. You can make that humbleness a strategic tool.  And you can say that when a buyer comes to me, like yesterday, last Thursday, I'd met a girl in Malaga.  At the rooftop thing two weeks ago, we spoke for five minutes. And then I put the PDF of the deal diagnosis in the WhatsApp group.  And she writes in and she goes, hey, remember me? We spoke at the rooftop event. This program, is that for you?  Because we're startups. And is that for us? Because we're startups and I'm completely new to sales. So instead of going, yeah, of course, it's for you.  I said, I don't know. It depends on a number of things. Your grit and being comfortable with showing up to new people.  You know, it's one of the first requirements. So let's have a conversation. Let's see. There's a lot of centers would go, yeah, absolutely.  You're a startup. I have a deal coaching program. Totally. Here's the PDF. Have a look. the sales page. Instead, I will routinely tell people, I don't know, I have solutions, I don't know if they're for you, but we can sit down and find out if they are.

30:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And that inspires a lot of confidence, because I demonstrate that I don't have the conceit of thinking that I know what's best for people.  Perfect. No, I get that. I get that. So. There's two themes right now, and I'm thinking, so the first one is the whole parallel thread on Slack that I think makes sense to touch on.  And the other one is, so on Friday, this is just like an example for, so on Friday, I got into a conversation with someone.  And this person, I don't think, okay, let me say, I'll tell you this story as factually as I can.  I found someone online, and she held... Like founders and so on with messaging and content and stuff like that.  So she's used to working with people that are companies that do like weird things like crypto and stuff like that.  Right. I saw her. don't know how I checked their website. I thought it was cool. And I was doing like the whole adding people on LinkedIn, but kind of targeted sort of thing.  Not anyone. But it was mostly like, I know that we see the world in, you know, comparable ways. And I was I added there and then I sent a comment like, oh, very cool website.  Jealous. Just that. And she then sent me a message like, oh, I checked your stuff. Your stuff is really good.  You want to chat? OK, so in my mind, this was like this is peers having a conversation. I will not approach this from a sales perspective.  Assumption. Yeah. And so keeping up with the factually thing, we started to talk. I noticed that I didn't really have.  And I don't have. And I understand that there's probably like too much script and too little script. I'm really not here.  I'm probably here. You know, like I have no structure for these conversations. And I think that there's probably like a minimum skeleton for them, which I don't have.  And and then we get we got to talk and like vibes. And what happened was something that has happened other times, which is we get to this sense like.  Like the face is like this. There's something here. We don't know what it is. And maybe we are not.  We're kind of serving the same audience in the sense. But maybe we are not really. Each other's customers, but I don't know, we should do something, you know.  Which on one hand, you know, feels good. But on the other hand, also feels. Yes, I'm doing this thing again, which is deflating the tension by saying we are just buddies.  When dating, I did that a lot. And at the end of the conversation, was like a one-hour conversation. like, oh, nice.  There's something here. Let's keep in touch. Let's keep in touch. Also very open. So it was a good conversation, but at the same time, it was like a repetition of all the conversations I've had.  I didn't feel like my capacity to convert into income increased with this conversation. It was within my circle of confidence, a small one.  So anyway, so this is the story. And I know that you cannot diagnose the story just by me telling you this.  But this is something that's on my mind. And the biggest takeaway from this in my head is I think I need...  Some bare-bones structure on how to manage these conversations. Because socially, I mean, I am naive, I think. So I think that's a good thing.  Because at some point, she was like, no, because maybe I could be a client.

34:15 - Martin Stellar
  Maybe not now, but maybe I could be a client. Jesus.

34:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know? And the other day, another person, a different person, she also came to me and said, actually, you never tried to sell me anything.  was like, what? But I thought I was trying to sell things, you know? So clearly, I'm really bad at this.  And I mean, this is like, it's just a repetition of my teenage years of noticing that people actually like me.  I didn't notice that. So, yeah. There's something in there.

34:48 - Martin Stellar
  Like, I don't know if your program covers cluelessness, but there's something in there. Don't be so harsh.

35:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm really good at that.

35:06 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, it goes with conscientiousness and integrity as well. Did you read the Triage Call series?

35:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did that come again?

35:18 - Martin Stellar
  Triage Call.

35:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't think so.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/om8MW8n-zwx42hhkH8ZKPXMM6npcioSz?timestamp=2124.643413

35:23 - Martin Stellar
  Because... Right.

35:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Triage Mini Training Parts 1 to 7?

35:40 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah. Yeah. So this is a set of questions. You don't always have to ask each of these questions when you're in a buyer conversation.  But it's very good to have them in your back pocket. So I'll send you the link. I think this looks a bit broken.  Interesting. So I'd suggest you go through that. Here is Slack. Right. But also, never, never start a meeting without getting the other person to state their goals.  And so you step into a meeting and it seems social and just friendly and casual and getting to know each other.  And you might be right. There might be nothing there. It might just be somebody who is looking to meet like-minded people.  But this girl, when she said, well, it would be a client, maybe it's... Point. That's the invitation to look, to ask for permission.  Basically, it's an implicit invitation to start a sales conversation with her. So when you hear something like that, and you get this signal, you go, hang on, just so understand correctly here.  Do you mean to say that you need some help with the kind of things that I do? Is that something you'd like to have a conversation about?  So that is your opportunity to turn a friendly chat into a sales conversation in a very innocuous, innocent way.  But anytime that you get on a call with someone, no matter who it is, it's always very useful to start by saying, okay, what made you decide to meet?  Or what is the ideal outcome of this conversation? What would you like to walk away with after we speak?  What would you like to achieve here today? Because then you get the other person to share their agenda, and from that you can keep the conversation relevant to what matters most to them.  Okay. Good. So let's see. You're stuck. What do you want to do about it?

38:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, of course, getting unstuck. Thank So one of the reasons I think, going very meta, but anyway, one of the reasons I think I'm stuck is that I feel that, no, never mind.  Okay, let's just, no reasons, feelings. So I feel stuck, and I feel that it's difficult to generate. So I have a bunch of hypotheses around the five Ps, right?  And some of them, you know, fit together, and some others don't fit together, and so on. But I understand that this makes sense to have hypotheses about that.  So, okay. And... Um... Why do I feel stuck? I think it's, again, related to the conversations. I don't know how to get into the conversations that would give me, actually, empirical data.  So that's why I check reports, right?

40:24 - Martin Stellar
  Check reports. How do you mean check reports?

40:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, industry reports and, like, desk research on what people are complaining about.

40:32 - Martin Stellar
  Oh. You know what that's called? The technical term?

40:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm sure you have a funny name for that.

40:41 - Martin Stellar
  Procrastination?

40:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. No, because, okay, no, perfect. I'm not defending the procrastinations, but let's unpack it. My feeling is, like, I have, I don't know how to ask people about what they think about this.  So I try to look for... That tell me, give me like, like a sense of what it is, right?  And which is super dangerous, especially with the AI, because I'll get really competent on making nice reports. Then I get these reports and they tell me like all this, like I am, I'll have 18 pain points in front of my, this kind of thing.  So I, I feel stuck and then I, I don't know how to have the conversations that would get me unstuck.  And then I'm like, oh, I need to prepare for the conversations. And then I do the research and the research, the research gives me kind of a sense of progress, but I understand that it's not really progress.  It's just a groove that is getting deeper and I get into that groove, right? Okay, but the thing is, the whole thing is, I don't know how to have these conversations to check for these things.  So if it were easy for me, it would, if it were easier to have the conversation than to do the research.

42:00 - Martin Stellar
  Oh, no, the research will always be easier.

42:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I know that.

42:04 - Martin Stellar
  The research is mental .

42:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so how do I have these conversations?

42:12 - Martin Stellar
  Hi, I'm João. I have one question. Do you have back pain? Yes. My next question is, since when? Is it the upper back or the lower back?  Thank you very much for your help. Would you like me to let you know when we have developed a remedy?  Yes, no, thank you very much.

42:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Goodbye. Okay, I get that. So two sessions ago or one session ago, it was really, really useful when I just shared my screen and we did it together, right?  Sure. So what I've learned from that was that the whole branding thing didn't get a lot of traction and I stopped putting...  I actually interviewed a couple of people. I think I spoke to maybe five people. Was it easy to get?  Yeah, relatively so, the people that replied. Okay. So, why is it difficult? I think one thing that's holding me back is the whole addressable.  I don't know how to find. It's annoying.

43:44 - Martin Stellar
  Who do you like most? Come again. Type, who do you like most? What type of business owner are you most excited to meet with?  So it is not about demographic. It's about the type of person.

44:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nerds.

44:05 - Martin Stellar
  Nerds. Okay. Why nerds?

44:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because they're curious and competent. Open as well. Lots of nerds.

44:32 - Martin Stellar
  What is your favorite kind of problem to solve?

44:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um... Yeah, mod... Disciplinary, needs creativity, needs a little bit of,  it, let's do it, kind of space for a joke.

45:11 - Martin Stellar
  Tell me about the problem, the problem you like solving. So for me, for instance, I really like solving the problem my page doesn't convert.  You've seen that. I'd go in, we tweak, copy. It's fun. I like that. Bring me something broken and let me tinker with it.  Another really fun problem to solve is they're just not listening and I don't know how to reach these people.  Wow, so you need to have breakthrough conversations. Hold my beer. Let's have a look at your problem. What is the kind of problem that you most like to solve?  Okay.

45:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is it doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. Hold I'm going to start ad-leaving because, okay, I think it's about creating conditions for high leverage so this would be one, right?  Creating conditions for high leverage, for lazy work to have high leverage. So Give me an example of that. So this is not a professional example, but then we get there.  My desk next time. It was too big, and because it was too big, I decided I needed to make it smaller, because then I cannot keep some papers on top of it, so I'm forced to organize it sooner, so I don't get too much work in progress, so I get more focused.  So this kind of thinking, which is like creating conditions where doing the lazy thing gets you results, I like that, right?  And in terms of the workshops, which is why my workshops are not sophisticated or extravagant, the mechanics are very simple, because the progression between one exercise to the other is usually so smooth that people don't even realize that they are going through a journey, right?  Because what I like is to make it really easy to do the effect.

48:01 - Martin Stellar
  So you like creating forcing functions?

48:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

48:09 - Martin Stellar
  So, do you play music at all?

48:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you play music at all? No.

48:18 - Martin Stellar
  For people who don't know music, they think that improvisation, know, playing solos, that must be so great because you get all the liberty and the freedom to go all over the place and you can do whatever you want.  Actually, that's not at all the case. If you're going to solo, you have to know what chord progression you're in and you have to know what is the tonic and the dominant and you have to know what are the scales that you can play because within those, you can do anything you want.  Then you can also break the rules into different scales, but then you're in a different scale. So you're always going to be within restrictions.  So... And the more specific and well-built your restrictions, the more they enable things. I lived in a monastery, lots of restrictions, right?  And now I have a really lovely ability to concentrate on things because I spent 12 years, and there's another bunch of examples, outcomes from having lived with so many restrictions.  When you reduce the size of your desk, you're creating restrictions, a forcing function that then, by virtue of forcing, makes other things better.  So let's hold that thought as one of the types of problems that you most like to solve, and that's in your zone of genius.  So you can work with nerds because you like them and help them restrict stuff so that other things become easier and less effortful.  The next question is... What problems do they like to solve? Nerds. There's nerds from yoga to biology all the way to AI and JavaScript.  What type of problem does your ideal nerd like to solve?

50:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My ideal nerd has a very specific or personal perspective, worldview, and they find ways of expressing that worldview through their work.  So...

51:00 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Within that, what kind of industry... You know, it's like you mentioned dating. So you'll be in a disco or a restaurant and you'll see someone attractive on the other side of the room.  go, wish I could just go over and have a conversation there. Does she look so... Gee, maybe tomorrow. What kind of niche, what kind of industry in the nerd space is the attractive woman that you've never spoken to or that you've maybe had a chat with, but you've never gone out with a woman like that?  What is the candidate that just keeps coming back to your mind?

51:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, okay. Perfect. People that have created an industry from their inside. Okay, so like the business model canvas guy.  It's like the... Pattern saint of this. The guy has the Alex Osterwalder from the Business Auto Canvas.

52:07 - Martin Stellar
  Yes.

52:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are familiar?

52:09 - Martin Stellar
  Yes.

52:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I think it's kind of a pattern saint of this because he has a PhD thesis, which is about, it's not cybernetics, but it's close to it, business ontologies.  And then he creates a whole thing out of it, right? And the metagame of turning that unique worldview into an industry, that's what my browser history objectively says that I care about, right?  I'm always reading about that. So I think that's the game that I really appreciate.

52:51 - Martin Stellar
  How are you doing? How are you with scary things?

52:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not great. If I said it was great, they wouldn't be scary, I guess.

53:07 - Martin Stellar
  Well, one thing you could do is send an email to Alex Osterwalder and say, I'm doing research. Would you mind spending 20 minutes with me?  Because I'm trying to understand people like you better. Thank you.

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank Okay, I have like a list of maybe four other people as well. I'm not saying this to not do that.  I'm thinking that I can send email. I know people that know him on the first name base that could probably introduce us.  So sending the email is not difficult. I'm assuming that there's two parts of this. One is like, okay, let's burst through the resistance and just send the email.  Cool. As research, if it doesn't get back to me, it doesn't help, right? So I could just, you know, send him that email and send a similar email to other people that have done similar things and have a list of people like this.  So, Now, I asked them about them. What do I get out of it? This is not me trying not to do the work, okay?  So this is me. I think there's some ones here. Okay, let's verify. What do you think I would get out of sending that email to Alex?

55:36 - Martin Stellar
  Courage. Okay. If he replies, it will also get you a new connection. It will give you insight, intel, of a quality and depth that you cannot predict.  It might be very superficial if he's not engaged, or it might also be really helpful. question. but This is the whole point.  If I look at that Slack message from last week, there's huge lists, many different questions, all kinds of challenges, confusion.  There is an enormous amount of intellectual and existential even complexity that you're trying to solve for. You're trying to bring yourself to a conclusion and a well-rounded, sensible set of decisions that inform actions and direction.  The problem is that you're working on something that is so complex, multivariate, and tied in to fears and childhood and what people say in social ethics.  You cannot reason yourself to answers here. It is impossible, in my opinion, fundamentally impossible, to resolve all of that in an intellectual process.  The only way... That you can get answers like that is by gathering data. And for you to ask the question, what did I get out of sending an email like that, kind of points at the fundamental flaw in thinking.  That you're trying to solve for something in a rational way to get to a certain goal when you are seven steps or more removed from having enough data and insight to actually get to sit down and do rational processing and decision making.  The goal of speaking to an Alex or anybody like him isn't to get something out of it. It is to sit there and be a sponge and learn things, discover things, collect data, learn a person, see how that intel settles in your own mind and how it collides with the ideas and the questions that you have.  And then you do that with Alex and then you do it with Ginny, Jormy, Jenny, Jerry. And then very automatically, you're going to realize that the number of questions, challenges, and considerations are not relevant.  So there goes half of your task list and your problem stack. Problem, problem list. They keep going and you go, well, these are the ones that stand out most.  So I can park what's left. And by and by, in the process of having all those conversations with people, you're going to find the clarity that you need.  All the answers that you're trying to find, they're not going to come from what I say and they're not going to come from what you think.  They're going to come from the mouth of the people who ultimately are going to buy from you. So, in your situation, I would park everything that I've been looking at, working on, thinking about, and simply say, the the mouth mouth  I'm going to look for 50 people like Alex, maybe the same level, maybe a little bit below, it doesn't really matter.  They should be as close as possible in terms of profile and interests and IP, and send them all a message.  Very simple, saying, hey, I'm doing some research on the challenges in your industry. Would you mind 20 minutes on Zoom for me to ask a few questions and learn?  I'd be so grateful. You send those 50 messages off, you'll have 15 or 20 conversations, and then you'll know things.  And everything that is not directly demonstrably built to get you the next conversation is, by definition, a distraction from solving what you're trying to solve.  So your razor is going to be, will this get me in Interview. If it doesn't, well, should you really be doing it?  The industry report, the looking at your lists, asking me a question. Does this get me closer to the next interview?  No? Well, okay, then let me go and do something that does get me closer to the next interview. It's fun.  Once you get this started, once you start having those conversations, you'll realize how nice it is to connect with people and learn from them.

1:00:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, absolutely. And I think, I mean, my point is not that I don't want to have those conversations. My point is, I do have some of those conversations, and I don't think it's so much about...  Convincing me to, that's nice to talk to these guys. You know, one of the things that made the most difference for me was getting a Tidy Call link and just starting sending messages on LinkedIn.

1:01:14 - Martin Stellar
  And I've had a lot of good conversations around that. Okay, well then now the question is, would it make sense to have a research project and send messages to 50 people and get 20 conversations?  Thank you. I do have to go in a minute.

1:02:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:02:05 - Martin Stellar
  No, yeah, I guess, yes. And we can work on a small set of questions together in Slack if you just create a Google Doc.  In fact, I can show you one of my question sets. Probably two. Moral, because I have a more meetings.  Yeah, sure.
