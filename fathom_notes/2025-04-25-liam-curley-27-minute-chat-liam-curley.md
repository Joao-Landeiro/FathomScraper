0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, and you? Okay, thanks, man.

0:03 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Listen, I'm always worried. I was going to pronounce your name as Jao. No, hang on. But Oren's been pronouncing it differently, so I wasn't sure.  How do I pronounce your name before we get cracking?

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, bingo. Everyone starts with that question, which I find very gracious. The actual thing is Jaoelm. It's very nameable.  if you catch a cold, it's a good time to practice.

0:31 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I've got a bit of high fever, so.

0:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Jaoel. Jaoel, yeah. It's like Ju was wow. Do you follow football?

0:47 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Not really, but yeah, that's a good place to learn the names. There was a player, and I think they always pronounced it right.  I don't think it would be Jaoel Cancelo. But I don't think the commentators I've ever said joaol. I'm not sure.  I'm not sure. Yeah.

1:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, my whole life, people have asked me this, and it's very difficult to say, just clog up in rows.  But I appreciate that people try to do it. Joaol. I'll give it.

1:17 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  So, Joaol. Yep. Well, it's good to meet you, Joaol.

1:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good to meet you, Liam. Yeah. Finally. Yeah, I'm really happy. Yeah, yeah.

1:25 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  So, how did you meet Oren? Was it on, I think, on the audience building? Yeah, yeah, The Unignorable Challenge.

1:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's, actually, yeah, Oren was doing that, and, but I don't think I've realized, I had realized that he was doing that.  I don't know. It was there, but I was not aware that it was there when it happened. And then he started popping up on my radar, and I started commenting on his stuff.

1:55 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I really like, well, I like your articles, but I remember seeing your visuals, really liking them. I was always wondering whether you made them or not, and then obviously I saw the post you did relatively recently showing what you used to do for work.

2:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, yeah, thank you.

2:11 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Yeah, your work looks very, very nice, very well presented. I like the visuals and everything. Thank you. So you've got quite a nice range of skills.

2:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's nice to hear, but it's also a bit of a, there's a cost to it, I think. There's a big cost.  Yeah. I think you can relate.

2:35 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Well, I used to make, I, my visuals aren't as good as yours, but I do make visuals. And at one point I just felt it was holding me back because I was doing the visuals, I was thinking around positioning and messaging, all that kind of stuff.  And I felt like. Because I was doing all these different things, and visuals being one of them, I wasn't going or spending all my time on one, and so I was getting left behind by the people that were spending their time on one.  So that was just me, I'm not saying that's you, but yeah, so I recognize the challenge is that you can do the visuals and you can do the writing, and you can do this, that, and the other, and so you do do it all.  And it just obviously naturally spreads your focus and concentration and the skills that you're trying to improve in the craft.  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

3:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And with this whole AI coding thing, I just added another thing. think, do you know that question, like what would you do if work was no object?  I think money was no object. Yeah. I think... I just got a workshop, not a physical workshop, and I like making things.  Yeah, I saw that, cool, the book that you're making with the...

4:11 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Oh, the guillotine.

4:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Booker, yeah. But yeah, I'm like moth to a flame. I have creative ideas, and then I stop things and go do them.  I shouldn't do this, I'm aware of it, but it's very, very difficult. Well, maybe if you take that out, maybe you lose something else.  Yeah, yeah. I've decided to try to show more of that, so at least I have something. Because I've been this way all my life, and now I'm like, yeah, maybe if I show it, at least people get to I think it's a good idea.  Yeah, thank you.

4:48 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I liked seeing it. I got one client who, he's based in America, but he was in London. And... So I went to see him, and we'd been talking through some ideas and whatnot, things, and of plans for how we were going to work together and what we were going do.  And so I bought like a little notebook for watercolours, so it was thicker paper, really nice. And so I was doing notes and illustrations in it and everything to map out my thinking of what we could do, of the kind of strategy for the next six months.  And it had illustrations as well, colours and things. I like doing it right. helped me think it through. But I took it to the meeting, the physical thing, handed it over.  And he seemed to like it, right? He seemed to be happy with it. But then a few months later, when we would talk about other things, he kind of pulled it off his shelf and referenced and said, I refer to this, you know, this, you can't do this in notion, Liam.  What you did here, doesn't, you don't. His words were, you can't get this  in Notion, as in, you know, it had a big impact.  So I do think there is something about physical, especially with clients.

6:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Especially when it's unexpected.

6:15 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  And so that's something that I am now feeding into client work when if the package, if the price is big enough where I can justify it, I will, at the end of a, I'd say it's a 12-week engagement, capturing their ideas or whatever, I will make, I will have a physical thing that I do that with and post it to them.  And the idea, it kind of leaves, it's a nice thing, right? But it leaves a memory. kind of physical and it's a memory.  it's when you then follow up with, here's how we can keep working together if you want. And again, my client gave me this idea and said, if you do that to everyone, that thing will be sitting on their shelf and they'll be thinking, that's what I could have had if I worked with Liam.

6:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so it's.

7:00 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Like that extra thing to think, yeah, yeah, come on now, I want to work with this guy. But yeah, sorry, I've gone off on one, but yeah, the physical.

7:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Liam, Liam, this is uncanny.

7:09 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Yeah, I was like, I could see you sending that, and I could see, but seeing you make it was nice, but I I think a lot of people love that kind of stuff, when you send it to them.

7:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, I need to circle back on a thing, because you've mentioned like this, the physicality of things, and I'm full on believing on that, and so this week, I should get a custom stamp that I got, and the stamp is a little mini form, so it's very small, that can say how much and how you've used AI.  And it's not really for clients, it's just that I like physical stuff. Physical stuff that is related to how you work, so it's full on.  And another thing, this week I've just got, I've ordered some, I didn't get them yet. Do you know when astronauts go on a mission and they get a mission patch?  Patch?

8:17 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  No. Like Artemis.

8:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. But they have like these really intricate ones because, you know, going to space is kind of a big deal.  and I'm making some of those for like small projects. And I don't expect people to apply them, not just to stick to them.  But it's the same kind of thing. Like it's easy to ship. It tells so much, it conveys so much about how you think about things.  Yeah. And yeah, I think we have a similar perspective on it. And you know what?

8:50 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I think what you're doing as well, I think it's a little bit different as well. Do you know Louis Grenier?  Do you know his The name rings for me.

8:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Grenier. French guy.

9:03 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  So when he wrote his book, he had lots of little things made, so it was like he had some stickers with the rooster on, and he had a money belt and stuff like that, but it didn't make me feel the way that your stuff would, because it wasn't.  There's something that, yes, it's the physical thing, but it's the making it with your hand, or being like really intentional about how, even if you didn't, he's even making it with your hand, or being really intentional with how it was designed, like it was your design, even if you, and so, although his stuff, he sent it, it physical, I didn't really feel anything with it, because it was like he had a rooster on a sticker, ..  .. He got, you know, I think he called it a fanny pack with a rooster on. And it was like, I don't feel anything.  That doesn't make me feel anything. Yeah. I don't want to be a walking billboard for that guy's brand, right?

10:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, A, I don't want to be a walking billboard.

10:15 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I'm not wearing that, right? I can see you would, but I'm never going to wear that. But B is like, you had the thought to make it, but it's not that much.  It's not, personality isn't really in that. Whereas you making stuff, whether it's making stuff that then gets printed or whether it's like touching, making it, that's a different thing altogether, I think.  It makes me feel something. Yeah.

10:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for saying that. you know, sometimes, and that's how I felt when I first came across your work.  Sometimes I meet people online and then I actually get to talk to them. Like, we've been talking for 10 minutes.  And I do have a sense that it's very easy that we have so many things we agree on, that conversation turns into like a nod, not a snusseless, but like a nod that's like, yes!  So I feel very seen by what you say. And I've sent your case studies to a lot of people.  I think they're really good. And I think there's a certain way of looking at the world and a fascination of the metagame, of being paid for being, you know, an outlier in your field.  That's really, you know, for a long time, that was, and the thing is that I had no agency over it.  I think I was just too passive about it. But for a long time, that was like the number one question on my mind, like, how the hell did university professors become airport book successes?  I mean, surely there's an industry to this. And I'm like, oh, what's the industry? But I didn't do anything with it.  But I think it's a question that you probably... And so this thing you're saying about the physicality, like your office, the color of your office, the things you put behind you, right?  That little tray with stationery that you've had. I mean, yeah, I just keep saying, yes, yes, one of us, one of us, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:25 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Yeah, no, that's cool. So what's your work on right now, right? So you're working on the workshops with people.

12:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, so we've reached the end of the package. It was a four-meeting package. Maybe we did five. It's actually, I mean, something I'm improving on myself, which is packaging these things better.  It's a bit ironic, and I feel, what's the name, self-conscious about it. I think workshops are great for productizing things, but making the workshop is very difficult to productize because it's super contextual.  You don't make a car factory inside of a car factory. need a factory factory, right? And so with Oren, we did, I think, four or maybe five sessions.  Oren was challenging. It's very clever and very precise. And I was like, I was like, is he liking this?  And then he would say something that's confirmed that he liked it, but it's really paying attention, it's really serious.  And I think I've enjoyed the experience because it really stretched me to like, do I trust the things I'm saying?  And yes, but I did, I did work with him. And he kept mentioning how he was working with you as well in that, I think, more strategic.  I think what you're doing with him is more strategic.

13:58 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Yeah. My work with Oren is kind of different to most of the other clients. So with most of the other clients, with Oren, it's kind of like, well, I say the other clients.  So the other clients are kind of, there's two different types right now, but usually they have like, like, they've been doing this thing for some time, for a few years.  They're not, amongst their peers or amongst people they've worked with, they're recognized as elite, but maybe they're not broadly recognized amongst the market.  I mean, someone said to me, two people said to me, like, you know, when they kind of have an inquiry call or whatever, it's like, I want to be the David C.  Baker of my niche, right? Do you know David C. Baker? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you get that. So basically, that's kind of what they want to be.  They're kind of the expertise, they have the chops, but maybe they haven't packaged it as best they could, or they're not telling stories as the best way they could, or there's pieces missing.  And so we'll have this initial period where it's like, all right, I'm going to go through everything, I'm to pull everything out of your head.  And 12 weeks, then we're going to map it out, and we're going to figure out what your content plan is, or what your key signature pieces are for the short to medium term.  And then after that period, it's like, okay, I think there's a book here, there's a keynote there, then you can, all these 30 different sections during the book can be individual podcast episodes, or things in place, whatever.  And then it's kind of, all right, and now I can help you deliver it or not. I don't usually make it, but I don't make it for a collaborator as a producer type thing.  So Oren's a bit different because Oren's more kind of ad hoc. He's not writing a book or anything like that.  It's not like a big strategy piece as such. But yeah, with most people, it's like based on the, they might have already written a book, right?  They've already got an advisory practice. They're probably doing, well, one client, a couple of clients are doing over a million type of thing.  But the market doesn't necessarily, they're not as famous, well-known as they should be, basically. And they're kind of, expertise is incredible.  It's just, they're not really, they're not telling it. They're not telling the story as well as they could. So that's kind of, that's kind of what I do.  And like I say, it's a little bit different with Oren. Because it's more like article to article or post to post.  I think Oren's earlier...

17:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you rephrase that? Oh, sorry.

17:09 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I think it's more like with Oren, it's more, okay, let's work on this article and then this article and that post.  Oren's not as... Oren's been a fractional CMO for a year or so, I think. So it's a little bit different to someone that's been doing it for 10 years, say.

17:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:29 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Do you get me? No, no, I get you, I get you. So, yeah, so that's how I know Oren.  It's through... He found one case study and then... Right now, most of my clients come from case studies, so I don't have that many.  I haven't got the capacity for any clients, but... The ones that I have, either directly or indirectly... I've come through a case I've study.  I've And often the person, case study was about shared it, and then that kind of gets on the radar of, or like one person, someone who's might come through, Blair Enns, shared, I am working on a case study with Blair Enns, but it's not come out yet.  But he shared to his kind of private email list one of my case studies and what I'm doing, and then I got an inquiry that looks like it's going to convert on the back of that.  So not many people see them, but they have a big impact on my business.

18:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. For sure. And sorry, I think my reaction interrupted you. Please, please proceed. No, no, I've finished. I've finished.

18:54 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  No, okay. So when you...

19:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the Billy Bros one? Is that how you pronounce it? Billy Bros? Yeah, Billy Bros.

19:06 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Well, I think he says Bros, but I don't know.

19:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Billy Bros. The one was really interesting to me as well, because I think my first contact with, huh, this guy knows his stuff, he's selling it, and he's not sleazy, and I trust him, was Tiago Forte.  With a second brain thing. And I was like, I wonder what's the meta of this? Again, always this thing.  But I didn't really know how to search for it. I was just kind of orbiting that world, following him before it was too big, that kind of thing.  But I didn't get to see, because I have this intuition that oftentimes there's like really... Yeah, see. So let's see.  We're we're not looking for it. You Not just teams, but like very outside, outlier people helping these guys do these sort of things, right?  Which I think it's kind of where I put you. And seeing that was like, oh, okay, yeah, yeah. So that's, again, to the answer of the airport book industry complex.  So, and when you describe the cases now, you've told me this before, but I didn't, it didn't register. Which is like, people get involved in the creation of the cases, right?

20:34 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  So it's not, I mean, it seems to be a bit, yeah, I mean, so we're not, they do get involved.  They don't make, they, it is evolving. So when I first started, I was, I didn't have the courage to really approach them.  so the first one I did was growth. And Design, and then ProfitWell, and then David Baker, and I kind of made the case study.  I thought, all right, I need to make the thing so that I can prove how much I, you know, and then share it with them and say, look, I've got a couple of questions, can email them to you?  I did ask the meeting kind of nervously. I wasn't very forthright with it, if you get me. So there was conversations on email, and that was it.  Then after those few, maybe April Dunford, I got a bit more courage because I was getting good feedback, right?  So I was kind of work, of, there was collaboration, but it wasn't too much. So from then onwards, I then started having conversations.  And now it's like an hour conversation, but what's kind of happened, which has helped my confidence, is on recent conversations, so, you know, with Blair Enns, or I don't, do you know Carl Richards?

22:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Roosevelt as well, but I'm not putting your face to the name.

22:20 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  He does like visual, he was a, he works for, he does visuals on finance for New York Times, Behaviour Gap.

22:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Behaviour Gap? Behaviourgap.com, I think.

22:33 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  So, like, he's a really great guy. You would like him, you would like him. If you like those other guys, I think he'd be, I think he'd be up your street.  But I'd have the call with them, and like, after the call ended, they'd be like, wow, that was amazing.  Like, they'd say, like, so Blair would say, you know, I've done loads of podcasts, I've never done anything like this, like, the research you've done.  And type of stuff, and everything. And it's. We'd have so much fun. then, so then that would get me, they'd say, I'd say, okay, who do you think I should go next?  And they'd say, okay, this person would be great. And it'd be a high part of our person. They'd say, this person would be great.  I'll connect you, right? And so like when I spoke with Carl recently, we got on a call and he was like, yeah, I spoke to Blair.  I said, Blair, what do I need to do? Yes, he said, you don't have to do anything. Like Liam will come with questions.  But that just gives you confidence, right? Because I respect these people. hugely admire. So then now, it's got the case studies getting, I think, again, better because I'm with Billy Brose.  Same with Ryan Dice. Because I do, I go through all the podcast material that's public.

23:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's insane amount of work.

23:54 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  It's a lot of work, right? Yeah. I've found ways to do it that are less time consuming than they were.

24:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is a lot of work, right?

24:04 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  And when I did, I promised myself to do six, and it was like, I'll do six, and then see what happens.  And then I just said, okay, that was worth it. But yeah, so I'll do that. And then I'll have, and then I'll prepare questions.  So it's like, I'm not asking you stuff that I've already found. Yes. I'm asking you stuff to go deeper on stuff.  So it's more interesting conversation with them, because they're getting asked questions that have been asked. I'm going into it.  Like, I'm coming to it. I don't need an intro. I don't need any of that. I'm going to come in and ask the deeper questions.  So 60 minutes of getting real depth. then when it gets into case study, I've got material that's not been got before.  So, yeah.

24:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I love how much of a flywheel it seems to be. And it's really good work. You know, do you know that YouTube show where the interview celebrities eat hot wings?

25:08 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Yeah, I only started watching it recently, but I do like it, yeah. I forgot what it's called, but it's good.

25:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't remember. First We Feast or something like that. that's it. First We Feast, yeah. And if you've watched it, you've probably noticed that the celebrities often are like, oh, this is a really good question.  Nobody ever asks me questions like this. It's like a pattern. Because they didn't start with as big celebrities as they have now, right?  The guy has a talent for it. And a big part of that, I think, is the research. I appreciate that.

25:41 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I listened to a podcast with, do you know Louis Theroux? Have you ever heard of him? No. He's a documentary maker in England.  He's quite well-known in England. Can you repeat the name, please? Louis Theroux, T-H-E-R-O-U-X. So he has a good podcast, and he interviewed the guy because he has been on the Hot Wings thing, and then he was interviewing that guy.  And so he has an interview, which was a good interview, actually, with that guy, and they're talking about how he got started and research and everything.  At first, it was tricky because he would tell people the concept of the show, and they would think it's going to be this.  It's not at all – he's this very thoughtful – he's very thoughtful, quietly spoken, like you said, does all his research.  The title of the show and the theme of the show doesn't match that if you don't know it, if you don't know it.  So people were coming on thinking it was – he couldn't get some people, and some people would come on thinking it was a completely different thing until he, like you say, he built the reputation now.

26:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's amazing. I that you have a talent for finding this behind-the-scenes stuff. I will watch that interview. There's so much.  There's so much. Do you know...

27:16 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  We can have another, because I've got another caller in a minute, but we could book another call in, if you fancy.  Oh, for sure. Absolutely.

27:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I try to keep these first ones short, because they always want more. So, yes, let's do that. Because I'd like to hear more from you.

27:33 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I've been speaking too much on this, so I want to hear more. enjoy hearing you talk, that's fine.

27:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, I'll send you a link for a longer one that's also easier to find time slots for. Yeah, that'd be cool.  That'd be cool. Thank you. Thank you. I'm really glad we got the chat.

27:47 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Before we go, is there anything else that you... Is there anything I can help you with, or you were thinking about to go out for three minutes?  Is there anything that I can help you?

27:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hmm... Okay, thank you for asking. No, I didn't come with an agenda, so that's not clear. I'm sure there are things, but I don't have an answer in three minutes.  No, that's cool.

28:09 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  I just wanted to check if I could help you with anything.

28:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you have anything in mind that maybe I could... No, no, no. Nothing.

28:16 - Liam Curley (liamcurley.co.uk)
  Nothing at all. No, it was good to me. If you send me that link, I'll book another one, and we can have a bit longer.  For sure, for sure.

28:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll do. I don't want to hold you for the next one. This was really good. Thank you. Yeah, likewise.
