0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No How are you doing on your just coming in right now meeting room So for the delay I was Yeah, no one is Hello, you found it going in great Love you on this screen, but I don't know the camera work from this.  Is there a camera on this? Yeah, yeah, of course You see, you well, yeah, you know, this is my camera here.  I was trying to turn the camera in This thing, but I don't know if I know how to do that Otherwise Yeah, we can and five to I guess You  So, yeah, I only have the whiteboard here, so that's good because we can draw out processes to have them if needed.

1:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If there is a camera. I think it works.

1:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  What about the dual camera?

1:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  me see if I can... No, it's not there.

1:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Okay, great. So, how should we start in terms of the kind of... We have an hour, we're like a little bit less than an hour because I need to leave.  In terms of mapping out the third party management process.

1:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Jao, do you want to... Sure. I might do it here as well. It's okay, just keep it. So, thank you for being here for this.  Basically, we want to understand how you think about this task, right? So, perhaps the best... of starting to think about that is can you remember like a specific time that you needed to do this third-party management for a specific third party and just walk us through how that went, how that task arrived at your desk and how was that processed and then we start to drill down on specifics.

2:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay so what I've done mostly recently is suppliers. So we have different processes for business partners and suppliers and customers.  On supplier side what we do is the supply chain is identifying potential suppliers and when they have identified three that they it's possible to record this.  it okay?

2:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Record this.

2:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This also we can also map it easier. So when the supply chain team has identified three potential suppliers, they send out requests for information, including our self-assessment questionnaire, which is the most relevant for the compliance function.  In this questionnaire, there are different topics, so Scopo supply, general business information, contact information, etc.

3:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then there's section H&C, quality, business integrity, human rights, sanctions and sustainability.

3:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we try to capture information in one document so the supplier doesn't have to fill out a lot of different documents.

3:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What kind of document is a word? Document or MS forums or Excel? Excel.

4:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then the supplier sends an Excel sheet back to us filled in with the necessary documentation. What we often see is that they have not submitted all the requested information and documentation that we need to understand and assess their maturity level when it comes to compliance.

4:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then the communication starts and me as compliance don't have direct communication with the supplier.

4:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I send my questions to the responsible supply chain person. Either if it's not that many questions we can take it over email.  If there's a lot of questions then we have started to have these meetings with suppliers instead to ask all our questions and to get a better understanding of their situation.

4:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And these meetings... I'm also putting my own posts here. So these meetings, do they have like a script for them or it's more ad hoc kind of thing?

5:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's ad hoc and it's tailored because the questions will be very specific to the information that we have received.

5:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so if it's a little... not a lot of information missing is email, if that's a little bit more contextual information goes into a meeting.

5:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but the weakness in this process is that the supplier can untouch what they want or what they have.

5:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So sometimes they say that yes, we have a third party due to this process, they don't attach the person's evidence.

5:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we can of course dive into that in the meeting, but if it was a more dynamic you can be like...

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You say, yes, you can't move on unless you attack. Exactly.

6:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's a good question there. Yeah. And what's the name of...

6:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's different kinds of mistakes, right? For instance, one mistake is to forget or to not include any document.  And the different kind of mistake is including the wrong kind of document. But I could imagine that maybe happens as well sometimes.  Oh yeah, we've hired some guys and they send you some PDF that has nothing to do with the thing that you've asked.  Yeah. If you could guess, which one do you think happens the most? do not, they're not attaching things or are they attaching the wrong thing?

6:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I want to add the third option, but they're not attaching things, but also that they don't understand what's expected of them.

6:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Tell me more about that, please. So, for example, human rights due diligence, we have the Norwegian Transparency Act.

7:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  to the guidelines.

7:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's pretty clear what companies should do in order to be compliant with those, with the Office Loan, for example, the Norwegian Transparency Act.

7:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And the guidelines are pretty clear on the steps that companies need to take to do human rights due diligence.  But in the discussions that I've had with suppliers, they are completely blank of this. Of course, they say yes, human rights, of course, we protect them and is not an issue at all, but when it comes to the actual assessments of their potential impact, they haven't done it and they don't understand what's expected.

7:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you. I understand that. Okay, so I'll repeat back to you the main aspect. So there's many kinds of third parties, but right now we've discussed  more of a supplier kind of situation. Someone identifies street potential suppliers, which I assume is not the compliance function.  And then who sends the request for information? Is the compliance function or is the procurement? Procurement. Okay. Okay. And then procurement receives these these documents and procurement is also probably not a specialist on these documents.  They receive something, they send, they just forward it to compliance. Is that accurate?

8:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

8:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then compiling the specialist looks into this stuff and realize, oh, there's several mistakes here, things that need to be corrected.  And, and then there's this back and forth to correct things. But you don't have direct access to the suppliers or the prospective suppliers.  They're not suppliers yet, right? And there's this back and forth, and there's probably a little bit of confusion over the image.  This takes a little bit longer. When we're talking about this kind of processes, it's always interesting to think about the two extremes, the ones that did it really well and the ones that went really bad.  Any of these specific things comes to mind, anything, you don't need to share names, but any specific situation that comes to you that was really fluid, went really well, and another one that really did not.

9:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Only for this phase? Yeah, for this one, yeah.

9:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

9:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  For this process, for the vendor, yeah. No, I think, well, when there are not a lot of follow-up questions, it goes more smoothly because they have attached what we want to see.  And the challenging part is when they... don't understand what we want to see and we try to explain and email back and forth back and forth and we don't get the information that we actually ask for.  don't know. Sorry, in terms of like the timing like for one that goes smooth how long does it usually take like from the first email and getting it versus the ones that you know reiterate like is it weeks or is it days weeks like for the bad ones but then for the ones that are pretty fast it's like days.  Yeah, then it's the assessment itself doesn't take more than a couple of hours and then yeah. Then you're done and then yeah.  And what percentage are usually on the like very quick an hour done versus like like 10% or that's like 10% so 90% is like yeah.  But that's also linked to the maturity of our supply chain and who our suppliers are. Yeah, so for example if we have a more established global company.  Yeah, we get what we ask for and so it's a context also needs to be taken into consideration.

11:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can imagine that for the ones that take longer, you might be like the first company that asks them for this stuff.  So you are kind of, you are the, it's not a good expression, the tip of the spear in terms of this, they've never interacted with this and then they see you and it's like, yeah, yeah, we have those documents, but they don't have them.  Okay.

11:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So when it comes to anti-corruption, for example, the experience is that companies are more responsive to that because that's been around, yeah.  The G side, the G side has been around a little bit longer to the E and the S more new.

11:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And how many, and why did the supply, when does procurement bring you in?

11:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  guys have a

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do they just select the number they're going to give you or is it there's a qualification, right?

12:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like if it's if the supplier is like this, you do all of them like in other companies We do all of them.  So So As an example yesterday, we were awarded Celsius project. Yeah a big project But then the procurement process has started long before yesterday.  Yeah So we have already set out RFIs and asked for information and the self-assessment has been issued and reviewed I'm not sure if I answered the question Yeah, no, but so it's every kind of supplier that you would like because some companies go by like, okay We only do suppliers if they're In this geography with this high risk within this and then we don't have the other low risk ones Some companies say no matter what we do all of them, you know, but then like which was yeah So we take a risk based approach.  You guys have a risk based approach. Yeah, okay But often we end up in the high risk because so we have this matrix We should help us put we should help us set the new diligence level  But often we, so in the matrix, if the supply falls within, so that is the highest or the most risky part that determines the level.  So if we have, yeah, if one of the suppliers and in the highest column, just for one of that, yeah, we check, we will do that.  So do you understand that, like I don't know, I'm going to give a weird example like Nokia, like on the phone.  But let's say Nokia is usually like low risk, but let's say they have like one operation and I don't know, Myanmar that like doing weird mining and that becomes like a high risk, then the whole thing becomes high risk.  Like, so that's kind of how they take it.

13:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's like, if you have any kind of high risk criteria.

13:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we, in our tool, we kind of do that.

13:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We kind of say like, we do a different type of risk and say, you know, based on spend the geography and whatever, these are your high risks.

13:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then you go through that questionnaire process and that, but it seems like quite similar. They might, you guys might have a different risk at that.  the title of different things but the questionnaire follow-up with the questionnaire answering the questions it's kind of the same process that we've kind of designed so far but we might need to update it and we may be able to try out updating it with your questions on some of them to see.  but it could be really easy things that so that triggers the the risk level so for example migrant workers for the social part labor intensive work low-skilled labor and production in a high-risk country yeah those are yeah like the triggers if they answer yes then it kind of goes yeah so like a pre-questionary to even filter them out that's interesting we haven't put that into our tool yet like even like we kind of say that a lot of that goes kind of we're trying to make a simplified version of it right so not like building so many different risk ones because that can be get really complex but saying like okay you've gone online and you've done this and now you've selected these and then now you need to go in and communicate and follow up with them.  But that's, yeah, but we can think about like some kind of risk-tearing on like these are that. Yeah. Because I think our approach will end up giving us problem because it's too, it captures too many suppliers.  And now that we are going into this big project, we will end up doing a lot of these assessments.  Yeah. Which we don't have capacity to do. Yeah. So we can also catch it at the questionnaire one, you send out the questionnaire and then say, okay, my great, like at the questionnaire, yes, but then it's self-assessment questionnaire.  yeah, it's good to think about.

15:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just to make sure I understood correctly, I understand the risk thing. Like if you do one very risky thing that changes your entire risk profile, it cascades to everything else.  But this is the first question questionnaire, the assessment questionnaire. Is it the same? for everyone or you have different assessment questionnaires for different risk profiles, the Excel file that you sent.

16:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So the Excel file we use are for suppliers.

16:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have different questionnaires for business partners, but they're all the same depending on like if you're a supplier you get that one.  It doesn't matter if you're like that.

16:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

16:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah so there's different different questionnaires for the different third party types, but for suppliers it's all the same questionnaire.

16:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it.

16:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So can we perhaps say for another another type of partner? You said business partners for these ones.

16:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So yeah so if we so it depends on the agreement with the company, but agreements that are more integrated than traditional customer supplier contracts you  trigger more due diligence. So, for example, agents, which is the term used in SLB now, that could be all third parties representing the company towards government officials.  Solidistic companies, for example. Or it could be an EPC partner where you're jointly liable.

17:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the project, that can also trigger more due diligence. The process is that we have created this word, if you talk to Mari, because we have the same.

17:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, No, she's like with the due diligence levels, and I'm like, which ones? Okay, but why don't you explain it?  So there's this question, which basically covers many of the same questions as the supplier questionnaire, but it's more detailed.

17:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it asks more information about ownership, but when it comes to the compliance. routines, it's the same. under corruption policy, what do you have in place?

18:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I can share it with you. It's easier than just trying to explain. But then the business partner fill it out, send the documentation, I review it, and then if I follow this, I send those typically directly to the contact person.  Okay, so in this case you have direct access to them.

18:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and the reason why I don't have direct access in the supply chain is because I don't want to.  It becomes too complex and too many people involved. Yeah, okay, so I would assume that this process is, I shouldn't assume, I apologize, but is this process faster or slower than the other one?  I think it's more comprehensive, so I spend more time on it because I should more thoroughly, especially on the sanctions part and there are more questions and more documents to review.  But I think maybe the questionnaire is better. What do you mean better? It's just easier to navigate.

19:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There's one document where all the information is in the supply chain document. You have different tabs in the document.

19:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one is covering business integrity, one is covering human rights, one is covering sanctions, agency, quality and so forth.  So would you, would it be accurate for me to say that it's a more comprehensive, perhaps even more complex process, but it just goes smoother because you have more direct communication, the document is a little  better, you're dealing with people that are more familiar with the topics, is this?

20:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think especially that latter part, because usually if partners are considered, it's typically large global companies that have more dates in place and are more used to answering the questions that we ask.  Interesting, know, that makes sense. That's the player base will be smaller, in the chart.

20:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And they've been pre-selected, right? You wouldn't get into an agreement without, you know, a lot of people making decisions about this.  By the time they, okay, understand.

20:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so for the business partner, so I have this report form that I fill out. So I fill out the risks that I have identified and risk level and recommended mitigating measures.  And that document is sent to the decision makers.

21:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that happens before this process, right? It happens after I've done my assessment.

21:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I fill out a report and send it to the decision makers. That process will change in SLB because they have a system where the due diligence is performed and then you have also the decision makers having assigned certain rules in that system.  So it will be different, but I don't know exactly how it will look.

21:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But do they have a supplier management system yet or not? So now I refer to business partners on the supply chain, so we don't know yet.

21:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We were just told that they have Ariba. I am not familiar with... I don't know the details of it.  It's a procurement tool, I think. But I think it's possible to build in. Yeah, some kind of questionnaire thing into that.  Okay.

21:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. And so all of these documents, do you store them in specific ways? Do they stay in the email?  Is there a tool that if you No, I have a folder for my stuff on the SharePoint site.

22:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  What page is CQ and supply chain are doing?

22:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure.

22:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I know supply chain is storing also. They have their own folder for all the documents that they.

22:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But they're kind of like the same document, because it's like 1XL with all these different sections, right?

22:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So then you kind of saving the same document in your SharePoint.

22:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and then also all the attachments and stuff are also probably there.

22:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They're all there.

22:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, I think so.

22:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Mm-hmm, understood.

22:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. So maybe I can just share my screen. I know it's difficult for you to follow just so you see that.

22:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You know, typing this down.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's probably too small to see from there but we've covered suppliers on a broad level and also partners as an example we've talked about like agents like third parties representing the company to government for instance logistics within within third parties are there others like what are the main categories of third parties like we have suppliers we have agents and what else business partners sometimes it's like a very generic it could include all of this so I like business partners could be everything it's kind of a party so it'd be like agents yeah third parties this order they could sometimes they call a business partner code of conduct or third party code of conduct

24:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Business partners can be the same as third parties. would actually move business partners up to third parties and then yes, suppliers, customers, agents, I guess.

24:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joint ventures maybe?

24:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, business partner can be more integrated contractual agreements where you share.

24:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Certain versions, I don't know. I would put add to it, at least it's like couldn't be like a third party or business partner, like joint ventures or like ownership ones that you've owner, you have partial ownership.

24:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I would call agents intermediaries. Yeah, agents and intermediaries can be the same.

24:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, agents and customers, joint ventures. inquires from the business partner, would be a third party that triggers compliance risk, Just to be sure, from my understanding, you, Anja, suggested that business partners is, despite being broad, it's a type of third party.  Do you understand perfectly?

25:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and that's because SLB has a definition of business partner, and if you fall within that definition with your third party, it triggers due diligence.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's kind of like when we're discussing with like you don't like there are different words for the same thing.  Like some companies would be caught in my in my previous company was called everything business partners.

26:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then it's like, so it's like it's slightly like, yeah, it's more definition, but those are I would say suppliers, intermediaries, customers, joint ventures, like lobbyists, like sales marketing, like, like there's different types of suppliers that would fit within there.

26:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, think those are the bigger ones.

26:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, perfect.

26:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm just trying to capture the language that Anya would use at her company because this could be useful for, for other contexts.

26:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we've discussed suppliers.

26:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we've discussed a little bit of these agents, but the process we've designed down there, it's, I think it's a more generic one, correct?  So we've, we've designed this around agents that they get the word document, which is the questionnaire.

26:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And you, Anya.

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  direct access to them, so is this? I think we have to take a step back because we have in my head, there's three processes, one for suppliers, one for customers, and one for business partners.  Okay.

27:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so that's more business partners then, right? The second one. Yeah.

27:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And then the third one called customers that we have in the end.

27:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. And that will differ from company to company because for some companies, first will be the risk-eater party, and for others, it will be suppliers.  Okay.

27:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But in your case, this is also, this difference is also what happens at your company? So, for customers, we screen them in door jobs.

28:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  kind of a sanctions or background check on the company. Previously we had Moody's. They'd say Dow Jones or like Sanchez yeah exactly.  so then we there so based on the information from the screening tool we added that information into CRM if there were any actions those were given to the sales account responsible to follow up and we didn't do more than that.  So the action goes to the sales people to follow up.

28:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah is there any kind of follow up to see if the sales have actually followed up?

28:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No that's the weakness. That's the weakness of yeah the following up okay. So that's what we talked about last time it would be so great if you had the actions.  Yeah the task management like you could say I followed up yeah like and then like and then they will get notified if they don't get the action within the set timeline but then we're in then we have entered into the agreement right?  All we talked about now is happening before any agreements are in place, but then if we move ahead, yes.

29:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, it could of course have actions also in the due diligence phase.

29:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, I'm part of that, but it's just like the point is I want to like that you've asked people it's it's it's a mechanism a lot of companies like I want you to say, yeah, how do you follow up the task management part is missing.

29:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of basic themes here, we have filling up information is a thing getting the right document thing.

30:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Back and forth is a thing.

30:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Different processes for different apps or different profiles, don't know. And like a task management or documentation, yeah. Management and task management.

30:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And now I know you moved the toy author question. This might be a bit too much, but then let's say you have findings that, okay, the supplier doesn't have a human rights risk assessment process.

30:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

30:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If they are awarded the contract, they need to have their case immediately. So you can also ask or assign task to the supplier that they will have to.

30:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I think that would be part of what we're building is like the task go below

31:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  like to the supplier or to the thing like you need to attach like you did not fill out you didn't fill out the whole questionnaire you need to fill it out for a task to the person to follow up yeah so yeah we would have that in our in our that at least that was the thing like internal task mask and external tasks because then you can go in and check okay in the agreement it says you don't get paid unless you have put this in place yeah and then they if they haven't uploaded it here then yeah that may be trigger a delay in payment for example yeah okay so the thing also be like education i don't know if that's a thing but there's like you know like i need to educate people what things mean i think that's so important you see that without surprise so if there was a question so like an i button that kind of explains

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like what is actually over the word.

32:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, what does human rights include? Yeah, or like some kind of training. Yeah, we're thinking about doing that too.  Yeah.

32:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let's see. We can also show on yet when you feel comfortable, like what we have created already on the third party, because they get some initial thoughts to view, because we have some time.

32:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And before we get into that.

32:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Just make sure are these the main themes in your opinion? Yeah. The main hurdles and obstacles currently. Yeah, just the manual process, know, doing everything in Excel, email, the risk of not documenting the process properly is very high.  Okay, do you have like your own personal tricks? That's the documentation part, general mistakes, but just getting to save all the documents.  I think something about data analytics, in this process you miss a lot of

34:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  about analytics because when everything's in file folders, you're not able to have out of it and that we have looked at 18 automatically.  We saw this in high-risk and we see trends and you're not able to get any data around this.

34:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly.

34:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That also makes the follow-up harder. If when you finish with the deluxe process, if you had a risk level that you set the supply to, it also triggers some actions in the other end.

34:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Your follow-up is harder.

34:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Something about the taste that you're even reporting to the board or management about what you're doing is also very difficult.

34:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if you're going to add a pointer on data analytics, but that's also a nice to have too, just even fixing the process is good.  I see that the data analytics part is missing. Okay, I think I'll put this next to this one. In your experience, Anya, are there any specific, like, personal tricks that you have to keep track of this stuff that they're not like the official process, but they really help you?  Do you have, like, your own way of making notes about these things, reminders that you send yourself? How do manage this?

35:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If there are some important things that I have to remember, I note it down in my to-do list in Teams.  But also, the notes that I'm taking, I'm taking notes in either Word or Excel.

35:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's really old school.

35:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No. I'm saving it in the folder that belongs to that supplier.

36:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is really valuable for us because the way people solve problems on their own it tells us a lot about what's important to them and so these people, whenever we have to start the question, people get a little bit self-conscious like, oh this is very manual, it's not super structured but that's how everyone works so it's a very good answer, thank you.  Okay, do you have like previous experiences doing this sort of work at other companies that you're like, oh my god, I wish we did that thing here?

36:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, I think all the companies have been in have had this type of manual process.

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is quite common. If you don't have a third-party management tool that specializes in this, then a lot of most people are doing it quite manually.

37:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Or maybe they'll send out like an MS forms versus like an Excel file, but it's kind of a similar.  And then so maybe the questionnaire might differ, like depending on each questionnaire, like one, but it's generally, you know, you have a space decision and then you send out a questionnaire and then you try to follow up.

37:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and of course I know what's out there.

37:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  for the dream about having more automatic tools, and that's also why I mentioned that integrity next, that I had filled out, which then I was on the other end filling it out on behalf of the company, but it was so easy.

37:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But then when I think about it, they came back and had follow-up questions on the email. Oh, really?

37:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, after you filled it in. And I don't know if those two processes were connected. Yeah. That they I had those follow-up versions Based on our answers.  I don't think so. I think that they just had other actions But it was why wouldn't they do that via that tool anyways, yeah, yeah Like the central place for communication.  Yeah.

38:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah Mm-hmm and compared to other functions because at the company there's usually more than one department that interacts with the outside world Let's say Do you have any feeling of how other?  Departments do this sort of thing. I think the question behind the question is on my side Do you think there's there are any Organizational Motives reasons for these being so manual for this department and maybe other departments have more mature processes Or do you everybody has so the sales team they are using CRM.

38:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't think they use it to communicate with the customers, our potential customers, but the communication is loaded in the system.

39:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And they give tasks and it seems to work really well.

39:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's a Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

39:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Supply chain is doing it very manual.

39:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  to your question, why if I'm specifically why compliance is not having those tools, I think it's because budgets, first of all, and the lack of understanding or willingness to invest.

39:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And okay, so this will be a selfish question on our part. When you say lack of understanding, because for you that as someone that works on this, it's very clear that the advantage of having a better tool for this, It would improve your quality of your day immediately.  for them is a little bit different I suppose. What do you think is difficult for decision makers to understand about this process that we could help you explain the value of this?  I don't think they understand the steps that I take in the assessment, what I check and why I check it.  They don't understand the scope of work.

40:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think there's just this expectation that just fix it and get it done.

40:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

40:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I'm only one person, right? you have a whole supply chain team that doesn't have a system.

40:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Of course they should be prioritized before me, maybe.

41:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

41:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Thank you for indulging us because this is useful in terms of positioning, messaging and all of these things that help explain what we do.  Perfect.

41:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How do you feel after explaining a little bit of this process?

41:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you think there are questions you were expecting us to make you, and we didn't make? No.

41:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Maybe around the visual presentation of the tool, but we don't have to do that now. But it would be interesting to, because as I last time in my head I have these four boxes that cover different topics and the surprise up to you.  Yeah. I would like maybe, I don't know, the only question I go show the tool because. We're still developing it, but it would be good to get your insight on some of it.  This is our tool, a compliance map, going into supplier. So I had split it up into suppliers, third party, internal, because of this understakeholder management, not the business partner, and then other external, also thinking about the transparency act where they ask about internal and external.  Lately, I've been thinking just deleting these boxes and just calling this third party and putting everything in there. I'm still deciding, but the kind of, oh no, there's one wrong, because we're also developing this right now, so, so if we go to go back, they're playing around with this right now.  There's a set up guide. Let's see if I can Sorry, this is not a good testing right now. Oh, they just like literally they just disabled this because we're launching this and I asked them to disable this so people can't go into that section, but I wonder if we just missed the disabling part right now as we as we launch.  They literally just did this, but I just had it there. Okay. Yeah. yeah. But I'm frustrating. Yeah. And there we had like kind of the steps you go through your risk process like looking at I wonder if I can get a screenshot of this, but we go like, you know, go through the list offline based on these criteria is looking at your spend and then saying like what is the top spend and then what is the geography of their headquarters and then what is their industry that they work in and then have then you've done this offline and then you say these are your 30 that you want to follow and then the 30 you upload to the tool and you send out a questionnaire that's already pre-created to them and then they respond and then depending on the response.

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Once you decide, are you going to have a meeting with them?

44:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Can you close them out? Do you need to follow up? And then that starts the process. That's kind of how we did that in there.  But I think they just literally just did it because we're about to launch this part. So I wanted, as we open the tool, the other parts aren't done.  So I said, don't let them go in while we just want them to look at that. And they must have just done that because now we can't.  I was just trying to show you there. So yeah, that's OK. But yeah, so the policies and procedures are getting.  It's like documents needing employees sign off, and then documents just for your internal management. So if you wanted to do that, and then environmental ones, social ones, governance ones.  And then that's kind of how we're sitting in it. But you'll have access to this part to be able to test it out.  And then did you get access to the team site? created a team site for you. OK, let me check because I think.  I was having trouble. That was the thing on the team side.

45:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was having trouble accessing like your SLB wasn't allowing it in, but then like your other one did.

45:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So here like your curve and capture.

45:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  have the wrong name for them.

45:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It was in here and I added you to this one. But then maybe. Yeah. It's under this one here, Anya, but you're out of office.  Could I try to invite your SLB one, but it wouldn't let me invite it.

45:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then I will have to log in and I can't do that. Okay.

45:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Maybe I can share with people this way. I think, otherwise, we can find another way of doing it too.  I just remember trying to add here. I think it should work. I just log in here.

46:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, because I tried to add the LOB one and it didn't.

46:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm to try again, see if it works. Yeah, you can't share this channel with people from this org. No, the answer.  Yeah, but I was able to add your carbon capture one. that was the answer. It's called ARCA Carbon Capture.  It's called customer success. And you should only be able to see the ARCA Carbon Capture one, not the other ones.  You don't have it? Strange. Okay, I need to... I can maybe resend it. I'll share it with people. Yeah, let me try again.  And try resending it to you, yeah, otherwise, maybe send me stuff on email and then we can also try to do it and then we can also upload it to the tool there.  yeah, that one, yeah, that one, that one, you're out of office, but I don't know why. me try again.  Okay, but I, but Joe, do you feel like you have enough if we need to kind of revisit our authority to see if it matches what the process that Anya has shared?

47:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so, I think so, even if I suspect that there's a few key aspects that if we improve them a little bit, the level one of effect.

47:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and I can maybe share that. They can't be linked to channel. Oh, I have another question, Anja.

48:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I need to make use of this.

48:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So you've mentioned these other experiences where you were on the other side, just using the Integrity Next, I think.  Right?

48:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

48:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So did you receive like emails from Integrity Next like, oh, there's something you should fill in. Just click this and you can go there.  Yeah. So that happened two years ago. And then a year after, there was a new email saying, oh, your ISO certificate has expired.  You need to upload it. And then I just pass it on to the agency team and then they can log in and upload in the system.  But for you to fill in the, this is very important.

48:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you. For you to fill in the information, you said there were two different emails, right? One of them was like a year later, oh, this is, it's finished.  You need to do it again. Yeah. But when it asked you for the information for the first time, could you just click on the link  Go straight to that page that you needed to go.

49:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think so I can check Or do you need a login or set up account or did it just take you straight in?  Good question.

49:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me And Were you told that it's coming or did you worry that it would be spam or something?  No, it came to be someone else You Yeah, so it was this email saying their business partner and yeah we need to ask you some questions and then it says register and start assessment.

50:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'll click on it because I don't remember what I did. Okay, so it did have you register in the beginning and went into a registration thing.

50:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then I probably had to grant my own user a create password.

50:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, I don't want to do it now but that's good to know because we're trying to see like how much are we able to get people to access the system without having to register because I worry that like you and you gave people a set of registered like this is one extra task that people don't want versus just sending them a questionnaire and then yeah them filling in the questionnaire but then there has to be a way to track it so it's either a simple sign-on or like some kind of way to get that so yeah yeah figure out the balance of like making everybody register and get a password versus yeah it's very easy to get the code that is so when you click on the link and  you you're filling in your email and then you have to ask for code yeah and then just send it to email and then you can fill instead of like filling out your number and yeah exactly like doing a magical link gel versus like having them go in and having to read register themselves yeah makes sense but yeah but thank you and you have to run you had to leave it five minutes early but shall any other questions or no no no this this was really good yeah yeah but i think that's the essence very easy access to the system yeah we'll we'll help a lot already and yeah yeah no this is good but thank you for your taking the time because actually i think we're pretty close i think we need to build in some communication function within our tool but otherwise we have kind of the questionnaire the follow-up so it'd be good but i'm i send you the teams if are you able to drop some of the documents like the questionnaire into the teams and we could see if we could try to like digitalize that version or find a version of that yeah but that document is not the best thing  So, I'll give you a but you don't have something to work with, but there are... Yeah, maybe we can use that as a way as like, how do we tell you to file this or simplify it to the clean question on this, simplify the questionnaire, and we can have a discussion.  I did have a first look. Yeah, because what's integrity next, if I remember correctly, when you started out filling questions, you were high-risk and then you moved down to the low-risk.  If you filled that all the questions, you were in the low-risk. That's a good way of trying to encourage people to fill in all the information because you go down in this level.  Okay, cool. All right. Thank you for your time. Yeah.

52:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Shall we have a few minutes?

52:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  we can stay online before I jump into my next book.

52:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bye.

52:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Thank see you later.

52:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

52:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'll talk to you later. Bye.

52:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

52:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think, shall we? could be good to...

52:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

52:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We could think about how to break this down and maybe... I know they disabled the tool. because I'm showing it but I think we have the figma somewhere.  think like eggs had done the figma, you know what I mean? Like there's a figma that they used to build the tool with and it could be good to review that with maybe Romeo and understand okay, you know, doesn't match with the process and what needs to be done.  But we could also have another conversation with Mari, the other from Aqua Horizons, like she went through the whole process with me so I feel bad having to do it again.  But it's yeah, but we can see. Did you record it with her? I feel like I did record it.  Because you usually have this, I think I've received like read AI things from you. if the read AI thing was on, I didn't have a recap, Mari, January 23rd.  Let me think.

53:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm just trying to find out other meetings.

53:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  was

54:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but I think right now, if you have the Mario stuff, we can try to do it quickly. If you don't have the Mario stuff, I can just whip out something quickly here that looks like a draft.  I think that's really important because when people see things that are too finished, they don't expect that they're done.

54:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So just whip out something on Excalibur, which is...

54:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I share my screen with you? Yeah. So Excalibur is this thing, which is really good to make it look like, oh, this is just draft.

54:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And people react to this well. So we could just make something very quickly, not of the screens, but of the process.  the process like BPMN and so I think that's totally fine I think it's a my only thing is like we do have something already created so like how much of like what we are existing created can we just modify the process to match and I think it's actually pretty similar because we like have a questionnaire we send out the questionnaire but we don't have the rest of the flow really the questionnaire comes back there's a communication flow there's a few slides are missing but it could be good to draw it out first and and then we can map it to what we have and then we can see what needs to be drawn or change from our existing process I can't seem to find I need to go through my inbox it was in third party ah third party work through right there let's see if I can third party let's see if I recorded it third party walk through I don't think I recorded it because I think I did it in person  And I did take some photos, timeline walk-through. me see. I need to find it, but I have a feeling I didn't record it, because I think I was, I met her in person on it.  Third party walk-through. It was on December 16th. Mari, Abby, third party walk-through. Let see I find it. Abby, thank you for all the results.  Oh, I don't see it. I don't think, I don't think we had. Yeah, I don't think we recorded that one, unfortunately.

56:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do have a picture from it, but I don't know if that's going to really.

57:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  help you and if you have it just send it on Slack or something, okay? Yeah, I did take a picture of it and I might be able to maybe we can in our, I'll send you the picture maybe in our later on session.  I need to go to a meeting, but in our later on session, I can walk you through the picture.  You can do that. Okay. Thank you. need to jump up.

57:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Thanks. Bye.

57:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Bye.
