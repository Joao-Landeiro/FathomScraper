0:03 - A L
  I have a question because I was just talking to Yvonne about this, do you know how to make those two boards, like design board and development board, is it a template on JIRA?  I don't know how they made it, because every time I try to open a new project, it doesn't look like that, but we're just wondering maybe it's a template for project management or a different thing, so when you're trying to create a new project?  Yeah, when you create a new project, it's like you have different templates, but it doesn't allow you to, it doesn't look like that, so when you add the marketing budget, you just have three different ones, rather than you have one with a design element and within the same one, they just create one for each one.  So maybe we're thinking by the end of it, maybe it's a special one around project management that allows you to have more than one, we're just trying to figure out, because I would want to do something similar for operations, and have all  the different things that in operations in one we couldn't figure out how to do it yeah but it's okay we're just looking at it earlier but um it's Yvonne here I can't see um no I was just talking to hello hello no uh but basically Abby I think I think it's just uh when you create a new one we're here projects great project uh just use a Kanban I think it's the easiest one yeah yeah when I do Kanban I can get into it but then it's not so easy to filter like you know I wanted to have one for like you know sales and marketing or leads and like and and that and it's hard it doesn't have like what you guys have on development side which is like you know design on one and then development on the other so then you can kind of go between them but um yeah so that like you end up making one Kanban I've like I've tried so many  Over the last few days I've deleted like in the deletion like there's like 12 and they're they're deleted but it's okay.  But yes, even I was just asking shall be new like the thing that we're discussing. Yeah, it's okay. We'd like to move on like as it'll take some time anyway.

2:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, so Let's go into the review stuff create screens for approval process.

2:25 - A L
  You're seeing my my tab, right?

2:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this was related to when a policy is a sent for approval. There was this map here. then Romeo, we've made drafted this out and then Romeo made this here.  I'm sharing the tab. Romeo, if you want to expand something or if you want to need to expand something just Just like you know is on the latest right This one is this the right link.  Yeah

3:01 - A L
  I'm just looking at it right now, because I don't see it until then I've been back to the meeting as well.  don't know, Yvonne, if you have any questions, I'm loading it right now.

3:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or maybe you can show it under it, yeah. Okay. So this was the send for review, in case you need to approve, in case you can approve on your own.  Okay, yeah. Yeah. You can approve directly or add a group program.

3:32 - A L
  Yeah, that looks good.

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you can just type in their emails, sending to them, and then they'll do it on their side. But I think, if I have any questions, that's all I to Yeah.

3:51 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay, so let me explain here, so Flux would be like this, I've sent the cop drivers here, and it was sent to them.  Okay, this would be the email template that people would receive to approve.

4:17 - A L
  Then if they review and co-approve the policy, where do they go and write that I approve it? Is that on the bottom, I acknowledge this policy, the one next to it?  Okay, down here is where they would approve. Like on the bottom you go, I acknowledge this policy, wouldn't it be I approve this policy?  Or like there should be two buttons like saying I approve this policy or I do not approve, you know, please review and send it back to me or something like that.  There should be like two buttons. Approve this policy and then I do not approve this policy.

5:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Please review and send again or something like that Okay, let's think about this so if they do not approve and then send them an email say please review Probably they'll ask for comments, right?  They'll send some comments on it, right?

5:20 - A L
  yeah, possibly or like I think we had like a Comment part like the review process you see on top?  Yeah, they're like that, but I don't know where you would put a comment in to say like not approve I just thinking for the MV person you could just be like I don't approve and then they can send it via email Even that was what like hydro rain was saying that you can do it that way for the MVP But some place to track it.  I don't know Yvonne. What is the fastest way for development for something without the comment?

5:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  So you can just approve or check But I would like to start from the beginning can we start with on the beginning with the flow?  so you have a policy you Let's just want to have See if everything is okay, so you're here then you request to have to request a reviewer, right?

6:06 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Yeah.

6:07 - A L
  Okay, so you do what you click Yeah, so I don't know I acknowledge in the bottom it doesn't seem to make sense there it would be like I acknowledge this policy or It would be because are we adding now on additional stuff every in the portfolio as far as I'm sure we are adding the review step Right.

6:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  So before this moment you have to have a review, right?

6:35 - A L
  Yeah, you can go to approve or co-approve like I approve This one or I didn't like I need somebody to Like so this approve and add a code approver could almost be like at the bottom of the first one is like I either I approve it Or I need a co-approver to to move on so Right like on the first one is like I already approve it or I need a co-approver so then it goes  and sends it to the co-approver.

7:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think in the first one, you can suggest something different, because we have this flow of the, I can approve it directly or I can ask for a co-approver, right?

7:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  Ah, when you click, you do model pop-up.

7:15 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Is that what you're saying?

7:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes.

7:17 - Romeu Rodrigues
  So maybe.

7:18 - A L
  Policy, yeah.

7:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe. Yeah.

7:25 - A L
  So maybe.

7:26 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

7:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We could just set this button for policy ready for approval. And then when I click here, yeah, I would get into the flow of deciding how to approve this, right?

7:40 - A L
  Just to separate things.

7:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

7:43 - A L
  Or we can just skip a step and just put it all in the same one, being like, I approve the policy or add a co-approver, like so then it's on the same one.  You know what I mean? Taking this thing and put it in here? Yeah, I kind of, I approve this policy.  or like send it for approval and then it goes to send for review part. Or you can do yours too, it doesn't matter.  don't know if it's easier for you or what's better.

8:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  Without the additional part, guess it's not that too different. It's I would say pretty similar in the complexity.

8:18 - A L
  So Jao, if you think that it should have a pop-up then yeah let's change the bottom of that text that says like ready for like click here if you're ready to approve or something like that.  But then my only thing is like the reason why I thought it would be nice at the front page is that some people might be like already being like I can't approve this, I can't approve this, I need someone else to approve so they might freak out and then it opens up and they're like oh yeah I can co-approve whereas like if you have it on the first page then they already know like it makes them feel better because they know that they they they can either close it or have a co-reviewer.  So it doesn't have that anticipation of like I shouldn't be I shouldn't be confirming anything because I don't know you know like so that's the only thing.

9:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that makes sense okay yeah sure so the decision here is to bring this question here this stuff under here yeah like I'm ready I'm ready to approve this policy or like I need another person to review it it can be as simple as two buttons for now I think we don't need okay yeah and then when it's like if they want a co-approver then it goes into your your thing okay that's so nice

10:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Or, or here, even at bottom, it would additional proof. We already have this the of this stage, right? Uh-huh, thinking.

10:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so Romeo makes a very good point, think. If we have these elements of the approver, uh... Uh, because people look at these and they can see the approvers, right?  And it would make sense that the place where they can see the approvers is the place where they can also add other approvers, right?  So it would look... So it would make sense to perhaps have a button here, a plus, where we can add approvers here.

10:49 - A L
  Yeah, yeah, either one. It could either add it in the immediate here, or they can have, like... I don't mind, either I confirm it or no, I don't.

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  not the added immediately in this one or they have one step that pops up and this says okay you know since you said since you collected you clicked we needed another user then then you need to add but I I think either way but I don't know Ivan what is better for you I think if that button will open the same thing as the bottom button will do that's fine with us yeah actually not not not no additional work basically almost yeah if it doesn't come out so and I think it should so yeah because it's very easy to imagine that it says João this is you like literally this is you and and then there's an option to add another prover and this would both give visibility who is in the process and also is the anxiety of oh I don't want to be alone in this right so I like Romeo's suggestion I think we'll have to have both

12:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Since I think users are focused mainly on the bottom button for progressing with this document. So basically whatever you do at the bottom is moving it to the next status or something.  So I think we will probably need to have both in a way that users will possibly won't see that approver at the top right.  And also another thing is how Michael this is not a question. How does it behave? So if I don't add any approvers then I need to approve it.  But if I add another approver like Zhao and I now are approvers, does that mean that both of us need to approve it for the policy to go further into the approved state?  Or it's just one approval is enough?

12:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have a question for you.

12:47 - A L
  I think it's it could be one approver is enough as long as you don't need another like it could be like I am just the coordinator.  It's not up to me to approve. The CEO of it was all policy So if he approves it, then we're all good, right?  I'm okay ready to go. Other ones are like, I'm the secondary approver, like, and I need this person to approve.  But like, know, like, it could be like, know, I approve the policy is ready to go out, or I need an approver and that person, you know, it says okay, and then you can just be like deployed.  So it really depends, I would say. Okay, so we need to be flexible there.

13:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's fine. But can I ask? You can. So ready for approval will be, okay, I approve it, let's go deploy it.  That's like, let's move forward. what if I don't do the other button you wrote down? I don't think that fits what we were saying here.  So I don't approve this version. I don't think that's what we need here. need. I need someone else to approve this for me.  That's what we need. Something like that. Yeah, you're going to be like, I'm ready to approve the policy and that could be one.

14:09 - A L
  then the other one is, I need a secondary, I need another approver. And then that's the other text.

14:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then it goes to another approver.

14:17 - A L
  And then it goes to that email. They add this stuff, you know, email in. The email gets sent and then that person ideally gets taken to another page.  Being like, I guess it's okay or no, it's not okay. Kind of like that. I understand.

14:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a quick question. we do not track when they ask for editions. Editions?

14:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  What do you mean by editions? What do you mean? Or like, yeah, they want to.

14:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If I get a policy that I do not agree with, I just send you an email on MS Teams and say, hey, Ivan, I got this policy from you.  I think it's almost done, but I don't like the third chapter. Could you change the third chapter? This happens outside the platform.

15:00 - A L
  So I think like, you know, ideally it would be in the platform, but I think for the MPB and MVP version, it might be better, like, even like hydrolyzed, that's what like, she was saying that like, it could be offline too, as long as you kind of catch it and then we are able to resend it later on.  But of course, ideally you'd be able to have a chat function in your thing, but I think it's more like how long.  But I'm not describing a chat function.

15:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is I understand the chat function. Not even a comment, just like, because the point is, if I am in the process of approving policies, and I'm a bit paranoid of corporate lifestyle, I want people to know that I didn't approve a policy.  I want it to be tracked somewhere. You know, this is me, maybe this is not a common behavior.

15:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we will have approved by, I think that's what we will have.

15:51 - A L
  But if you say don't approve, then I think you're maybe, like, if they say no, I don't want to approve, you want to explain why.

16:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's part of when we get to approval. So if you don't ask me to approve it and I say no, then let's get That's a different page.  I would go to that page for sure.

16:11 - A L
  Absolutely. Sorry.

16:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're absolutely right.

16:14 - A L
  Yeah, this was this is the start of the flow when we are yeah Yeah, so the policy approval status, I guess it's next to the template email If that's where we would get one that would say like I approve or I don't approve and maybe why Or something and have a space for them to explain why they don't approve Something like this Yeah, I I can approve this.  I would say I yeah main is I can approve the policy I can I can approve this policy and then the other one is I want to I can approve this policy now Something like that and then the gray is I need a code approver or something  I need a code, I need a co-approver and I can approve the policy now. I can approve the policy, yeah, this policy now and then or the other one would be I need a co-approver.  But what you're saying is reversing the order, is that it? Yeah, yeah.

17:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because right now one of the patterns we've been using is the main option is always to the right side and is the strong color.  And the gray option is on the left side. I mean none of this is massive but just trying to keep up with the...  I don't have a strong opinion on that so...

17:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, yeah, because if you can that's always good.

17:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we bring those buttons here and if I click I want the second approver. Yeah. thing opens up there.

17:59 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. don't need I think we can skip this first one right if you do can you zoom in a bit I think it's because we now yeah you can skip you can skip this one right because how do they add the co-approver then they need to go to the add co-approver page right oh yeah so you skip that one and it goes to the one to the right of it where are those two buttons that are on the first that makes up okay yeah share copy link okay perfect so let's say I'm putting this policy together I could approve it on my own but I don't want to there's another button here I want a co-approver I click this button and I'm  taken here and then I can just add some emails for other people and then I send it for cool approvers and then do we need uh just one thing do we need mark as required mark approver as required is this something we will need what do you mean mark approver as required you mentioned that sometimes approvers are required maybe i'm maybe they're always required you send them here they are required that right yeah they're required too like what I think we should just say like if they're sent out then they're required to all listed to approvers must approve yes so if I send it to 10 people I need 10 approvals is that correct yes I have a feeling we'll probably  need to change it in the future we can start with this and we probably need to enable users to be flexible there because they'll still, I want just one of my hire to prove it and I'll send to five of them but for now let's keep it simple but we probably need to add a track box on each number to say or something like that but this can be extended a lot so let's keep it simple.

20:22 - A L
  So your policy has been for approval I get to see this thing or I click go to my policies or I can go to submit another policy what happens when you click submit another policy I would just close it like go to my like it's been sent to approvals and then go to my policies I wouldn't.  What were you thinking about studying here?

20:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where would it be?

20:45 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I just repeated the modal above but I think we can remove it like this just to go to the policies myself since you're submitting me to another okay

21:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  uh perfect so then policies opens then the page above right or no sorry right no no the one with the policy you don't have to search for it that one it goes to the one to the right the for that one okay yeah so my question is here uh we have a model and then that model gets replaced by another model uh which one so so basically the policy the whole policy page is a model right it's opened as a popover overhaul page it's a layout over layout right so you open policy and then when you open this model for co-approvals we just move the uh we just move the policy content and we replace it with smaller model right that one okay uh yeah that might be a bit uh complication for us but i think we can manage it yeah that's  time, guess. But it is a bit weird, you know. Maybe I'm wrong here. This is my objective opinion. I usually don't see models replacing models.

22:12 - A L
  Maybe my models, don't understand.

22:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  The model is the thing that pops up in the middle of your screen. So model is, for example, model is something, so you have a page, normal page, and it pops over it that you usually call model or whatever the name is.

22:27 - A L
  So when I say model, I'm meaning this.

22:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  So you have this model, you have call prover, and then you have policy. Policy is also model Y. Is it model?  Because it opens, and you can call it X, and you do not do any page navigation. It just opens over your existing page.  So I'm thinking, but I don't see any easy solution here. So let's try to roll with this and see how it works.  Because when you click X, we don't actually close the model. You just show another model. So it's not like usual model behavior, right?  I know why this is like this because of everything, but just a comment maybe to hear your opinion on this one.

23:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do agree that, especially for maintenance of the platform as this moves forward, it's going to get a little bit confusing and more error-prone to have so many models.  So maybe we can brainstorm not now some ideas on how to put the models in some other way that is not so confusing.  But I think that's a solvable problem, I think, but for now I would keep it, but I also understand what Ivan is saying and ideally we will move away from it at some point.

23:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, because usually when you click X what happens is you can see the page below it. So page below this one is policy page, can see it's a grayed out, blueed out, and then you would expect that once you click X that you will go to the policies page.  Actually here, if you click X, correct me if I'm wrong, you should go to policy page, one single policy page to the right side of the screen.  So that's something that's a bit unusual, but let's try to do it.

24:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Very good point. So let's say I click on go to my policies, I go to that other place, and now this flow on the perspective of the compliance officer is finished.  Let's look at the perspective of the person that receives the email, right? Yes. So you get this email question, is this the visual of the emails?

24:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't know. Did you come up with this? Currently we need to, I think it's every and more now actually did a new design for it, but.

24:47 - A L
  Well, I think we can try to send this to, like it seems like our current email doesn't have that ability to design that more than simple of the one that I forwarded you or took a screenshot, but it would be nice to be able to.  to this level.

25:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  but yeah, okay, we can have content as everything is fine here, just a matter of design and everything, how it looks like on the white background, I guess, or do we want to have a good background on the whole.

25:14 - A L
  I think it's with the blue background, yeah, we can check with Borno what can be done, because I think from my understanding it's limited at the space, let's go.

25:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  Males are tricky, because you cannot do design as usual, and you have to support all different clients, and if the design is complex, then it breaks on Outlook, Outlook Desktop, Outlook Web, Gmail, blah, blah.  It's actually really weird, but it's not as easy to do, so the simpler the better, but yeah.

25:40 - A L
  This is pretty simple too, so we can see, but yeah, let's go like they go and click on it, and then the next one goes back.  is good, this is simple design, but yeah, let's move forward, you click the button, and then you go to the one to your left.  Yes, question.

25:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  Users who click the button will always be users of the system, so they will always have account in Yeah, well, yeah, this is what we were talking about, like, kind of the single sign on and versus, like, you know, so they can automatically get in, they get a magic link, and then they need to sign in to log in, I would say that should be requirement, because they are employees of the company, they need to have policies, they're not only the approvers of the policies, but they also need to go to the training.  So, because even compliance, people need to go to training, I guess, right?

26:23 - A L
  Yeah. Yeah.

26:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. So then we can safely say that they will have accounted the system. The question is, will co-approvers always be admins in the system?  So currently we have employee and admin.

26:35 - A L
  No, they won't.

26:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. Good. In that case, this view. Because you could also eventually end up in their employee portal, you know, like, and they can be like.

26:46 - A L
  Yeah, it needs to be part of employee portal, or it can be a separate thing from all of them.

26:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, no, I think it should be an employee portal.

26:55 - A L
  So I line there. But in here, I guess it's like then they have two buttons on the bottom, I guess.  And it's like, this is ready for approval. And then, yeah, I don't approve this policy. And then does a pop-up happen after I don't approve the policy being wise, then they can put in something?  Or is it like a button on the top? Or maybe the approve button can be like, if you move it to the right side in that column on the right, maybe they can add a comment button in the column.  With the reason and then you click complete.

27:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  Because I think users are used to having these things at the bottom, so I wouldn't move it. would try to have consistent actions here.

27:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  but OK, I'm now getting into designs.

27:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Jara and Romero can say.

27:43 - A L
  Like you see the review process on pop. You already kind of have a box on there called underneath the, like the third box on the bottom box on the right.  You know what I mean?

27:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, that's like, what is that?

27:57 - A L
  And is that where we would put it? This is not a comment.

28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just a log, so it's not the right section. It's a read section. So I do agree that if we can get users accustomed to always knowing where is the button that they need to press, I think this will make things really easy for them.  And also, I understood that our current decision if I do not approve this policy, for this version, there will be no comments, no reason, just I don't approve this policy, right, for this version?  Yeah, I guess so.

28:41 - A L
  But I guess what they do, I say I don't know, then there should be a pop-up that says, we have sent a message to them to say no.  Or like, there should be one step to confirm, like, OK, yes, it's being deployed or no. We have sent a message to the admin or something like that.  You know? Yeah.

28:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So. Just to make Ivan happy, let's put another pop-up. No, I'm just kidding. The extra pop-up is something that we really need here, I guess, because it's a card order.

29:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's not a card order, it's a pop-up.

29:12 - Romeu Rodrigues
  With the previous pop-ups, we're working on this one, closing one, closing one, and opening the other one. Would it an overlay of pop-ups, like pop-ups?

29:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, and this is point that Ivan mentioned. We intermute pop-ups. It's not so good to have so many pop-ups.  I would say the problem here is layer over layer.

29:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't think it's a problem as a pop-up. It's just that we already are in a model, or a drawer, or whatever, and then we are showing things not over it, but instead of it.  But yeah, that's the problem that we need to solve some other time. Future event problem.

29:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, exactly.

29:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  My question to you is when I click X, Where do I input the text that's a description of why I approve it or why I don't approve it?  Do we have that or do we need that?

30:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  understanding was that, okay, on this version you're seeing? I don't think there's that text, no, there's no text for that.  My understanding was that for this v1 we were just selecting a yes no thing, no description.

30:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then in the review box right above this, then we don't need to have texts, right? So we can remove this, we have our own blah blah blah, this whatever.  And then later, once we have this, we can extend it with...

30:48 - A L
  Yeah, I guess so. Because one of it is like, one is I can approve it, I need to send it somebody.  And then here, when you send it back to them, I send it to, I'm working on it, I send it to Yvonne to review.  Yvonne, does he still have the edit button on the top right? Can he edit it and say, I approve this version?  Or does he not able to touch? He just reads the version that's there. And then he gives a comment, like it's locked, you know what I mean?  Cause right now we have the edit button on the top right. Yep. I don't know, that's also a question actually for you.

31:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Do you think cooperatives need to be able to edit the policies or not? depending on their role? if they aren't pleased, they should edit it together, that's right?  Yeah, like I think if you're an approver, like, like... Yeah, right.

31:44 - A L
  Best practice like approver would like you can edit it and you can make comments on why you've made the changes because that makes the job of a compliance officer easier.  You know, it's like, okay, just make the changes you want. But if we're making this MVP version, maybe we should just lock everything, you know, and then you make it offline.  And then they send it out. and for this MVP version. Yeah, we can't do that as simple as possible.

32:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then we can see what exactly people need here, and we can extend it. But I wanted to also ask another question.  So OK, let's conclude then. Edit button won't be visible for co-approvers if they are not admins. Is that correct?

32:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, let me. So let's say we will keep different, we will track different versions, because that's complex, right? Different?

32:26 - A L
  No, Sal, if you see on the one that you're at right now on top has the edit button on top.  So that should be disabled, I guess, for approvers, like the approvers.

32:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  So we should even have that button.

32:38 - A L
  They should just see a locked policy and say, is it ready to go? So yes or no?

32:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can also remove share button and download button while you are there. Because we don't have that implemented yet, and we removed it from the app.  So you can remove it from design. now we can edit, of course, once we add the functionality. because okay perfect my point I agree my point is that if we start letting approvers edit it we will need to have different versions like oh this was this is what James said is what Bob said and then it gets complex really quickly also Joe sorry to add the top bar can also remove the V1 version because version moved to the right sidebar so you can also remove all that V1 and not approved last updated because that all of that was moved to the right so that can also be removed yeah well there so that we don't yeah so that it's as close to the real as possible great perfect thank you okay so once you get into this page in the role is important if you are admin you will your admin and co-approver because for example Abbey is an admin in the system and I'm also an admin in the system  Abby says, even please co-approve this. When I come to this page, I should be able to edit it, right, as a normal admin.  But if I'm an employee, then I won't be able to edit it. Is that OK, Abby? Does that sound OK to you?  Yeah, that's fine.

34:15 - A L
  OK. Then question.

34:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK. Then it's clear. One last question, regardless of what I have. If you're an employee, where does this open?  How does this page open? Over what does it open? Because this is currently a model. And that means it's clear.  It opens our policies page. But what happens for an employee? Where does it open? Because employees do not have to go into them.

34:39 - A L
  It would go into their employee portal, right? they would have access it.

34:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  because they also have a policies pop-up. So if I open here, I'll to the screen.

34:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll hijack your share for a second.

35:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, and then I log in. So if I go here, then this Employee Portal and Policies, it's a reset, hold on, I think Okay, now edit, right?

35:34 - A L
  Sorry?

35:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, this is the deploy part, not edit.

35:38 - A L
  So this is now Employee So do we show then that screen you just did?

35:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  If so, if I am co-approver, I don't think right. Then when I click view, it will show here with additional stuff, like you said, so it will show with with here with that it will have it won't have this policy will say I approve this policy, right?  Yeah, I think it's

36:00 - A L
  I approve.

36:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't think you need all of the other stuff to like the version control and all of this I think if you approve or you just you really mainly care about the text that's in there Okay, so in that case look like this and just say I approve this policy I don't approve this policy if you wanted to do it for that In that case a job in a police ball vector So, yeah, so then in that case Where can you go back to the screen I approve I reject Screen yeah that one then from what Abby said we don't need this right sidebar.  Yes, right Or do we need that we maybe it's useful for users to have some info about the policy Yeah, it doesn't really matter.

36:44 - A L
  I would say it's like a Like I think it's whatever if it's if it's further prover You're gonna like you're gonna have some kind of role in this, right?  So if you have it, that's great. If you don't have it, it's good So I think like technology wise if it's just as easy to have it show  Yes, more information is good if it's going to add more work to get it shown then don't do it The feeling and the sound Romeo I like after he deployed it I got an email and I just forwarded to see you can see what the email Says in that and that's kind of a deployment.  So whether or not able to make the design cooler Then we can ask, know, Borna I don't know what is allowed in that email tool and maybe we could show that design But that's that's what happened.

37:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just got this email and he deployed the tool Yeah I do I do suspect That the simpler we can make it visually and like the way it looks like now The better because a lot of people in corporate might have some sort of walkers for Before downloading images on email and stuff like that.  So the email needs to work even if it gets stripped down to only text Yeah, and And I just realized this as I got it even I just forwarded it but that's not the

38:00 - A L
  turn on this one. So it doesn't have the click on the right button to the thing. Yeah I think Borna has some needs to update some templates also.

38:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay I think we're aligned then on this one and what needs to be done right or are we not?

38:17 - A L
  Does Romeo know the update then?

38:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah so the things we've discussed was remove these two, remove the edits, the two buttons I approve I do not approve.

38:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean do this action needs confirmation or should it be like I click it it happens? What do you mean I click it?  When I click it does it happen immediately or do you have to confirm the action by clicking yes I confirm it?  Like it once I confirm it you're it's done like because it changes the status of the policy if it's a really dangerous action then we usually

39:02 - A L
  I think there should just be one more pop-up, though, after this one, like that says, great, you have confirmed, thank you for doing the task, or you have not confirmed, it will be sent back and re-sent to you for a final approver, you know, with changes.  There should be, like, one more pop-up in there, Shell, you know, just to confirm.

39:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I believe this was kind of your question, even? Yes.

39:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  And also, I have another one lined up, so what's, what's, what's, what's, no.

39:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know, it's not a confirmation pop-up, it's just, it's just, uh...

39:51 - A L
  Okay.

40:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's it. Ivan, if you use this idea and another question.

40:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  My question is what happens with the fall-fall when the co-approver accepts it, then it's all clear. It goes to the next stage which is approved and then it can be deployed.  But what happens when I reject it as a co-approver? What's the status of the policy and what does it happen in the UI?  How does it look from each perspective? happens if I click to the same link as an employee? If I click the same link in the email again, how does this show in my view?  How does this policy with approval status page show once the action is already taken? Do we say, oh, you already approved this or you already rejected this policy?  Or do we show this? What happens?

41:00 - A L
  It's because I think where the steps are is like the compliance officer reviews it, like in review and then send it to deploy, you know, and then it follows up.  in between review and deploy, it just stays in review until it's been like kind of approved. And once it's been approved, then it's for deploy or something like that.  Like it's still in that review is when it's still waiting for feedback.

41:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but one question makes sense because, for instance, let's say that I received the email yesterday, I clicked here, I approved the policy, right?  And I forgot about it. I don't remember doing it.

41:32 - A L
  And today I check it out.

41:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  there's this email. don't know if I did it. And I click here and I open this same page with the button still active.  Yeah, it was overwrite my previous approval. I would assume that we would just hide the buttons and inform like you have approved this policy on some some data.

41:52 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, yeah, it also depends in which status is the policy, you know, it's a bit tricky. So if it's not deployed, then yes, then I agree with you.  If it is deployed, then should the user just see the policy as is in this deployed state?

42:05 - A L
  Yeah, if it's been deployed, then I think it's unlocked and they can't do anything around it. You can acknowledge it as a user, right?

42:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Or not?

42:13 - A L
  Well, if it's already been deployed, then you can't acknowledge it.

42:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  too late, right?

42:16 - A L
  then it's not approved, acknowledge. So that's employee action. That's something all employees need to The employee cannot acknowledge it unless it's been approved.  Correct. But I think we're all saying the same thing.

42:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So imagine that I've received this email last week, not yesterday, last week, and I've approved it. And then other things happened.  And then I go back to it. And I click on it. I cannot prove it any longer because it was already approved.  But now the status has changed. The action that is available to me is not to prove it, but acknowledge.  Do I see, by clicking the same button as before, do I see a button saying acknowledge?

42:55 - A L
  To me, it sense.

43:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think left something there. I'm still here. Sorry, had to move because I have to drive my daughter.

43:07 - A L
  I think they shouldn't. Once it's approved, they can either just see the policy that shows that it's been deployed, or they just get a pop-up that said this has already been deployed.

43:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

43:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  So we can just show a pop-up that says this you already answered this policy, and that's it. We can do maybe something like that.  We'll figure it out.

43:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if it sense.

43:47 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Maybe in the middle the body to say that there's a time to answer it, I know, 48 hours. I don't if it's going don't know what it's inspire, you

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  sense I would say so but does it make sense to include in the email like a deadline for the approval?

44:07 - A L
  Yeah I think it's a deadline like knowing the compliance officer if they need a secondary approver they're like yeah I think a deadline.

44:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No but this is a different thing this is a different thing so one thing is the deadline that the compliance officer defines like I need this done by next Tuesday and the other thing is like the link expires for instance when we you request a new password for something usually that link lasts for only a little while right and it and this is pre-set for every every time so for this version it seems to make sense that we wouldn't make we would not allow the compliance officer to set up their own expiry date because it's another layer of complexity for this version but at least to inform the user like oh this link might not work after a while  that's useful stuff.

45:02 - A L
  Yeah, I think we could put it in the email maybe at this point, right? Like it's just like we could just take the email for that.

45:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  Where do we define that? That's my question. Okay, so I understand.

45:18 - A L
  Could be when you, when, when, how about when you, when you, when you send it to a approval or just a full front line or something, you know, like, kind of like how you have it for the deployment date?

45:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would say that for the version we would do away with it, but in the following versions, we start to add up more functions like different roles of approvers, expiry dates, stuff like that.

45:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  So maybe for now, just give it the way it is. Yeah, let's keep it simple. It's not that cruel.

45:52 - A L
  Yeah, okay.

45:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  So we, we fold that, that side of the story one, then the last item. This is the last one now is so when you when you get the rejection on Chrome approval where how does the first thing in this code flow go to the left how does it look like so for me as an admin who no no no one to the right sorry that one yeah so once I got the rejection how does this screen look like to me can I can I have the same actions as okay the logs changed as they will say someone rejected my policy but what what are my next actions is it the same as as at the beginning so I can still approve it myself or how does that work or do you need to send for a real approval or what's what's the what's the story there how does it need be extended for reapprover and they're gonna have to make some changes and then maybe through that process they'll be like I feel like some kind of offline thing I can approve it myself like I don't need to maybe that person wants to I'm just gonna move it myself but I think they need to be presented out for approval I think we just go back to you know go back to

47:00 - A L
  Let's start when they do it again. Well, they can just do it all over again, right?

47:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is that what you're saying? They can have the same actions again. And that's it. They can approve it before we send out for another round of approvals to the same people.  OK, then that's all clear to me. think that Jean-Paul designed why I think we have it, so we don't have to do anything there.

47:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so we'll just do these little comments on things and then let you know. Got it. Shall we move into the next one or just to?  This one is fine, fine or something. OK, but just to keep track of things, can we keep it in review just to make sure that we do all the comments and then get it done?  Yeah. OK. Do you have anything you'd like show that is more crucial than this one?

47:55 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, it's not It would only the person who's asking for it, but it's just the people who commented yesterday and now it would be up to

48:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this one is, so this one is probably done, the policies, let's go, share the sound of publications. So we now have policies and communication separate, which is a good thing.  Just need to keep track of changes made in one place that affect some other places. Buttons are at the top, right?  I think this one was down here, Romeo.

48:35 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I was thinking about this one here, because the cards also have to do with communication. Could it that guys down there, the H1, the type of communication, the type of at the stage, I was in this doubt, I this back adjustment, but we can reverse it.

48:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, basically the idea is because the cards are kind of.

49:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  summary of what's happening the filter could make sense to be above the cards to know that it affects the cards but no strong opinions on this if you guys just prefer it the way it is on the website on the coded thing which is around here it's a lower priority because you can believe it in design we can put it once we find time but if it's fine if it's not if there is no strong opinion from any side I won't touch it for now but if you need to change something we'll move it to the design so they could see I don't mind I'm fine yeah perfect perfect good stuff so this is considered to be done correct also one thing just to keep so that you're updated we updated in the live app the statuses to be the same colors as this was epic request so we updated the statuses not started all these status stuff to be the same colors  as, yeah, as the, yeah, open, open, you'll see.

50:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What did you send it? Got it? Sign in. No, it's the old one, I think you need the new one.

50:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

50:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Organization admin. Sign in. It should be organization admin, so that should be the possible.

50:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  What? Click on the I, click on the I. Yeah.

50:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a typical troubleshooting move from a dev that I've seen a lot of things. Perfect. I don't want the employee, want the...  You can, yeah, you can do that.

51:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, and then policies, and then you see, I've updated this, so if we could get the design handle of these ones, please, that would be good.  These are done by me quickly, and maybe they need to be updated a little bit, just to be in line with the design.  Something, I would say this is low priority, but just something that we can add to the list, just to have a consistent design.

51:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, just that.

51:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Those are status labels or whatever, yeah. Status.

51:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

52:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  And yeah, you were saying no for us is everything we had to show communication is fine. Thank you for extracting it extracting it out and yeah that's done by me looks good to me.

52:13 - A L
  So do we have things ready for like kind of like what what is the priority for the next day or two then on the list yeah we still have things in progress here okay and the other things at the top of the of the of the list I was trying to wait a meeting I had a meeting with a carbon capture today where I wanted to show the third party risk management process with her but I think it would right around the time that it was kind of deactivated off of my advice so I couldn't like click into the third party process to look at it like is it matching what's in the fake month so if like John I wanted to revisit the process we should just go to the fake month to  see how the process ended up, is that the best way to do that?

53:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can visit the live page, I'll send you the link because the thing we disabled only is linked to it, but you can still access it via the direct link.  So I'll send you that. But it should be similar to the risk. I'll send you the link since like in the design channel sending link to this.  If you click on it, it should assessment. So you can maybe open it.

53:32 - A L
  third party risk, if you can send both the risk assessment and the third party risk one. Yeah, exactly.

53:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then maybe even the controls just have all three.

53:41 - A L
  in case, John, I want to look at some to see what.

53:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  In future, can label it only in our production environment and on test, can leave everything enabled so that you can always play with it in the environment.  OK. Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:56 - A L
  OK. Oh, let me just find it.

54:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  So then I think we have enough into the meeting tomorrow then, and I have another request for the design teams of something also a bit lower on the priority list, but something we need because we are trying to set, trying to make our team in the code.  Basically we need a color scheme. So I guess you are choosing your colors from some kind of palette or something so I'd like to have it so that we can have it doesn't have to be like extensive or something I just want to have the color color scheme that you're using so that we can copy it into our app so that we can stop using direct hexadecimal values and start using variables from the team so let's say orange you five or primary color or whatever we want to call them I find it with anything just just want to have it sorted out that's it  priority as it's not anything important, but I would like to have it to help develop their experience and design experience.  Perfect.

55:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll need to go in a minute, but I think it's also a good opportunity to try to get something else.  I think there was a Slack channel called Communication or something, or did I see it? Content. yeah, and I think it could be really useful if we can Google Drive or SharePoint or something where all the policies, all the firms are.  I know they are in the email, but it's just easier to refer back to them when we're using the Figma, link back to them.  I agree.

55:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, know.

55:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think also Slack also has a documentation channel, I've been using it with some customers.

55:56 - A L
  But yeah, we can do that. I think we need to add it, and I can add them in just.  Yeah, you know, it's on the to-do list, so I can do that.

56:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, yeah, no, I agree.

56:11 - A L
  We can we can find a place I can try to find the place for that. All right. Thanks a lot then.  Okay.

56:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  you.
