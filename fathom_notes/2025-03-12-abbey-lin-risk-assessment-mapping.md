  Hello. Hello.

0:02 - A L
  How are you doing?

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. This video is good, right? I heard my own echo.

0:20 - A L
  Yeah, over to the list.

0:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love these index cards. That's what I did. Oh, it's cool, man.

0:28 - A L
  Yeah.

0:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They, they never need updates.

0:38 - A L
  Hello.

0:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Good evening.

0:42 - A L
  I always see, like, you want to have, like, a sunny light next to you during the day. So it's kind of weird to see, like, it's like, oh, does it get actually dark in Croatia?  Yeah, It does. It actually does. It's actually rainy. So it's better that it's dark, better that you don't see anything.

0:59 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's all right.

1:00 - A L
  was snowing the last few days in Norway again. It was like I kind of teased everyone that spring was he comes everyone is so happy and then the snow came for the last time people have been like I was like so annoyed I had to wear my winter boots again today I was like damn it.  It's never as it should be but fine. And it's like I think it's like they tease you because you know it it's like I know it's March so too soon but like and I know this every year I've been here for 15 years right like it always comes by like there's no shower and you always get your hopes every year like this will be the one year that it doesn't happen but it's not that way.

1:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okey dokey so even that it's quite late over there I'll try to make this quickly as we can so basically we need to make sure we understand the the flow for risk assessment right and  As far as I understand, shouldn't be anything coded because I don't think anything was designed. So we start from this question.  Yeah, for risk assessment.

2:09 - A L
  OK, cool. So assessment will depend on how we decide we want to do it on this tour because a risk assessment can be done in different ways.  Oh, no, we did actually create something for risk assessment through Ivan back in the day in that pink version that we had with Carlo.  there's a we do have a risk assessment version.

2:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can just show it to Joe, but I think it's best. I think a lot of lots of things change.  So maybe it's just let's take it as an inspiration, maybe for Joe, but or we could just show it later and maybe later, maybe better later.

2:47 - A L
  We do have a risk assessment that was kind of drawn up into a stigma like almost a year ago.  Exactly, I would say. But but we never do like we end up rather than the music.

3:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  line and everything, but still maybe it will be useful to you later, but we can go over it. we can use it to check what we did and see if it's still kind of the same methodology.

3:11 - A L
  Got it.

3:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is what eggs did. Okay, so they did it. Did they do a risk management?

3:26 - A L
  I don't even remember. Yeah, we can go look at it and see. Okay, it's here.

3:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the good news is that it broadly fits with what we've been. Oh, this was jumbled. Let's keep it big.  Okay, so basically, do you see my screen? it? Yeah, I see it. Yeah. So we have the compliance officer senior manager.  And they are bringing people in as in suppliers, vendors, and so on. And from what I understand, they have a list of risk questions that they use to identify and define.  This is related to collecting baseline data. based on those answers, we get different kinds of next steps. And then there's the aspect of the double materiality assessment, which I'm familiar with the general idea, but I don't know the specific process and how it influences this.  Yeah, I can tell you. And then based on those answers as well, we get to make decisions regarding mitigation.  Yeah.

4:57 - A L
  Okay.

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me just open another one here. Oh yeah, okay. So this tab is about third party management. This is something that Abby and I designed.  I think for you if I'm just, this is not very helpful. So I'll just go through it very quickly.  And I'll explain why we're talking about third part management and risk assessment. Both of them have one thing in common, which is the first thing that you do when you get information helps to decide what are the next steps.  So for instance, in terms of the third party, depending on what kind of answers they give you when they send sending the questionnaire for the new supplier, for instance, depending on what they tell you, you would take different actions.  After that, you could send them a policy. could ask for more questions and that idea that the compliance officer receives some information and then based on that information they have a few possible paths is one that we seem to make sense here in terms of management and also I assume in risk management right?  Is this making sense? I don't see your faces so interrupt me if you need to. Okay on third-party management basically when it starts like the compliance officer does the risk assessment everything begins with the risk assessment to narrow down the scope of the suppliers and then the CO uploads a narrowed down list of suppliers that excel template and then they might approve the questionnaire which is the same mechanic as the policies before deploying we check if we agree on that.  Perhaps in the future we make like a recommendation for this sort of supplier with this sort of answers you should do this thing but the idea for now is that we don't put any kind of intelligence on that but that's a good place to put intelligence in the future.  So we give them some next steps and this is an example I'm using this as an illustration as an example of possible next steps when you bring in a new third card.  I'm sure it feels like risk management or risk assessment as some similarities to this. Is it making sense so far?  Yeah. Okay so let's go on to risk management mapping. One of the that we were at the start of this conversation maybe we said that there's many ways doing it and we start with the simplest way the way that we're starting the my report or something

9:00 - A L
  Yes, I think it's like it's like yeah, there's So there's like a way that you need to do it for ISO And like are you know if we're going okay?  There's like only e for ISO seems to be interested So I don't know and I have a meeting with Cognite We have a meeting with Cognite on Friday with a new sustainability person who is actually experienced in sustainability that they hired So that Uh The question is are like I don't know if Given you know trump and everything going on and all of this stuff.  I don't know if they're gonna still go for ISO um Because yeah, they like they're pushing back on a few things I don't know if they're gonna decide that they're gonna do it if they do it Then there's like a risk assessment for ISO, but not all of our our ones are doing for ISO So I maybe we just skip that ISO unless they come back and say they want to do it and then we do it one for them Otherwise, then you have like a general risk assessment, which would be B and then  You have the third one would be the double materiality. So B is like a regular risk assessment or a general risk assessment, and then the C is double materiality.  And in the past, and I think how we did it with the Carlo last year, we had planned for the double materiality because that was linked to CSRD.  But now that CSRD is now only for companies over 1,000 people, the question is, can we get away with a generic risk assessment?  Or are the smaller ones still going to want to do the double materiality? Because that's kind of like in their mind already.  I'm assuming that if something is not forced upon the small companies, they won't do it.

10:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's my feeling. Yeah, that's my guess.

10:51 - A L
  So my feeling maybe we could do it. But a double materiality isn't that different than a generic materiality because double, there's  right? So the second part of it, it's pretty much the first part is a generic one and the second part is a financial one.  So and then that comes to the double materiality, right? First on generic one and then on the materiality maybe just priority points.  Yeah, yeah. So I think maybe we can get away with generic possibly.

11:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean if you think of our pilots for example and then what would they require first most of them?

11:28 - A L
  I have to go back to like some of them because we haven't gone to back to some of the ones like I would have to ask Ardok because I think Ardok was interested in the double materiality.  But let's start with the generic one and if we need to add the second part of the risk assessment we can think about changing it.

11:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  so you said sorry just understand. So generic one, we have generic one and then the double materiality is just generic one plus financial.  Yeah. Okay, so yeah then we definitely, if we do generic we already half of double. Yeah, that makes sense.

12:03 - A L
  But like the like and there's like nobody's really like materiality is a relatively new concept. So I wouldn't say that there's any experts in double materiality.  So I think we can get away with like a version and then see what happens.

12:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  Got it.

12:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for the generic, I would do quickly.

12:27 - A L
  So this is what I'm even you say like an AI guy that that might work because I'm wondering like I sometimes think for the risk assessment AI is easier to use.  But like if we think about the easiest one, let's say we have digital companies, right? Like I think at one point we're going to have to find categories.  And I feel like it's almost easier to say, hey, you're a digital company, we identify these as your biggest like we do that identify identification of what your biggest risks are in ESG.  Do you agree? You know, And then they kind of like check off the ones that they agree with, and then we ask them to do additional research on it, like, okay, now I confirm using SASB talking to your employees.  Let me think about this. I could step back. It's like, you have to identify, like, how would I, how would I do it?  So, like, I paid, I paid like KPMG and my last company to do a risk assessment. So, what did they do?  They, they looked at my competitors and what they were doing. So add competitors, because somehow if they do some, that could be part of the checklist.  Are you writing it down? Go and see it. Competitor, oh yeah, competitors. Then they say, talk to your investors in terms of what they think their risks are.  Talk to a select group of employees to confirm what the risks are. Talk to the management and the board what they think the risks are.  And then the management board are usually the one that or the manager is usually the one. ends up prioritizing all of these to see which one is more important.

14:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is it something, is this process, is it like a strict set of questions or do you just talk to these groups and ask them about risk?

14:12 - A L
  It can't either one, but I think it's easier, like this one, when we send them a questionnaire, like what do you think the top risks are, right?

14:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  that's, sorry, that questionnaire is something that's usually similar for everyone or it's just whatever you think is good enough.

14:33 - A L
  I think you, like the best way would be like you think these are your risks, somehow import the risks into the questionnaires and then have the questionnaires rake, you know, from one to ten, what is the impact, whatever this risk or add new risk or something like that, I would do that.  And so then they, yeah, so and then after that, all of that research, they would kind of like put all the issues and then you have it on a board and then you kind of rank  and based on impact and likelihood or something like that. And then you select your top few risks that you want to manage through controls.  So I think the easiest one, and then you have to look at SASB, which is like an industry standard on risks, right?  So like SASB, SASB is like an industry. So you can see like they actually say by industry, by type, these are the common risks within the industry, right?  So ideally, we can probably just take SASB, have Brighton pull SASB. then we have a list of like, if they say they're in this industry, this is what SASB says your risks are, and then maybe start with that.  But I think we also want to lead them towards our controls that we've already identified, right? Especially with the digital companies.  Like we've identified in E that they're

16:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  We risk our scope one to like all of the controls, you know asset management all of those things that we say and we're connecting Those should ideally be Okay, can we just put back I understand this part about About how how who defines which are the usual risk for which industry for example, that's time where they say it's be But what about how does this process process usually look as you said you hire someone external or you do it yourself?  You go to this group of people the job wrote down Investors blah blah you asked about the risk. Is there anything else that you do as part of a risk assessment?

16:41 - A L
  Competitors like customers would be and and the suppliers like you look you talk to all your other stakeholders That you have so you have to like say like you you reached out to kind of your ecosystem You just go to all these groups ask them about risks and then you conclude something or is there  So if you did it in digital way, like you pay KPMG to be really inefficient and have a meeting with them and then write up a paper like, know, that's saying, like, these are the risks and different things, right?  If you want to do kind of fast and easy, like, you know, you do a questionnaire, right? But some of the summer, like, you know, an oral one, you might get more information out of than a questionnaire, right?  Because you're able to kind of probe different questions and why whatever. But I think for a generic, very quick version, Toyota version, then you can just do a questionnaire and send it to them and ask them to respond to it.  Okay.

17:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then you would, the list of the civil risks, we would also get from SASB.

17:40 - A L
  Yeah, or like, or we, we like, you know, for digital companies, I don't know what's there already, but we could just be like, you know, like, within, like, within digital companies, we think these are your biggest risks.  Like, these are the general biggest risks in E and then pull up our control, right? Yeah. We already created, like, and then let them like select or control.  firm or just put that into the questionnaire already so it's scope one two three whatever and then have people like rank it a confirm or say yes I agree this is a risk no I don't agree or like like you know one to ten material impact for that and then you kind of pull it up together.  This is something couple can do this process usually once a year. This is technically supposed to guide everything that you do right it's like based on the risk assessment we see scope one two and three are the highest so then you create a policy that says scope one two and three is the highest and this is why we're doing something and then you take the controls and say okay because we said these are the highest and like what we need to do we manage controls on it and then we do the reporting and management right so that's kind of how it is but we kind of reverse engineered it and being like we know that this is it and then we want you know we kind of want to find a way where we can get them to come up with these.  Those are not add too many more or they're going to have to create their own controls if they find So many more but most of them Like you know zanetta or like art off that don't know what they're doing They're not going to go out in their way to find out more controls, right?  But it might be the ochre horizons or ochre carving out to know what they're doing that are going to create more controls but most likely How do I say this the ochre carbon captures the ones who have sustainability and compliance officers Most likely they're not going to like maybe linda is in charge But usually it's a different function that does risk management.  So like most of the ones that do have a system are probably not going to use the system.

19:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's like They they already know what their risks are and they're going to and that's why they're managing it But for companies that don't have anything then they would use this as the management process so one one question then Are there any other competitors or not competitors, are there any digital Yeah, there's like like so many risk management tools that are like rose royce

20:00 - A L
  Oh, like, you know, which one or maybe the most. Oh, well, there's a whole company called enterprise risk management ERM or environmental risk management.  There's different types of risk management, but I don't know what is one famous tool. There are just so many risk management.  So this is the thing is like, we also focus on ESG risk, right? Because enterprise risk is like, like security and privacy, it's competition risk, it's operational risk, it's health and safety risk.  Like, well, you know, we're trying to focus on like the risk within ESG there. Okay, that's also why for larger companies, they're going to be like, wait, no, I don't want to do this because I have an overall enterprise risk management.  So I don't want to only do ESG. I want to do, you know, all of, I want to do all of them.  This doesn't, this tool doesn't make sense because this only focus on ESG. And what about this?

20:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  This just to step into the process. You said you need to ask different groups of stakeholders or. whatever in the app, is the form exactly the same for everyone or does it differ based on the group you're asking?

21:10 - A L
  I think you can make it the same just to make it easy, except for competitors, you actually don't take competitors, you wouldn't send them a question.

21:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's something you fill in.

21:25 - A L
  It's almost like you would do kind of how we did it in some other ones. Do additional research on the website, look at SASB, look at UN Global Compact, look at your competitors' websites, and then collect any information, and maybe write some notes or something, or add them to the risk list that we're going to add to our questionnaire.  So it's also like you don't just take ours, our suggestions for granted, but that they've also done some research themselves.  Okay, and then let's imagine...

22:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  we managed to create a form that Universal that then sent out to or sent out or filled in by all these groups of people.  Doesn't matter. They answered some kind of risks from one to five or whatever. Then we found the score and then we get a list of top five risks or something like that.  Right. And then we connect those top five risks to controls in our system. And then we say because you have these top five risk, if you agree with them, then you need to fill in or complete these controls.  That's kind of, think I think for our MVPs and testing it out.

22:35 - A L
  Like, yeah, ideally it's all linked and then your policies and procedures and trainings will be linked to these controls and everything.  But I think in our MVP version, just launching it, we can be like, okay, you launch whatever. You might be able to get away with not linking the controls directly.  might say, okay, you've done it. And okay, now I can tell you yes, this matches and it's okay.

22:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know.

23:00 - A L
  But yes, ideally it would be like, okay, these risks are linked to this control, so if you select these, so eventually if you want to get like a library of different types of risks linked to different controls that pull up, right?  Like with different sectors and everything that can be like really interesting on a like a future level when we have that ability, right?  But right now I think it's too much.

23:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, so, so, okay, I think I understand the process right now. Do you have any questions?

23:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, keep going. Yeah.

23:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  So, so, okay, then now I understand the process. My next question would be how to map this to the actual app, the website or actually fortify app.  So, you said that this is something we would ideally want everyone to fill in when they join the platform.  no, no, no, this this is only done by like 10 people max.

24:00 - A L
  So this is done by the admin and then the admin by by by doing we want them to do it as soon as possible for that company, right?  No, I think it's only we do it when they want to do it like I think like how do I say this like like I've done my whole job up until my last job not doing a risk assessment like a sustainability and compliance officer could not because they just jump right into their job right policy procedure training like I risk like you know you don't do like in a formal process where I interview people and do that but if you wanted to do it from like a to z and some companies who don't have any prior experience can't jump into anything yes then they might want to start here once just kind of set like okay this is why we're doing the controls this is why we've we've done that yeah okay makes sense yeah then it will just be like okay in that compliance map journey it is a first step but it's let's say optional

25:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  wants to do it, right? Yeah. Okay.

25:03 - A L
  Then it was optional now that CSRD, like so if a company is under CSRD, it would, it's, that's the only mandatory thing actually that you need to do in CSRD.  So that's why it's kind of like change. There's so much like worry about double materiality. That was the one thing every company had to do.  Now it's taken out. But if we have companies over 1000 people, I don't know, like Cognite is also over 1000 people, then like, then they might have to do it that way.  Okay.

25:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. Cool. Yeah.

25:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So based on this, what I'm thinking is the risk assessment is comprised of forms, right? Research and forms, I think.

25:51 - A L
  Yes. Like fill in blanks and forms.

25:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

25:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But for instance, like the research that we do internally, like competitors, we could input that research into like an internal form.

26:07 - A L
  Yeah, like actually, because if you think about ISO, the way ISO does it is like they have a legal register, which actually I should have added that.  Like if you go like do research on your competitor, are there any legal like things that you should like additional legal things that you want to consider?  Like these are like questions that you should ask them before so that they feel like they've done like all the research that they needed like so.  But for ISO, you need to have a legal register for, know, and then you have like this aspect and impact register that you need to put in information in.  And then you have like this stakeholder register for ISO. So this is kind of putting the same thing, but putting it in a different like more of a workflow rather than the ISO is like here's the documentation for this.

26:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. So what I'm thinking is in terms of the platform is that We probably have the sort of components we need to use, right?  need... it's the same thing we've been building. Yeah, collect information. We need to track completion. What we don't, and maybe assign controls.  What we don't have is... Sorry, I'm sorry. What we don't have is view results.

27:50 - A L
  Yeah, we don't have the view results and the matrix type map.

27:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's what I mean with the... Yeah, really right.

27:59 - A L
  So... Okay, we could, so this is the compliance officer.

28:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They sent out forms for different actors in the system, right? And they also fill in their own form.

28:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean, is there an order to this or it just needs to be done in whatever way?

28:33 - A L
  Ideally, the people will be ranking, I think, like you can go do both ways, but I think the simplest way could you can go like, hey, let me send this one to Xiao and Yvonne and you guys just write in what you think your risks are, right?  And then you have a lot of different risks and then you have to kind of prioritize the risk. But I think it might be easier just to be like, hey, Xiao and Yvonne, you guys either one of you agree with the risk, you know, and then they go, yes, no, or like probably people might say that's not good.  of a risk assessment you that is being a, hey, Jaune, Yvonne, can you rank this based on impact at what you think the impact is and what you think the, what is it called?  likelihood, right? Like, can you rate the likelihood an impact? And then you start to get like a score, right?  Like, you know, maybe somebody in the community will think this top is like, you know, more important, like it's more important for you to do digital stuff than governance.  And then maybe a board member will be like, governance is more important, you know that. And then you start to be able to see like, where, what are other people saying is the biggest issue?  then you kind of take those and say, you know.

29:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but for example, do you start with, I don't know, take a management or it's not important, you start to manage very competitive research or?

29:40 - A L
  No, you should ideally start with like the research because then by the time you go to the questionnaire, it's like the final thing that you're getting confirmation because through your research you might realize like, hey, like, you know, these are all the, like, or it's like, here, these are your, your risks that we think that you might have.  I think we kind of built this into, do we do? We did build a risk assessment module, Yvonne. We did build a risk assessment module.  No, we didn't.

30:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't remember. It's the first one in the compliance. No, we built the third part.

30:14 - A L
  Because they had all of those different issues and then we were like, you need to put eyes on them.  Remember, like, my dad actually looked through it and was like, I don't understand.

30:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Let's remind myself. I'll take a look and speak my own language immediately. Yeah, there is because... Yeah, I think we did do one.  Good. Maybe you're right, actually. I completely forgot this. Yeah, I'm pretty sure...

30:43 - A L
  Oh, I forgot too. I completely forgot about this stuff.

30:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, oh my god. Yeah. actually like that we did this to be honest. now I think I understand. process.  And now we can try to map it with design. So yeah, when whenever you're ready, we can jump into the Figma and see what's what's done.

31:08 - A L
  Yeah, okay, we're consistent because maybe like, like if my idea is still the same. Yeah, yeah, let's see.

31:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  So yeah, let's go to the Figma for sure. Yeah, then if you want, but it's actually in the app too, but maybe it's like in for now, it will be quicker because an app might work so we can we can first check Figma then.  Okay.

31:30 - A L
  And I remember in the app, we stopped at some point if I remember correctly. we didn't build the whole thing for the app.  But that's also good.

31:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's good.

31:38 - A L
  That will make it go faster that we do have a risk assessment process.

31:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  So it should be iteration one, or I can share if you want, but however you prefer, it's iteration one page in Figma in our Figma.  And it's at the bottom completely bottom last row. Yeah. There you go.

31:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can share if you want to.

31:59 - Ivan Ćelić
  Just go there.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'll click on your face. Yeah, I think I'm already there.

32:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK.

32:06 - A L
  Well, that won't make development a little faster.

32:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. I said I completely forgot about this part. know, yeah.

32:14 - A L
  Me too. I was like, oh, let's go through, let's see. Yeah, OK.

32:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, so yeah, this is the 2.3 to zoom in to the screens, yeah, one by one. But basically, this is it, yeah.  So here. So it's kind of like Step 1, familiarize with your typical risk.

32:32 - A L
  So you would click on it, and then you go to the one to the right, which kind of lists out typical risks that are there.  But I feel like we might be able to make it easier than this, right? And then if you go back, and then it goes, and then I think it's the next one, is I collect the baseline data.  So then you would enter that and go to the right a little bit more, even more right here. So this is like checklist, collecting the baseline data.  you know, have you looked at SASB? Have you, and I can't zoom in, I can't see it, but yeah, have you looked at internal resources like company policy?  That's true. Have you done research on competitors? Have you done research on the company, these are actually good questions, and then on the sector you're operating and then, and go, yes, no, yes, I want to add evidence to be able to show that you've done it.  Yeah, this is all good practice. And then, and then you go to the questionnaire, and then the questionnaire, yeah, you could add some notes and everything.  And then you go to the questionnaire, which is there. This thing? Yeah, this, no, this is like, this is the next part, that's the same one as the other one, just extended and showing how you upload evidence.  So that's just like an extension of that one right there. And then, and then go to the right.

33:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe this one will be easier actually through the app. So I sent you the link, so maybe you can go help if I could.  Yeah, so this is actually good. Yeah, so we'll now click on the link again, we don't have the redirect implementable.  so if we went wrong, it says, yeah, we need to check this out, what's going on, but basically, yeah, feel free to click.  So this is that first part, and then you click start to restore management.

34:31 - A L
  So you can see on top, yeah, like baseline data, and then now you have this.

34:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  Something is going out.

34:41 - A L
  And then this is not ideal. We should probably put the rest. then I remember my dad looked at this.  He was like, I don't know what any of this means, because there's no I. And then we kind of have to explain more about what it is.  But I do think we could delete some of these because we don't need so many risks. It's just like the typical risk for your sector.  know, we could completely slow by. as per usual we cannot camera on the back end but that's fine as I said we didn't test this after the initial before so yeah let's go back to the big one okay but we we did like the so that's how it looks so look a little bit bigger on top yeah yeah so then you go to the right and then you have a questionnaire and then this oh I think the next few are just like how this would look expanded or how you would look if you update it once the right so but these are standard checklist questions that you should do to try to find out risks ideally maybe on the left if you were to do is like these are the typical risks it'd be like you know relevant risk for your industry and then you'd put the saskey ones there you know on the left so they could see and then they could see if there's anything else you have on it and then you go to and I think yeah and then at the bottom you there was an add risk button you see at the bottom where they can add a risk based on what they see and that should also automatically  populate into the, if you, yeah. You won't, it's not important, but basically that's a new risk to the list.  Yeah, then that's a new risk that is added to the questionnaire that is, that's asked questions.

36:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, okay, so, sorry.

36:47 - A L
  They already have the address button though.

36:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the flow? Yeah, we have it.

36:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we have it.

36:54 - A L
  It's time, think. Yeah, yeah.

36:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  At least it's been programmed into the tool.

36:59 - A L
  Yeah, it's programmed into. It's not in the design here, so you can see that button that says address.

37:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's what I was trying to show you on the bottom.

37:06 - A L
  It's really hard to see it says address at the bottom. Yeah, so that and then you add rest, you go to the right or like, yeah, you go to the questionnaire, um, this one, that's not the question.

37:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  This is still a checklist.

37:19 - A L
  They're just showing how you would expand the checklist. Can you go to the questionnaire? Yeah, let's go to right.

37:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'll leave you. So basically, when you click on this button here, you add more risks here. You write some text and I think you even can up all some evidence blah, blah.  Then you go going to the right. you're going to the right.

37:39 - A L
  This is still the checklist. going to the right. They just like showing pictures of the checklist. don't know why he's spending so much time on that, but then you come.  Yeah, collect, yeah, collect stakeholder data here. So this is where that this is the checklist. And then you check with ESG, I think we might need to change it a little bit.  But these are the questions like for G, you know, what do you think the bribery risk factor is?

38:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  You know impact on organization impact on society and then low medium high depending on one to five Which I think we have to say one is one is high and one is low, you know And then people answer that when you combine you can select these are actual check boxes We have this is we all implemented already all of this So basically you are building your own final form think of it that like that So you click s then you get s questions in here And if you don't click g you won't get g questions in here plus at the bottom you always get the You can have you there's an additional risk one additional risk two that you add Yeah, and then they can add the questions Input that I think something like that.  So whatever you input it in the step bill before it comes here at the bottom always That's how Yeah, and then and then to the right I think we didn't Yeah, we stopped here  And then sorry, yeah, so here then you deploy to company the usual deploy flow. That's fine. Then we stopped.  This is how then the UI changed. And then we don't have this. This risk profile. We don't have yet.  This something we'll need to add and then risk profile. And then the last thing is control list, which is list of controls that you need to complete.  Yeah, well, like we don't, I don't, yeah, I don't know if we even need, like maybe we don't need this page in the MVP.

39:30 - A L
  Now we've identified their controls and they're in there or something like that. For now, we can skip this probably.  And that's it. Yeah, more or less.

39:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's the whole flow. So maybe we have a lot of it already except for this.

39:45 - A L
  I mean, maybe like the update of the design in, in the thing, you you guys did it really fast or you couldn't get the heading right.

39:52 - Ivan Ćelić
  like, like, it looks cool in that right now because of it's also the colors and everything. So we need to just maybe fit it in better.  The components are there. I think there should be much work there, much less than I expected now in issues.  And we also need to talk about how it actually works, but we can come to this part later. So yeah, now back to you if you have any questions.  This flow is clear to me at least. Abby, let me know if this satisfies everything you wanted regarding risk assessment.  And if that's yes, then I'm all good here. So if you have questions. I don't know if you think like we had done it before we realized that there was one.

40:36 - A L
  Now that you see this one, is it pretty similar to the other one that we showed you?

40:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would say one thing that I'm maybe not understanding here is there we said it will include you have to question management, you have to question the investor and all of that.  And how do you do that by deploying? that it? Yeah, it would be to deploy it. Every uh-huh. I now understand.  Okay good. I also like have a group called risk management, right?

41:04 - A L
  And you just deploy to the risk management group, right?

41:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  people that we can create the group And then my question would be where is the research part in this here?  it just somewhere offline or No, the research part is in that that initial checklist, right?

41:16 - A L
  that Go to the right that part, right? So we could you know, have you looked at these things? Yes or no?  Have you looked at your internal company policies?

41:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  I've done the research. Okay, okay. So now everything okay everything is in here. Okay makes sense to me.

41:35 - A L
  I think the only thing is like that maybe the front page we would need to move change like the risks like uh No, the next one to the right.  Well, think to redesign the front page. I agree But this like this is not ideal. I think it's overwhelming and We should only put the ones that we think you know based on you could be like, you know based off of your Company profile, we think these are your risks, you know and and then like explain what they are And then it moves to the next page.  So it could be a lot it would be a lot less right? If you think about our S risk, yeah, and then on the left reference risk, it would be a lot less there.

42:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  Change based on your industry or more or less, it's always the same.

42:09 - A L
  This checklist this checklist will be the same, but the ones on the left would probably change.

42:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  That makes sense. Because you haven't seen any of this.

42:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So first thing, I feel that this bit, we have an opportunity here to do something that's really cool, which would be a transition between these are all the risks, but we have selected the ones that matter for you, right?  Because if we show people a list of only three risks, they have no idea that we left out 85 risks.  But to show them the full list, and these links here are grayed out, they understand, oh, there was so much more, but 45 health.  me to focus on what matters the most. I'm not saying it looks exactly like this. I agree that's a bit of an overwhelming kind of thing, but the feeling that there's a lot and we just made it easier for you, I think it's really nice.

43:14 - A L
  Yeah, my only my only slight concern is if get an eager person to be like, oh, I hadn't thought about the risk limit.  I still want to do this risk even though it's not that and then we don't have it set for that.  But I think they could activate it. Actually, if we had like it would be ideally we have to take the risk universe and then have matching controls over that.  But then we started getting rules voiced territory.

43:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  yeah, and I see what you're saying, Joe, and we can think about what else we can put some we could put some really like side ones that we know that they're not going to pick so that they so depending on this risk that will be shown here different industry different risks of course does that change anything in the flow that comes afterwards on the question side other than the sidebar that you mentioned right now.

43:56 - A L
  No, because we're asking really like, know, just what is the likelihood? What is the impact? And that could be for any kind of risk.

44:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  Do questions change then or?

44:05 - A L
  No, I don't think so.

44:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK, OK, good. But just then the list of risks change because at the right.

44:10 - A L
  Yeah.

44:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  So maybe you just focus on me so I don't be sure of my screen now. Just focus on my things.  OK, you said this will change, this left part.

44:21 - A L
  ones on the right won't change.

44:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  They're the same. But what about the questions?

44:30 - A L
  Yeah, like those should technically link. Well. Will they always be the same?

44:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's my question. ask questions always be the same irregardless of industry?

44:42 - A L
  That, well, if we're not allowing them to select it, then yes, because it's the same one as the one on the top.  If we start allowing them to select which ones, then that it gets complicated, right? But if we're in the front and saying, like, we think these are your risks and then don't let them.  say no I don't think it's my risk then you don't have to take it out you know what I mean but I think eventually it should ideally be linked to kind of the thing so when they collect it then this one shows up but they don't that's being that but that might be then I worry a little bit that we're going to turn into this enterprise risk management tool which is already like rules race of like you know every possible risk factor every possible it starts to get a little bit more AI could have helped it you know okay that's it I got my answer then for now let's everything is the same just this initial part will change depending on your and I do think the front page can change too like if you go to the left now that we have a new design I think this kind of looks like a compliance map design but I think Romeo has created a new design you know so he can probably update this to make it look better but I don't know what are you yeah but yeah what do you think like a in general like yeah sure I think this should change otherwise people will confuse it further for the compliance

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  map. I don't know yet how it would look. I think it's a different kind of flow kind of thing archetype because like the the risk the third party is it works in the same way like you have this big deal of work at the start and then you just keep managing it right and this is kind of the same thing.  So you do it and then just keep managing it. So I think it's kind of the same way of thinking and this page should change.  Yeah this could be made less intimidating for sure. I would remove this from the site because it distracts about the purpose of this thing.  We can have a link to show.

46:54 - A L
  I think the reason why we did that is like people will forget what the risks are so that it's like at a risk.  And then you've already, you know what I mean? Like, it's like, we think these are your top 10 risks.  And then, so you're always aware of that when you're filling out the questionnaire. So when you have to add a risk, you don't end up adding the same risk that was already designated to you.  I think that was only the thinking there, but I think it could be designed in a different way, agree, or if they like, or like, no.  Yeah, but then you add all the risks and then they click based off of this, you know, select the risk that you want and then they can add a new one and then they have it.  Okay, so when I add the new risk, can I add anything?

47:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or I add a risk from the list?

47:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, it's a- You add anything.

47:39 - A L
  So it's kind of like, we've already pre-populated this list for you, these eight, because that fits with our questionnaire.  we don't want to take responsibility for those, are you identifying the risk? So you need to do all these additional checks and add any additional risks out of these eight that you might want to consider.  That's kind of it. Okay, wait.

47:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when I click, click, add the Is, can I write anything on the list, on the list title?

48:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  now, you can, yes.

48:04 - A L
  OK.

48:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I'm thinking is, if we keep this, right, I think we could keep it with the toggles. Yeah.  And then we have, in the same place, we see all the risks. And we also understand if they are being applied to our form.  And we also, the button should be on that side. So this section is the menu. And this section is where you do things.

48:30 - A L
  Yeah, or you do the checklists first, and then you toggle to the risks and say, like, these are your risks?  Are there any additional ones you want or something like that? Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

48:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also, that gives us an opportunity to put a screen in the middle with a little animation that lasts for two seconds and saying, oh, we are magically converting.  It doesn't need to, right? just creates the feeling of something is happening in the background. So if we separate these into screens, I think that would work to make this thing easier to use.  So if I click Evidence, I feel that these things could be expandable boxes. Yeah, they are. If you go to the right, it shows how they're designed.

49:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  Not that one.

49:21 - A L
  Go to the right.

49:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

49:22 - A L
  Then it expands to the boxes. And then you go to them, and then they have uploaded the file and add note, and then they have it to the right even more.  But I don't know if that's how you did it, Eva. I think we did something similar.

49:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's just our usual form design, but this is the functionality. I don't think we this one too much. It's just the background change that we didn't put in this model dark blue, but we can update that now.  It's fine. We got it.

49:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that there's also another thing that maybe we could do, especially on the home page, which is collect the baseline data.  review questionnaire I would separate and then I would have different tasks for send questionnaire for investors, send questionnaire for management, send question because then we have a sense of progression.  Yeah I like that. So what Yeah I agree.

50:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  I do like the flow. I do like that it's step by step guiding you. You know there are five steps to do the risk assessment that it's clear so I like that process.  But I agree with you Zhao. I think it would be more clear in line with now that I learned about risk assessment process at least on the general level.  It makes sense what you said that to have like send it to this group, send it to this group, send it like checking everything.  We had that in our original design. don't know Ivan if you felt if you don't wear that that original pink one is.

50:59 - A L
  I wonder I have it, because we had a design on that.

51:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would probably have it somewhere, but I don't know if I'll be able to find it.

51:12 - A L
  But it was a kind of a... The summer down at the bottom of...

51:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think I might have something. I'm trying to think...

51:26 - A L
  Yeah, I think...

51:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is it here?

51:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What I'm sharing?

51:33 - A L
  Pause. No, go up. No. It's even before this. It's like the version before. NPA, yeah, that's something.

51:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, that's...

51:41 - A L
  Let me think. I think it looks like production. me see if I can... See if I can find it.

51:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think I found it. Fortified car roll governance. It's one of the fingerprint files here at Poland. I'll share my screen in a second.  It's prototypes, but I want to read my report. Oh, yeah, I found it. I found it.

52:13 - A L
  You'll share it. I could share my screen then, guess. How do I share it? I wouldn't know this one.  Do you see my screen? Do you prototype. This one actually started like this. Intro, stakeholder wheel, issue survey, industry event parking, prioritizing, financial, and review.  This is actually a more detailed one around double materiality.

53:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  was more, yeah, double materiality wizard.

53:02 - A L
  So this is why it's more. So then it was kind of like, you kind of select the stakeholders, identify the stakeholders you want to send it to, I think.  then, yeah, and then you have, you have like the people you want to email and add the people, like group management that you want to send it to.  And then two, after you've identified them, might actually be easier. There's like, we tried to gamify to be more of a human.  I actually think you have the prototype, Yvonne, because I think the prototype actually makes more sense. Yeah, you know, yeah, I can, I can share it.  Yeah, you share the prototype, because you actually made it into interactive design. So you can, you can see it.

53:46 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'll show my screen, but let me just to so you can see Yeah, no, this is a whole lot, not this one.  I hope the social that when we build the end of that project, not the one for us. Is it in production file or I can have the prototype link here.

54:33 - A L
  I mean, I might have, I was trying to copy here. This is the figma I'm sticking in the chat, but I think I have a link to the prototype copy prototype link.

54:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  So do you know how do you start is a prototype a separate filing thing? No, no, you press share.

54:48 - A L
  I found it. You press share and then and then because I was trying to copy the link and then it says go to prototype and then you can see it.  I can start it. think yeah. it asks me for a password do you know the password oh this is yeah oh yeah maybe this is the devil material you was right here oh you did also okay um what I don't know what the password is do you know what the password I have no idea probably I really don't know we can see but this is it do you see my screen yes but it's zoomed in happy it's not it's not how do I assume it though do you want me to share yeah if you know okay I found this issue now let me see anyone with the password what is the password password I mean oh and said a password a year ago and let me save it without the password okay now it doesn't have a password but I can see your screen now and I think it took off the password okay but yeah  You see it? Because you haven't seen it. Yeah, yeah.

56:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, this is the double material.

56:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  This is the flow here. And then I guess Abir, we click continue. Again, there's a play button wasn't it?

56:13 - A L
  Or like we had a video that had it. maybe he knew. Try clicking group management.

56:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, usually in prototype when you double click screen it shows what's clickable, but I don't see it here. So something's share prototype.  Just use the slider at the bottom.

56:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which one? Yeah.

56:35 - A L
  Thank you. So group management, something would pop up and then you'd send it there. And then yeah, just keep pressing the slider.  then there's like, yeah. Yeah. This is stakeholder. So you put the stakeholders in that way.

56:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  then you have to go to the right.

56:49 - A L
  And then out of here like the E and S and G ones would pop up and you would select which ones you think are relevant.  Go to the right. And then from each of them. kind of like within this whole category like each one you would rate you know based on materiality or whatever on each of them and you'd go through it there's like a more much more detailed risk assessment as I can tell you but some people do this like each one like that and then yeah and then probably if you take a look this doesn't make sense that this person who's doing this fills it in why would they fill it in because usually they're like they like I think there's different ways of doing it it's like if there's only one person that's been assigned the risk assessment you can do it but ideally I think this should be sent to like you know you have a stakeholder wheel right so then yeah like after you do it you go to the right and then you go like like you know from the internal stakeholders they gave a score of this all the external stakeholders gave it this and then you kind of have and then you look at your competitions what they've done and then you look at you know and then you kind of move it into this this is way this is way too more complicated we like and then this is the financial materiality where you look at it you go what are the financial impacts and then you  I didn't mix it together. Yeah, OK. I feel like maybe it's too much. I think I agree.

58:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  I also cannot connect everything here. see that it's I like the actual full that we built a lot more because it's straightforward and it's more clear to me, at least maybe because we already dive into it.  Yeah.

58:19 - A L
  Yeah, sorry. No, it's a jump. I think it's to the first thing that we created over a year ago.  And then I think we over complicated it there.

58:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  But it did have that stakeholder invited.

58:30 - A L
  I guess is what we how we came to it is like you click your stakeholder and then you put the emails in and then like it kind of goes into the thing.  And then you had like this achievement unlocked, you know, kind of a gamified approach to, I don't know.

58:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, let's try to maybe conclude what's at least for in my head, but what's expected the job from design team is just to refresh the existing flow.  And one thing that we didn't define that we need to dive into, which we don't have to do right now is that map.  that graph that's the result of risk assessment. I don't understand how that works or how the numbers show, but we don't have to do that right now to be honest.  I think it usually looks like something like this.

59:14 - A L
  Are you sharing your screen? Yeah. Or you're not?

59:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'm not.

59:19 - A L
  No, we probably picked you out because... Oh wait, I thought, like yeah, I'm gonna make stop presenting.

59:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It probably looks a little bit like this, I suppose.

59:32 - A L
  Yes.

59:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I don't know if you have this component on charge ES?

59:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Nothing there. Okay. So we can build whatever needs to be built there, so we don't have that page yet.  Because this is a very common thing.

59:52 - A L
  I don't know, Yvonne, if you can find it. I'm sure these have been built 50 million times because it's such a common...  I don't know, we think it's available. right?

1:00:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it's a heat map. It's a heat map. Yeah, heat map is a better word. we can we should be able to do that.

1:00:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We can find a template to make it faster.

1:00:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I'll just when we come to this point, I'll just want to see a example of the data, how it might look so that I can map it.  other than that, it's fine. I think it's more important for Zhao now and Romeo to understand how this makes it look.

1:00:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where am I? am I? You're sharing Google right now. Yes, here. So I think the most of the things we're talking about are relatively cosmetic changes.  I think the one that is a little bit more involved is this one. Which one?

1:00:52 - A L
  Yeah, we're still showing risks. Okay.

1:00:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think the first two pages like this page and the one to right like you said with the rest I think those but mainly cosmetic only things maybe changing a little bit changing the logic is that sending to different groups of people but in background we'll just be just doing the deployment five times instead of once yeah yeah that's it but yeah let's say the same feature right yeah for sure and also if this is a question if thing that they do once a year and probably they realize they need to do it like two months before they need to do it and the process takes three months right it's it could by by by breaking it down we could use that as a way to prompt people to collect this information throughout the year and not just at the end right no this one has to be done in one go like and it didn't take that long but especially with the questionnaires like it's like you set out the questionnaires and you just start chasing them and then it comes and populates it

1:02:00 - A L
  So this should reduce the risk assessment very quickly, you know, at a time. So once a year and then maybe report it to the board, these are our biggest risks and stuff.

1:02:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe figure out some time later how we will version this by version. mean have a year by year progress or something.  But maybe we can, for example, once a year we just reset this whole page and have some tab at the top or something, the short history, blah blah blah, but we can think about that, think.  Yeah, I like that. We don't have to worry about that right now, to be honest.

1:02:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, so that is clear. me see what Romeo had told me about priorities.

1:02:46 - A L
  I think Romeo is working on dashboard now and then I think he'll work on third party next, right? Correct, yes.  And then this part, our integrity hub. Yeah, so.

1:03:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  about the data grid, how the data grid will look like on white background or something like that. if he can just, as I sent a message in the reminder just so you know, just to do it, it should be a quick, but we need to know how it will look like data grid for, I don't know, white background or something.

1:03:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just so you know, that's a small task.

1:03:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  What data grid, all the ones that we have for tables and users and so forth. Yeah, and we applied it everywhere, but on some backgrounds, it doesn't look as good as the one that we designed.  So we just need like how it looks on those ones. It's in the chat. I'll take you, just so you're...  Tag me, yeah.

1:03:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you. Got it. Yeah, so Romeo is working on dashboard. He should have something tomorrow. I don't know if at the time of the design sync, which is the morning here.  On Friday, third party management and Tuesday integrity hub stuff. So yeah. And then like...

1:04:00 - A L
  maybe next Friday like yeah this risk assessment one because it's just up there the other one and then I think yeah that would be really great if we have that because I'm thinking I'm realizing that Tegri Hub will be like especially now with CSRD the the whip being gone then Tegri Hub will be very much the carrot for people to want to buy our tool so it's good to get that one done but you need to have more content to be able to publish it so I think it's okay to wait for like this part of it yeah okay perfecto thank you for making the time at this time no I think I think we're good and then we have yeah and is there any other part of the product then I guess is the next part would be like kind of fixing after that I guess we can do it because we're next week would be fixing maybe the the entrance page for the policies procedures and but then we can fix that we can talk about that next week I think we have some time but that would be the next step probably yeah it's a big question if we I think you mentioned

1:05:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  this if want the FG filters like that or everything together or that page where you select. So yeah, that's a good point.  So we can have a discussion on that. I mean, this is not something that's crucial for the design now, but I would also like to.  So we discussed that PDF upload, you know, so how will that look like on the page? will just replace the policy content with the PDF and scrollable PDF, which is fine.  But maybe we I'll see if we need some design for that when we come to it. I don't think it will be much.  Maybe some minor button or two here or there, but other than that, I think it will be fine. Excellent.

1:05:39 - A L
  All right, great.

1:05:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Thank you.

1:05:41 - A L
  Thanks for coming, ladies and gentlemen.
