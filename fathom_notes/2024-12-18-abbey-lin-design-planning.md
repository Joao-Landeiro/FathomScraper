0:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Hello Based link here on the chat of the new board Hello everybody We are again Which one is it I see three documents Joe and the link that you sent Or I just have a front page maybe it's a Just when I went to the link it brought me here So maybe it's okay wait, maybe I need to maybe it wasn't opened yet apologies.  Let me open it again You click it okay thank you all right no no i think it was on my side okay yeah there yeah it's okay okay so i'll also share my screen so the record yeah that's it i i request an access because i don't have it so uh you can maybe can can you it's it's open it's just the first time i sent the link because so if you refresh the page it should open i see that ab is in and even is in okay cool um okay just just a quick introduction so for today we'll be focusing on the product roadmap and basically there's i always do this i get on the skulls like oh we're gonna do this i hope everybody's okay good night  Good morning. afternoon. I'm the same way.

2:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I didn't even notice. So anyway, thank you for being here.

2:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So basically there's a few different possible documents that help with managing a product like this. And you can read the screen faster than what I can.  I'll bring it to you. But basically today we'll be focusing on the product roadmap. Okay. And the reason why I'm showing you these different, these other possible documents is that we don't mix them up.  I don't try to do things that belong to another one. And we can really nail this product roadmap thing, at least this vision for now.  And yeah, basically what it does is it describes a plan to develop a product. It's not really about tasks is mostly about, you know, things we  focus on first and then later, depending on how the team is organized, this could be broken down into different tasks.  And I have these documents here. We don't necessarily need to do all of them in future sessions. I'm just, you know, comparing one to the others so it becomes clear.  And the great or the biggest objective for a roadmap is for alignment, right? So a roadmap is an alignment documents that we can refer to.  can update and you can also extract things from the roadmap to talk to different audiences. It could be internal audiences, could be investors.  Some companies like to show a little bit of the roadmap to their clients and, you know, alpha or pilot testers.  So this is it. And all teams should participate on this. Or if not the entire company, at least representatives of the business aspect, the technology aspect  line or either experience aspect. Okay. So this is an alignment session. This is not an idea generation generation session.  And this is really important because as we talk about this stuff, it's inevitable that we'll think of things that could be done.  And my suggestion for that is that we don't throw them away, we just, you know, type them down and drag them down here into this teal bar that is our parking lot.  So I know sometimes we get anxious when there's an idea, we cannot get to it immediately. So a parking lot is usually a good way of, you know, handling that.  record it for later.

4:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

4:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And putting together this exercise, I went back to some materials. I also did a little bit of analysis on the pilot interviews.  And do you see my screen? Yeah. Yeah. On the A lot of interviews and basically I understand it is a simplification, but it's an editable simplification.  can change it right now.

5:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, nice to change it.

5:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Go ahead.

5:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess it's not compliance. I was like, my point is because I think it's, it can be anybody in the company.  I think that's what our, our goal is, is how do we make, you know, Romeo, like who has no background and ESG, like enable the company to be ESG compliant.  So I think it's, so it's like people or individuals, you know, I could be something doing that. Keep like, and then like, can put another one, objective of being ESG compliant or like, or continuously.  managing ESG, then with a simplified easy to use guided platform, something there, or like continuous management or something like, yeah, continuous management.  I think actually, there was, we actually did something like this, Yvonne, I don't know if you remember, way in the beginning with what was the guy's name from eggs.

6:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Is it John Walter?

6:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  John Walter? Yeah, John Walter. had like actually a session with John Walter what he did. Have you seen that?  He did like a whole mirror where he did like our strategy and all of that.

6:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  don't know. And I feel like he's still...

7:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  something related to this. just reminds me of this, but I can't what we wrote to, which is probably a bad sign, but it was something.  whole board somewhere there.

7:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, do you know where that board is by chance? I can try to dig it out.

7:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I have it, I have it. The reason why I'm bringing this here is because there's two aspects to it.

7:21 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  The first one is as we need to stack our assumptions as we get to work on them, right? So this is like an initial assumption and it's not supposed to be super comprehensive because otherwise the exercises get too big, but like a working definition of basically what this means.  because we want to serve the whole company, in the end, it's difficult to figure out specific pain points of different people that make different decisions inside of the company, right?  And compliance officers is... one of those roles and they have specific pain points which are different from cultural managers like Abby from yesterday or others and the idea is that the more granular we can get on this stuff the easier it is to connect specific decisions to their needs because the idea is that we want to help them achieve something that already do right this is much easier than getting them to do something that they don't want to get right.

8:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah there so I think that's you know compliance and sustainability officers. I'm dead. and if it's off or like non-skilled workers, I don't know if you could say that, skilled workers, you know, in their objective of being ASI using a simplified.  you know, like, so like, like you, like this would be like Zendetta, right? They don't really know, and then they want to just be complete, and then they want like a guided platform, and then for ones that have skilled, so it's kind of almost like skilled and non-skilled, right?  Like a non-skilled workers could be like that.

9:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yes, yes. Which also hints at the possible split inside of our ICP, because what was her name?

9:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Abby?

9:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  No, not from yesterday. think it's from Acre Marine, I think, believe me. Biomerane, Lars?

9:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Guy, Lars. Maybe horizon, it was a lady. We should have one there, yeah. Yes, yes. Glasses.

10:03 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yes, and that's Aqua Horizon, that's Mari.

10:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, yeah, Mari, yes, correct.

10:09 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, as we talk to these different people, we realize that they are at different stages of, you know, experience, and they have different needs and work at different companies.  And one of the difficult things to do is if we have this kind of all-encompassing view of all of them, it's very difficult to isolate specific decisions.  Like what the Mari wants is probably different from what the Bryant wants, right? And unless we can kind of see these things separately, we will try to develop something that serves both public equally, what audiences equally, and that is really difficult and it has a low chance of success because there's a lot of quirks and specific details.  So the first invitation and is that if we can, for this exercise, I understand that Fortify needs to serve the whole company, but even as a kind of a go-to-market approach, like where do we begin, where are the people inside of the company that really get the pain points we're addressing, it's useful to have this kind of idealized avatar that is specific, right?

11:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and I think it's also a timing aspect of it, because I think this, I feel like there's like E and then there's S and G, and it seems like a lot of the G's just want the workflow tools, and then the E's just wanna pass the ISO audit, right?  It's a little bit also different, and there's more E's, and I actually see E as whether you can even grow in terms of scalability there, and we kind of have both, and I feel like,  Like, if you think in terms of timeline, like if we can get E up and running quicker, that's kind of the thing that you wouldn't change too much of.  But then the G, you might need to tailor a little bit based off of like how one person does it or another person, but the compliance map itself, it doesn't change so much.  It might be the processes within the compliance map that might need to change a little bit while we try to figure it out.  But I do think the next six months are like, we're not going to be able to replicate everything perfectly.  You know, like we have to like try to get all of the companies on it, meaning tailoring it a little bit for them to be on it.  And then from that experience, kind of understanding, okay, what what can be the same. So when we sell to future ones, we're not changing them, you know, like we understand and then like go from there.  So I think there is a little bit of a, I agree. I think like they always say in the beginning, like, you know, don't do things that scale in the beginning while you really figure it out.  And then once you figure it out, then you scale it. So I feel like the next six months will be kind of a little bit of like, don't, you know, we're not going to be able to scale everything.  I think. E we might be able to, but I think on the G side we might need to like play around a little bit.  But yeah, that's just the thinking. No, I think it's very, very, makes a lot of sense.

13:12 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So it's interesting that the roadmap as a mental model is useful for many things, right? It's useful for in terms of what kind of product we're building, which is the sort of roadmap we're thinking about.  It's also useful to think about how we are going to take by different markets, right? So we begin with the E because their pain point is more pressing and then later we use that to move into the G or move into the S, right?  Or we can also use the roadmap mental model for, you know, entering different industries. There's many layers to this.

13:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We will focus more on the product.

13:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But at that point you brought up that we suspect right now we have a strong suspicion that the E's are  you know, more willing or have a more pressing need for this, it's a really valuable insight because it will help us prioritize things, right?  We cannot do everything at the first time at the same time. So just to kind of get to a working definition that we can use for the rest of these exercises, could we perhaps and not take away the other ones but just highlight which of these one postage from each column, can we, could we do that?  For the, is this for the product development, like the product map, you mean?

14:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, yes. And then, like, I think if you think about like the media one would be, I guess would be the non skilled workers being ESG compliant there, because that's probably the one that we're going to launch the fastest.  You know, that's the one that we want to launch in January. So to have the product matching that will be important.  I think the G ones, because they're not going for ISO, it's more flexible in time. It's more like, you know, they're willing to test different areas and do that.  They're not trying to take the whole platform at once. So yeah. And on the last column, which one do you think we should focus on?

15:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It doesn't mean that we can never work on those other things, but just for this exercise.

15:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it would be the middle one, then a centralized platform where they can plan to enact because you would need that to be able to pass the ISO.  Perfect.

15:47 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So this whole, you know, digital product thing oftentimes forces us and it's uncomfortable to make these imperfect decisions that we're like, I'll need to revisit this later.  But for now, we are relatively comfortable with the idea that we will help mostly non-skilled non-skilled workers, perhaps around the compliance field, being ESG compliant.  And the way we'll do that, we'll help them, is with a centralized platform where they can plan, do, check, and act on the requirements.

16:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

16:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Again, this is a very, it should be a very open discussion. mean, this decision of, it has a bit more of a business flavor to it.  But Ivan has been working on this for a while, Mauricio also has a lot of context. I mean, your questions or comments are welcome here, right, if you have something to add.  Yeah, little bit to me.

16:55 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Got it. Yeah, yeah. Good start.

16:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Perfect. Okay, this arrow side and basically, okay, so we just have a common model of how this thing works.  We'll have this admin view that maybe this compliance officer or the junior compliance officer. We'll figure it out, figure it out.  They will have this admin view and they will use this admin view to ask for information.

17:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I call it designated responsible because there will be somebody designated, like as part of the ISO, you need to designate someone responsible for it.  it's like, yeah.

17:38 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's very good to use the same language they'll be using. So ISO provides exact, it's a really good way of putting it.

17:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I know this model seems simple enough, almost not look like a model, but basically is what happens, right?  This person, this actor will ask for information or feed information into the integrity hub.

18:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  get back to the to the admin view, right? Which means that we need some way basically the basic ingredients of this.  We need some way of, you know, sending requests out into the world, check on their status, and when you come back to us, we'll need to find them and check if they are done.  On a very basic level where it comes to interaction, this is kind of what happens.

18:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, okay.

18:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And now we, so I took the transcripts from the pilot interviews I've participated in. And I used Proplexity to help me figure out some patterns and some common themes.  And I've highlighted them here. I'll think it'll be faster if you guys just try to read it than me just reading it back to you.  And then we can just discuss what things I'll stick out the most for you. You want me to put a timer for maybe five minutes and we do this on our own?  Sounds good.

19:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK.

19:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Whenever it says NA, it means that that thing was not exclusively stated in the transcript. I'm just looking at hydro rain.

19:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  At least there's some AI notes probably from Romeo. If you want to try to get like, because I just noticed he's at least in that one for hydro rain.  don't know. We kind of played that. Yeah.

20:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Thank Yeah, I do have notes from that, it's just, it didn't catch so much this thing. Thank Thank If you're done and just waiting for the timer, you can just signal and we cut the time.  Okay. So looking at this, what stands out the most to you? Thank in terms of expectations from customers.

23:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's all different. Okay.

23:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, hard to summarize it.

23:15 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  yeah, lots of different stuff.

23:17 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  I think everyone wants to have their own process.

23:20 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Like they currently have it. They just want it digitalized, which is a bit not what we want, I guess.

23:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Mm-hmm. What else? else? Well, there's a lot about work processes and automation that they talk about, like avoiding manual processes.  In terms of ISO certification, there's three mentions of, three explicit mentions of ISO and only one of them seems to be about the ESG one.

24:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and I think that makes sense because the way I started selling it was to compliance officers. So a lot of the compliance officers are not automatically going to have the 37,001.

24:38 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So that's why we have a bias towards that.

24:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I would say the original ones, but the new ones that are kind of coming in, I think they also want the E, like Cognite's not on here and Cognite's probably the one that came in.  Also, we just closed another series D company called ARDOC a day or two ago. So I think 37,000 in one has been kind of also that's more of my background so I've been kind of selling that more but I do believe that there is a growth area and where we're missing a lot of content is the E and then since Cognite really wants to have the E.  think they're like if we're able to get Cognite the E it would also open a lot of doors for the G I think.  Based on more recent conversations.

25:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like if you think about urgency like Cognite is actually going to pay us before even starting because they want to use the budget up for this year.  So they're like, okay, we want this. I'm going to pay.

25:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So they're one of the ones who want to move the quickest and they kind of have like a business urgency, which is also why.  To prioritize them too because if we get them on correctly, then it will be good there.

26:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, uh, one of the things that also before I say this, uh, do you have other things that you want to.  Point out, yeah, I have something that caught my attention.

26:17 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  So, maybe for board the part of the platform, are there, or I said, improving conflict, sorry, mutual balance needs of advanced users, but with more casual users.  Um, I don't know that comes to mind, maybe in the first beginning, uh, of, you know, the onboarding part is like, uh, had some two questions about, you know, what, where do you, uh, working or maybe, uh, of assessment if, you know, that a regular common user or the  thing like that to feel for the user to have a feeling that you are being welcoming, you're not going to do more than you should do.  So it's a kind of a specify that your role in the platform. In a sense of things from the beginning, start talking about this is simple.  This is not going to take you a lot of time and you are responsible for that since from the beginning.

27:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Because if you start work, if I start working on the platform at first because I tested, so as a completely non-savvy user, I thought it would be complicated because it's not my field of expertise.

27:48 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  more complicated in the sense that, oh my god, I have to do a lot. Yeah. So I think, of course, we can

28:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  uh tell that on the marketing side of you or just inside of you of course we are going to do that we are already presented that but I don't know I think the platform should say something yeah yeah like and I kind of I think it is like you know that's how I point is like we got do we jump right into it right like we jump straight into controls we jump into all of these things but there's maybe a little bit of a hand holding and that's kind of like if we went back to like you know the the first one um the roadmap that that we had um that's kind of like you know where the orange part is um if you go left uh um to where I am uh go left a little bit more right here like I think that's the difference when like you know I was kind of hesitating between like I would like it to be the a simplified easy to use you know guided platform you know like that would be like the ultimate vision of where we are which would probably  help kind of what you're talking about now in terms of bringing you know making it a lot easier for you to do but in the short time I feel like we're going to end up being a centralized platform where like all the information is there and then we almost manually have to walk you through the process as like a helper rather than that but that's kind of the feeling like I would love to get it to a simplified easy to use platform where we don't like it almost becomes like a you know product led growth they can follow through and do it themselves without any intervention but I do feel like at least in the short term we're going to have to kind of intervene and help I would guess and I believe that makes sense for the software right this is a this is the kind of solution that has potential to become really intertwined with the way they operate and that means it's very context dependent right each company runs in its own specific way with its own quirks

30:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, yeah, to me it makes a lot of sense that simplification is not easy, it's actually difficult and it should not be the first goal, it should be like a north star we keep pursuing but not the first thing we do.  But there are other ways of making things easier for people that don't necessarily hinge on being simple. So, sometimes things are just clear, well explained, you are not overwhelmed with a lot of options, know, there's things that we can do that are kind of an added layer that you can put on without changing the whole architecture of shopping.  Got it. So, I'll move on to the right unless you want me to explore something else. No.

30:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

30:59 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, Well, I see Abby is adjusting here the roadmap. Is this directionally correct? was based on my notes from, I think, session one, Monday.  Yeah.

31:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I would almost add go-by-month, though, because I think it's going to like, because I feel like we have to onboard some pilots in month one and then month two, and then month three, so that, and then that's kind of the same, like, I don't know if it's for each of the quarters.

31:37 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Kind of copy that across.

31:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then so it's like, test V1, test, ideally, most likely, it would be like, you know, test one or two pilots, you know, and then,  And I'll know more because I have a meeting with Cognite this week where they actually want to go through their plan and look at when the board meetings are and when they need to do other between then.  And then we need to see. So and then, yeah, and then if you say develop scalable product, I think.

32:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  That's the that it signals the end of the task, not the beginning. Yeah. The end.

32:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Then what is Q3? When is July? July would be here? August. Yeah.

32:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then, yeah, acquire funding for more growth would be. That's July.

33:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess August. By the beginning of August, we should have a scalable product before we go to funding round.

33:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  That makes sense.

33:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They will want to see a scalable product and they'll want to see all of our clients onboard it and see how many are there.  I would say we need to start onboarding and then we have the complete onboarding. Or complete and then, right by here, then I think there's a, and then there's like also like CSRD.  Yeah.

34:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, first point, we should complete on-boarding, where do we get the insight to develop the scalable products? Because we need time between clients use it, we need to learn from them, and then we need to specify the new actions, and then we need to work on them to develop the scalable products.  That's a good point.

34:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know how, I guess it's like, ideally after we test one to two pilots, and we tested with Cognite, we should be able to onboard all of them quickly, I would hope, because by then you'll hope you have a lot of, well, that said, this is like, this is like, if you were to change the two colors, maybe change it to a green or something, we already have a green, but like, because this is like E, and then you also have a lot of the other ones, which would be the G side, which is maybe...  orange, right? So we also need to test that there. They're developing AI around there. Yeah, so I don't know.  So yeah, complete onboarding, guess. Ideally, it would be April, right? at least they're on, like, when you say complete, does it mean that they're on our platform or they've gotten certification and they're like up and running?  Or is that when you say complete onboarding, does that just mean that they've actually logged in and they're starting using it, I guess, as my, how do you define that?

35:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yes, this is also, I think it was one of the questions. What do we mean? In my, because this is, there's no right answer.  It's just a matter of making a decision for us, for the business, for Fortify. What do we consider to be an onboard client?  Yeah, so maybe we don't be just, like, on board and then we have them, like, go to paid.

36:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you know, are we able to start, you know, onboarding them? March is already, like, I'm already going to start talking to them at the end of January, right?  I set up all these meetings with them at the end of January, so that, like, we have February and we have March.  Is that, like, giving them two months to onboard when we first, you know, or are we able to onboard?  I don't know. Okay, so this is a question we have, which is, how long do we need to onboard?

36:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And we also must know what is our definition of an onboarded client. Okay, so I think there's basically two, you probably noticed that I put three different lanes.

37:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  J, on board, Stryce. Stryce is the only one that wants S right now, so oops.

37:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So when you think, as you move them around, when you think about, you probably have a picture in your mind of what you mean by onboarding, what is that you think when you think about onboarding?

37:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  When I think about onboarding, I think it's like we are ready to test with them. Like they're able to start using our tool to test the functionality of our tool.  But in order to do that, we have to have the right material on our tool, which we still don't have for E.  I'm just getting all the policies and procedures and all of that stuff so that we can launch it.

37:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And we have to have our tool ready. I need to create new controls for E. We need to develop the new controls for E.

37:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We need to test it on some pilot customers. So there's a lot to do, I guess, so that they're ready to start actually testing it out, like sending out policies, procedures, or training.  or employees getting some employee feedback back that the employee portal is working. Yeah.

38:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay. So this is very useful because there's so many things they can do inside of the platform, and each client is slightly different, and they might want to begin at different points of the platform.

38:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

38:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's useful for us to have at least a shared understanding of what to be a task that tells me, oh, this client is using the platform.  So there's a very simple, but I think also simplistic view of this, which would be, oh, if we have a call with this client and we give them login credentials, they are onboarded.

38:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay? So this is very easy to know if it's a yes or no.

38:49 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah. it doesn't really tell us much if they are getting value from the experience. Right? in- I would say maybe once they deploy something to a larger.  audience outside of themselves, right?

39:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If they deploy part of our product to employees or they deploy part of a policy to management for a sign-off, know, or if they're actually using the tool, I would say that's kind of the onboarding thing.  Okay.

39:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Perfect.

39:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, this is useful because it's also, it can also help us, you know, focus on some efforts.

39:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And how many clients are these? The ones we want. Right now we have around 11. I think it'll be like, but I think one of them is gone because they merged with another company.

39:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So like 10 right now. Okay.

39:35 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we plan on around March onboard 10, 10 clients. And by onboarding clients, guess it would be no, yeah, because Stryce Cognite is one.  But yeah, maybe eight to 10, like because there might be other two ones, yeah.

39:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it.

39:54 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'll just write eight to 10 because you can see how this inform like goals we keep talking about for later yeah okay so we will want to onboard 10 clients on the G layer yeah we'll want to onboard strides on the S layer and we want to convert some pilots we want to convert pilots to paid on all them okay yeah I'll remove this one CRC CRC SRD is E?

40:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  this is no this is the more how do I say like in order in order to kind of go for funding we need to one have AI on our product so I know Mustafa was looking into how to get like you know grant funding for AI we need to build AI into our tool in order to go for funding and then we need to map our ISOs to CSR D and that should be before we go you know we go into into funding so you know maybe CSR  mapping is done by this, because then it's a more of a scalable product. Also, in terms of regulatory, around this time, people are going to start worrying about CSRD, so we need to have that in our tool.  Earlier, we can kind of convert it the better. I'm just looking at this timeline, making maybe so we don't have enough time or we have to do it at the same time.

41:22 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I'm not sure.

41:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

41:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, I'll just call it something else here, the X, and send it back, okay? Develop a scalable product. So, this developer scalable product, this is something that would be happening.

41:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think from the start and then also converting the pilots to paid, right after that, we should have a story around that.  So, I guess X is what do we need to have in place?

42:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So before we're going to have the funding, you know, before we're going to get, you know, external funding, these are the things we should have in place.

42:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it.

42:14 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Perfect. How do you feel? How do you feel about this event? I don't know.

42:25 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  It looks okay to me, but I mean, it's more details, each of these details to be a bit more precise, but it looks okay to me.  Okay.

42:35 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And you, Mauricio? Yeah, I think it's, as Alper said, from that, we're going to go for more details.

42:46 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  and then, you know, just share the tasks and everything. it's good stuff. Okay.

42:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So, we actually kind of jumped the gun a little bit on this one, but we Let's keep moving forward with it.  So right now, okay, I'll just let that be finished.

43:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I just say that there's content that needs to be developed and finalized before we can go into these. So that's what I'm doing now over Christmas and everything is getting all the content ready so that we can actually test.  It's the same thing, we don't have all the content. Developed right so that's probably also with the CSRD mapping.  When you say content, just to be sure you're talking about the same thing.

43:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  When you say content, what do you mean?

43:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I mean like the policies, procedures, trainings like all of the controls. So everything that behind the compliance map, the compliance map is pretty much the same.  I think we might need to create another box within risk assessment, but it's all the content behind the compliance map.

44:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay. So, these are our basic intentions at this point, but like Ivan said, there's a lot of complexity behind these things.  We shouldn't be fooled by the size of the post-its, because some tasks will just be longer.

44:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's just basically what things we want to have done by then, right?

44:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  One thing that stands out. to me is if we onboard these clients around this time, we have less time to convert whatever we learn from them into the scalable product, which is a natural consequence.  It just makes sense that we need to be aware that where are we onboarding clients?

45:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We're onboarding clients to test it out and learn from them, right?

45:28 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we need to consider how to implement those ideas. Yeah, and part of this idea, I'm also getting pressure from our investors like, when are you going to start making revenue, right?

45:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And part of converting these pilots is to get something ideally ready that they're willing to convert or find out if they're not willing to convert, right?  Then we need to move on to some next ones, but a little bit of where it's coming from too.

45:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And also we need to convert pilots.

46:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Ideally I guess you know I think about it it's ideally earlier because by the end of the summer we should have like yeah by the end of June we should have them converted at least like knowing who's paying or who's not paying and who's going to join and continue on with that so.

46:19 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Which means we also need some strategy to move pilots into paying customers. This doesn't need to be super you know complex or it doesn't need to be a bunch of slide decks this is not the big four consulting sort of thing.

46:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah I agree I have a strategy for like for the E1 the ones I want to go to ISO I think it's it's like we would like if they need to pay before we bring the auditors in so that's that makes it a little bit easier but for the ones who don't want to go for ISO it's like at one point it's like I think after they.

47:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  deploy a bit then we need to say okay now do you want to continue you know three months after they've done their first deployment or something you know it do they find it helpful or something like that got it perfect so now we'll go to detail a little bit more of what's what's done and what's what's missing right and bringing everyone with me yeah so basically and I think I think it will be useful to to get your views on this and I'll just want to show you that we'll make a list of what's done what we don't have yet okay and the blue things are around the admin view the yellow things that are around the important view the pink thing is around the external view this is what we're working towards there's stuff that's like subsections and specific  screens and other processes behind this, but basically this is it. Does everybody agree on this? It's looking really quick.

48:17 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Somebody else said something, I'm not sure I called you. Looks okay to me. Okay.

48:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I didn't put this into any specific order, I'm just listing them.

48:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We are missing some sections that haven't been created yet, like the audit one we're missing and then the management view.  What is the management? The management reporting, I guess, sorry, management reporting. The reporting aspect of it and reporting. And then we have other stakeholders, like a, might be able to delete, those are the, so these three are boxes that we haven't created.  yet it's kind of on the list to create these three.

49:05 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Right, so just tell me more about this other stakeholders thing please. Yeah, as part of the Norwegian Transparency Act which is the S that we'll have to do with Streis, they require you to engage your customer base along with your supplier base along with your employee base.

49:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  they require a little bit more than like a typical ISO there.

49:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Got it, got it. Okay, and on the employee view, is this basically correct? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so we have...

49:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think there were missing in there like a home page for employees, but I'm not sure. that's what I was going to say.  was going to say that too, actually, something like...

49:56 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  did say? That's the employee part though?

49:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Home page or... dashboard or to do list or something do list slash aggregation yeah it's it's an aggregate of all these like an overview of all these other yeah so we eliminate this thing because this is kind of it the way I see it right what would be then the employee portal like an employee I think like having a home like a page when you go into is a home page saying like like room I think it's kind of like the home page that Romeo had had made and then you have that yeah like tabs around like like if want to deep dive in each of those a little bit more and then you would see that yeah so isn't this like a subsection of the employee portal like under the employee portal yeah I guess that could if you call like if it's that I don't know employee portal is just a name or if it's the home page then yeah it could be the same yeah it could be called the employee home page right and then that could be included into that or the employee portal yeah I guess depending on what's what's in playport

51:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I'm not sure how you mark it, but basically everything on the on the yellow is a page, right?  So what is employee portal? The first one here is this a page or just a label for all of the others?  If the home view, I think it's I think the same.

51:18 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I think, yeah, OK, then we are talking about the same thing.

51:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, OK, in that sense, I'll just undo this deletion because I think it's better if we use the same language you guys use.

51:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'll just I'll just adapt the way you describe this. Got it. Perfect. So for now, we have all of these things.

51:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There is like another view, but I don't know like external view is that like because in terms of the external ones, and this is where you have like the integrity hub, you have like supplier portal.  Um, question mark, you know, like, um, then there's also, um, wrong, wrong color. Um, there's also, uh, board board members or community members.  There's other people. there's other stakeholders that will need to access, you know, even like customers. Like, yeah, I don't know if you just put stakeholders right now, but there will be, there is a way for like external ones to communicate with us in there.  So I think I just need to figure out what how to do that. Yeah.

52:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  One of the ways we've discussed, uh, how to do this in the past was to have all the different views of the same integrity hub, right?  Yeah. So it would be basically the integrity hub and like integrity hub slash. Investor integrity hub slash customer something like that.  And this would allow us to use the same thing, but just Have different information different content on the same thing.  Yeah, I like some kind of login No, I think that's fine too. Yeah So so in that sense, I'll put underneath the integral integrity Does it make sense to you and do you agree with this view?  Yeah, I'm fine with that.

53:27 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I'm just it's a question of how will someone come to this view I mean, is it so powerful or is it just some random URL that someone enters but It's like if you like to think about our supplier questionnaire, right?

53:40 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Like our supplier question that we send out.

53:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  How are they going to risk, you know, like Even like you I said question. How do you log in and fill it in?

53:51 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So current current implementation will be I think We'll have it soon is you just click on a link and you're there on that website  really link you get via email and that's it you fill the form in and you submit it and I think it's all for now that suppliers need to do right for now I guess.

54:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  are some like there are some like I'm seeing requirements now for suppliers might need to review a training or they need to sign off on a document so they're kind of like the employee review but they need to like sign off on the supplier code of conduct like Mari was just talking about this there so.  Then we'll have to probably create a supplier portal also seem like we don't play portal yeah in that case yeah yeah then they'll need to sign off on like policies trainings and communications here or and then like questionnaire something like that like that possibly there yeah yeah so all of these things they might have things underneath

55:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  them right so yeah I think to me this has been quite useful in the sense of kind of giving a feeling of how much work there's still to do and putting me more at ease with the idea that we want to do all things at the same time or we want them the same level of detail at the same time or stuff like that yeah mm-hmm so I'll just decrease these a little bit guys just yeah no more OCD so for the now since we need to organize our world map and figure out what we need to do what what's still missing it's useful to see what we have right yeah and and then we will figure out what what we are missing I think for the time we have and the amount of sections we need  to go through we need to make some choices here so my suggestion is can we take two minutes each to figure out what three of these sections we would like to focus on and maybe do a little voting on it so I'll make three dots underneath okay these ones are for Ivan these ones are for Abby and you just take a couple of minutes and then you drag them on where you want or what what do you think is the most relevant here all right relevant for what like relevant or most important that we create or what perfect okay thank you for asking because it really matters assuming that we won't be able to discuss all of them right now which ones do you think that we should discuss first I think that's the well like I guess

57:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  What do you mean, like, we discussed first as in, like, prioritized in January, like, that we need to get moving on, I guess?  Like, the most important to have ready by January deployment? Is that what you mean? All right. That could be it, yes.

57:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  There's the, for instance, let's say, let's say this, let's say, even as a specific question around, I don't know, audits.  I don't know, okay, I'm just imagining here. And for even audit, it's a bit more nebulous. I really need more clarity on what body it will have.  And let's say, in that situation, even place a vote on that thing, right? And for Abby, the thing that she's more unsure about the things she would like to discuss here at this session is more around third-party management, should she drags it here.  And eventually we realize that even also has questions about those. So we'll just begin with the most impactful discussion, which would be the thing that matters to both of you.  Does it make sense?

58:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I guess, are we only doing it for admin view right now then.

58:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  The idea is to do for all of them, but surely we won't have time because we take a little bit to discuss each thing.  Did you copy a vote? Did you copy a vote? No, I just move it to the next section here, I just want to move on.  Good, good. So I mean, dashboard is something we need to discuss because both of you would like to address it and then let's try to do the other ones.  So about the dashboard, are the main points of? We don't have one, I guess.

59:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We don't have one that's linked to the controls yet or linked to the data output.

59:32 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We have a design for it, I guess, and then idea, but that's all. We don't have a strict definition of what it will be in the dashboard.  We have some idea and we have plans to just make it same as Power BI or something like that, but currently we don't know specifics of what will be there on the dashboard, how complex will it be and so on.  currently it's a bit still unknown until we complete other parts which is loaded. because to have the airport you need to have the daytime to have data you need to have these other columns implemented which they are doing right now.

1:00:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What kind of things so my understanding from what you told me is that okay there's something for the dashboard is not the complete unknown but at the same time you can only see the dashboard you know outputting information if the other sections are ready and recording information is this correct yeah yeah like the test management like because I think the dashboard will be what's actually interesting for people like like in the beginning a lot of it's like I just want somebody to tell me what it needs to be done right like so then they don't have to go to the compliance map if they have an upload you need to do these tasks so tasks have to be assigned there you know these are your incoming requests that are there you know these are the dashboards of what you've deployed there so there's a lot of things that links to there.  Do we know what kind of tasks we will fit into that. So it's everything around the, I think the controls, right?

1:01:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it's like, have you deployed certain things? you set up your policies for anti-bribery and corruption?

1:01:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  know, have you sent out the communication?

1:01:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's a policy, right?

1:01:16 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Or? Yeah, but it's a task that you need to do, right?

1:01:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So think about task management.

1:01:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But it's related to all of these boxes.

1:01:23 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So there will be a task, create a policy, deploy training.

1:01:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, Manage a third party, yeah.

1:01:30 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Approve a control for anti-bribery and corruption. So I guess it will be all of these columns will somehow be aggregated into the dashboard, right?

1:01:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  To do this from all of these columns, yeah, yeah.

1:01:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Exactly.

1:01:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we will need a list of tasks for each section. And those tasks will be aggregated on the dashboard, right?  Yeah. Got it. I know there's more to discuss on this thing, but just to not get stuck on it.  So around third-party management, Abby, what would you like to discuss about this thing?

1:02:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The thing is that I think I need to update the process slightly. What do we have right now? So we have a process already update.  We have a process, but I feel like it's missing a few pieces after I talked with Mari from Auker Horizons.  And then we both update the process, but we also need to update it for E environment, because we have it right now set up for G, all the controls, but we don't have it for E, and I need to figure that out.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. What's your view on this event? What do you about third-party?

1:02:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What would you like to know? I know the current implementation, but I'm not familiar with the delay.

1:03:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I mentioned that there are updates and that it is different, but I don't know details about it, so we need to discuss it and see what's different and how will it be different for someone else, although we need to also be careful not to customize it too much for that company that is just giving us feedback, so I need to be careful about that also.

1:03:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, this feels like a really important thing that will pop up over and over again in this project, which is the tension between solving issues for a specific client without increasing the complexity of the platform to a level that we cannot manage.  Yeah, no, I think I agree with that.

1:03:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  think, but like the process that we copied was like a one and a half hour discussion with Rui to put it together.  It hasn't had the depth of thought through of what it can actually be and what it should look like.  like I just forgot because like I forgot I you know you're we're supposed to be checking with other people we just didn't which is part of the pilot right to get feedback on what should be done in that.  So there are a whole section about sanctions and politically exposed people I just forgot which makes sense that we should add into it but I agree with you is the tension of how much do we tailor it versus how much is like best practice versus how much is minimum so I think that's something that we'll have to have that tension of.

1:04:26 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  I would suggest something for the next interactions with the clients that we have a structure questionnaire about what you want to know from them because now we are just presenting the platform they are kind of using and then they are going to test again so and then we are going to have a very structured feedbacks which helps us to be more precise because from the interviews that show on coined some thoughts and other things.  It was hard for us to grasp or to group information, which is fine because that's for the further interactions with clients, we should destruct it a little bit more.  Yeah, I agree.

1:05:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it's also been a little bit difficult because they haven't had a product to actually test. They actually have a product they can click around with.  Ideally, we even build feedback into the product, being like a little box that they can add comments to and gather data.  So definitely, I agree with you.

1:05:35 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, and something just to reinforce this. There are ways of, and we can help you with that if that's useful, there are ways we can turn this, because there are different kinds of customer interviews.  There's customer discovery interviews, there's customer development interviews, there's a user testing, all of these things are slightly different. And one of the things that could be useful, and it doesn't really need a platform to show them is an expertise elicitation session.  Just we ask them, how do they work? And we don't show them anything. And we just want to see how they work.  And we do this with enough people. 10 to 15 is good enough. That we see, oh, everybody starts in this way.  Everybody wants to be able to link to something in SharePoint, stuff like this. And from that we have a really solid foundation, instead of focusing on the technical application of their specific process.  This is something that could be planned and there's best practices around how to collect best practices.

1:06:41 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  We can help with that.

1:06:42 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, that sounds good. Pretty flexible on that. So for controls, Abby says we have basic controls for G. We might need some more controls for G.  We will need to anonymize if it's blowing.

1:07:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  and environmental controls okay still on controls even do you have questions or comments on what's ready and what's was ready okay and about reporting how do you see it even it's just I both say for reporting and auditing I just want to know how important it is and when will it come because the and how will it look I mean I just want to know and have a feeling of what's what's in there basically I know something but I put them in because those two were not touched yet at least from my side in a way that I don't know the details or anything about it so that's why I put them in because all of the other ones we mentioned we are already working on something I know we'll need to update them but these are these are not familiar to me at least not in the details got it yeah the reporting on audit will be a little bit simpler because we don't need like a company wide

1:08:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  employment as part of that it's more like a document storage for these or maybe some you know tasks and some questionnaires internally that you can use to document things so it's a more like kind of a document trail for both of these and then we have to think about like what can be like templates for reporting or what eventually AI can bring in to pulling the reporting together but for reporting on audits more I think at this point it's going to be it won't probably come in until right before the audit for for some of them so February March time because you can still do some of this offline you don't need to deploy across for the audit or the reporting so that's yeah so that's why but yeah I agree like I'm getting more and more content I'm hoping I'll be able to have I really have some information for audit and reporting for the east side but I just want to put it all together and then I can share it with you guys or I think we might have that another session which I'll like break it down what it could actually look like so we can design some pictures for it and then Romeo can make

1:09:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  got it. this, the idea is that we will take these things, you know, people's these cool things, and we'll later place them on the roadmap for the 2025, but because we already started doing that, we'll just drag them over, over here, right?  Let me bring everyone to me, over here. So, but before we move into that, because that thing will generate some debates, and we need the time to have that debate.  Before we move to that, do we have big questions around the employee view or external view?

1:09:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, just that comment that I made about, like, it's kind of like reporting it audit-wise, not as worried about it, is that it's, you can hide it, or you can do it very manually, right?  But where employee view is like every employee in the company will get it, which is why I think it's important that the compliance officer or sustainability officer, I think for them, it's often their reputation, they're going in and they're bothering the company and they're getting them to do something.  So they're always a little bit hesitant around that and they always get a lot of pushback if it deploys and it's not nice and it's not very good at used.  But if you have an employee portal that's very easy to use, that's kind of cool and like whatever that employees aren't going to mind as much and they're going to think it's cool and then that's going to make the compliance and sustainability offer feel better that they can use the rest of our tool.  And so and it's also becomes like a kind of viral effect in that employees feel comfortable then they might talk about it to other people or they like it lands better, which is why I think that's actually like like that's more important than like reporting or audit because that could just be ugly on the background and you could still pass, you know what I mean?

1:10:56 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But there is some parts of like even like the training.

1:11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and like the different things that that lands well because that's kind of the face of the product to everybody even though behind the scenes it can be like a hot mess and like you know but like at least it looks kind of professional when it's going out to the board to the management or the employees.

1:11:18 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Got it got it to me that makes a lot of sense and this is also useful to explicitly say because whenever we we we need to prioritize stuff this probably means that employee portal is really at the top because employees are not incentivized like the tool whereas compliance officers and the pilot testers they probably are more open to experiment with the big stuff they know they're testing out a new product right.  Okay and about the external view I didn't update this yet. Is there anything that you know it's bring any of you or that you'd like to discuss further?  Well, I think it's the same thing that I was saying with employees, right?

1:12:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like if you think about external views like suppliers or companies that you do business with, the company isn't going to want to like businesses is business, right?  You don't want to piss off a supplier by giving them a bad process or making them fill in a questionnaire that doesn't work and like whatever, you know, because you want you want to have like good a good sense of business, same without your customers that they need to give some feedback or different things or like that you want them to have a user experience around that so that they it doesn't affect business, right?  Like if you're suddenly like demanding a supplier fill out a 30 page questionnaire or like get into a system that they can't get and then you'd be sending them reminders, but they're not able to get into the system and then it's awkward for them to use.  Like you don't want business people complaining, getting complaints from, know, that's also the worst thing for the compliance officer.  You know, suddenly the supply chain team is like this is a waste of my time.

1:12:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I don't like this.

1:12:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They raise it to the CEO and the CEO shuts down the project, right? So it's like whenever you're like external stakeholders, internal stakeholders, we just need to make sure that it really works for them on that.  So I think it's a good point of what you said. think you summarized the quick list. For things that affect themselves, they might be okay if like the UXGY doesn't totally work.  But for things that affect other people outside in the organization, that might reflect badly on them. So that's probably more important to get that right.

1:13:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so this is good because that's a prioritizing criteria. Criteria on the singular, don't know. Well, I think I wouldn't say I would say that when you say external, it's like anything that requires stakeholders not of the actual initial user.

1:13:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You know what I mean? So it's like,

1:14:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Board like you don't want to go to the board with like a  process because that's gonna make you look really unprofessional You don't want to go to management with you know our employees with a bad-facing product or suppliers like you yourself as me I can work with a bad-facing product as long as I know like I'm not gonna get crap from the other Stakeholders that I tend engage because the product isn't good if that makes sense Yeah Yeah Uh perfect, so zooming out and I'll just copy these Do we um do you think we'll finish in 15 minutes or do you guys need to end in 15 minutes or Should I just have another beating at four but I can move it back it because I'd rather prioritize this But it's more when you guys have you know free We can extend a little bit  But if we extend like 10, 15 minutes, I don't think it will materially change how much further ahead we can move in this one session.  So for now, I would just try to get the admin view onto the roadmap. And I mean, it's important to say that based on, because there's so much things we don't know about each section, this roadmap is a draft, right?  So maybe as development begins on some sections, we realize, oh my God, we need more clarity on something, right?  And it's easy to be expected. So we shouldn't take this roadmap as right now as a commitment to do these things in this order.  We should take this roadmap as a to-do list in terms of let me check if I know enough about each task or each module to feel relatively confident on this, right?  OK, so let's reduce this thing. Let's reduce the size. everybody's following me. Oh, you're not going to me? OK.  And OK. So based on that criteria, let's try to impress everyone else except the pilot.

1:16:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I don't know if you want to also copy in the email that I sent the other day, because I think it's also kind of matches with, or I can also do it too, with some of the thoughts.  Where are we? Yeah, the one they're saying, yes, Brett? Yeah, and I put it over here in the chat, because it kind of fits in.  Yeah, I don't know if you see it now.

1:17:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I see it, I see it.

1:17:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm just bringing other stuff here.

1:17:12 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay. Okay. Design. pretty much done, right, Ivan?

1:17:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it's only that deployment part that needs to be done, right? Yeah, but sorry, for which one?

1:17:53 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Number one on the right.

1:17:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You're design ready on January development. you see this box here? are we talking about this one here or follow-up is sorry yeah okay you're reading mail i'm reading the timeline on the q1 okay uh deployment select the people function yeah so uh this needs this is done in the design it's not done in the code for simplicity sake now currently it works it sends to everyone and we need to change it so that's yeah but that should be done in january right yeah yeah yeah and then and then the updated employee portal with like Romeo's design with the submissions working for at least for the g side i would say but we need to also update it with the e that's that that i have here so i have kind of say like and we have a design ready for this because Romeo made it we have new integrity hubs but we need to update the controls listed but that design is pretty ready updated compliance map with the plan do act thing that um that the i couldn't find design for this one when i went to the list can you send me the link or tell me  Yeah, the prototype, so I don't know how to decouple the prototype, but it's in in that. And then I have to add one more box there.  And then the dashboard updated to match controls. We have the design ready, but I don't know if we have actual that part.  The new content added.

1:19:21 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  This is actually, I think it was actually meant to be like, like this.

1:19:26 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  That word one is a bit more complex just to mention, because for dashboard will need to aggregate all bunch of stuff for the first version, we can make something seem, but let's discuss that in more details on some other meeting.  Okay, so.

1:19:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

1:19:49 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  This is just someone in January.

1:19:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  don't know. You know, you're saying that maybe I'm just putting a different order, I'm even do you feel that, you know.  All of these can be done in January, one to six at least. Hard to tell.

1:20:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Sounds okay in general, but can promise without going a bit deeper into the designs. I like to, because as I said, I went through the list, but I couldn't find design for all of the items, so I'll check the prototype and see what's in there.

1:20:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, if you check the prototype, and I think Romeo also has a link that put in the design chat yesterday, that has at least employee portal and then integrity hub in there.  So yeah, and then this one is in the prototype.

1:20:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But I saw the carbon mission there, that belongs to where?

1:20:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, that belongs in environmental documentation and controls here, this one right there. So yeah, so that's going to be in the control part for the environmental one.  Okay, sorry.

1:21:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I'm thinking there's three, for each section, there's three layers of clarity, which is business decision, user experience, and development, right?  Each section needs to have like completion at these three different points. And we have, I haven't counted, we have perhaps 17 or 18 different sections, and they are split across three different dimensions, which are ESG, right?  And I think this is quite difficult to make sure we are coordinating correctly. So I'm thinking what would be the best way, but we will keep trying to do it this way.  So dashboard, dashboard, Ivan, you said that

1:22:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  add for V1 something is possible but still wouldn't be too connected with with data or yeah it it's for V1 so it depends on what we have for example currently the only to do is we have in the app our vendor to do so you can write to do this on your vendors for each vendor okay we can show that in the dashboard but but what do we show how do we show it we need to define all of these things in the dashboard we'll probably show some graphs maybe some numbers like completion percentages or something we need to define those numbers we need to define what and where will they show it and we are we can work only with what we have so if we only have controls implemented we cannot do I don't know some kind of third party we cannot show on the dashboard third part if we don't have it I mean we all understand that so that's that's what I meant by by that comment and of course dashboard will be something that we will work on of course we'll start with something simple and we will  that over time once we also get the user feedback on that because they'll probably users will want some customizability and so on over time which we should have but we shouldn't have maybe immediately because it will be too much work initially and so on and so on so I'd say this is something that we will build over time but we need to start with something simple so I would suggest we start with whatever we have implemented we just group those stuff a widget from each of these columns or and show it on on dashboard that that would already be in my opinion are nice nice feature okay so uh dashboard v1 with a widget we're not saying which one it is from each yeah but also I'm not sure what Abby had in mind but I think that was something along the line right Abby yeah I think like for like the biggest most important one will be the the training you can get like you know and then like around the control so any kind of information

1:24:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  around training and like controls will be the what would be the most important within the dashboard. But like if you're going to pick one then like just training completion is probably like like you know that that will be important for them to be able to track it and figure it out.  Training completion and what was the other one?

1:24:21 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And controls so anything related to the controls that we need to see.

1:24:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think it's like it's also the the task management part is very interesting on the dashboard is like more of like what do I need to do?

1:24:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  You know I want somebody to tell me exactly what I need to do but this is a very good point because perfect because the thing is we could we there's two ways of moving the dashboard right one way is a more prescriptive view just telling people what to do which is a to-do list and this is something that in terms of content is not too complex to make we just check out  are the requirements and we create like a template for lists of things people need to do, right? This also could be done in a way that is not super interlinked with other sections of the of the platform.  Ideally it would be, but we could start with something that is not super interlinked, right? So that's one approach to dashboard.  The other approach to dashboard is using it as an analytics view, right? This second approach, the analytics view, depends much more on data collection.  And it's difficult for us to feed data into it or data, never know. If we don't have the rest of the platform ready, collecting data, right?  So each of these sections, like the training, the dashboard, all of these sections, they're like little products, small products that need their own like decisions and prioritization.  And it feels that right now, the dashboard, we are at the stage that we can make an explicit decision on, let's move the dashboard.  this direction for now, because this will give us time to work on other things. Did it make sense? I don't know if I went too crazy on this.

1:26:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think so. I think there are some low-hanging fruits on that that we can just do it before it gets too complex.  And then I don't know if the widget from each letter, I think my initial idea of having ES and G all in one platform is maybe changing the ES and tab, because if you look at our pilots, are like, I only want the E, some are like S, there hasn't, and some are like G.  None of them have said I want ESG all at once, do you know what I mean? So most likely their dashboard will be only G stuff or only E stuff or only S stuff, because we haven't seen that yet.  That might be like a future thing that had emerged all of them or how to map all of them, being like, okay, now you've done this for E, now you could just map it to  But, but yeah, so I don't know if I answered the right question, but we only have a few more minutes.  what do you think we should? How should we continue on this? Or what do we need to continue? This I have to go to another call now soon.

1:27:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Or do we need more time this week?

1:27:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We could also try to do more time on like tomorrow at 2pm or something. Yeah, I do.

1:27:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I do have more time for other sessions. Before we make a decision on that on these last two minutes, was there any part of this process that we've been through right now that was better and you'd like to see more like visible for both of you.  And you'd like to see more of it and something that you think we should just remove in future sessions.  What was the most valuable part of this meeting we just had? I think.

1:28:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This thing in front is kind of a good kind of having a timeline of having this a little bit broken down.  Maybe we spend more time on the top part, that section on top, which parts of these have to be completed by a certain time to meet.  Because we haven't talked about audit. When should audit be completed? Probably by March the second month of March. I don't know that could be part of it.  I think this was good to visualize what do we need to do by when and work backwards to do that.  But it's also, and then maybe break it down even more, we, you know, like in my email from January, okay, we have some designs that are ready, but then some designs that we don't have ready, right?  So like, okay, what do we need to do for the designs that we don't have ready? Okay, when are you guys Brazilian team free to get that?  When do I need to get you the information by so that you can do this by the time that we need to do this?  you and then does that fit with holidays anyway, you know, so that we can work around that. I think a more detailed discussion around that could be good, but I do have some time, yeah, like starting like we could do another session from like two to four tomorrow to try to finalize this and have a final plan, because it would be good to have a good plan for like January, February, March.  So then we know there, but at least I feel like with if we go by the email that I sent with the design ready, that's pretty much ready.  At least there's, I was a little bit worried that Yvonne and his team wouldn't have anything to do in the beginning of January when when you're on holiday or when there is at least enough to do there and for them to start, right?  And then in the beginning of January, maybe me and Mal and Romeo can meet together and try to build the rest of the content for the other things, you know, before you come back from holiday.  So that then when they're done with that part, they can move. So yeah, but should I just send another because I  I should go. Yeah, the time you said.

1:30:05 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, should I send like two to four tomorrow?

1:30:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  can send. Yeah. Now does that work?

1:30:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  think we can move the meeting that we had in there.

1:30:16 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

1:30:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I have meeting at 3 to 3 30, but I guess we can we can figure something out. Okay.

1:30:24 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. No, that's fine.

1:30:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And one thing is maybe, Yvonne, can you have a look at the designs then?

1:30:32 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but if you can also, if the talking to design team now, if you can maybe pinpoint where so in this list that you see that have been pasted or pasted from email, can you please help me find all the designs or some of them?  It's clear. Okay. Policy simply portal I found in the Figma, but these new that I mentioned that are only in the prototype.  Can I see the can I see them in Figma not only No, it's like, so the prototype though, so the plant number four is what Pinar made.

1:31:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I may need to figure out how that Pinar did that in a prototype, but the other ones, the other team made.  And I think I think we already put it in the slack yesterday, Yvonne, if you want to look at it in the design, in the design part of Slack, you'll see the link that he said, then you'll find it there.

1:31:22 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I'll write, I'll write in the slack if I cannot find something. Yeah.

1:31:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But, But yeah, is that okay? it is, it is, or yeah.

1:31:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  You're free for the for the next one.

1:31:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think if we can like tomorrow, like look at this, the road map overall plan for 2025 a little bit more deeper.  So we know what it means for each of us and the availability and even like on the product side, right?  Like there's still a lot of content that needs to be developed. That's not kind of included in here. It's like, when do I need to get the content or who do I need to work with to kind of break down the  content too, because I do feel like I'm going to need a session with Yuxiao just in terms of all the new content I have, would kind of like we did with Rui before every section we'd go in and be like, okay, how does this map out for each of the new content we need, and then how do we design that?  And that needs to be kind of planned into our calendars too for January.

1:32:17 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  So that's some of the thinking.

1:32:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, but I'm going to run out and then we can talk tomorrow.

1:32:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, thank you.

1:32:26 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Do you need me also for something or that's it?

1:32:31 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  No, I just make sure what you asked was the links for the design where I do things.

1:32:36 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because I opened Figma and there on the left side I saw the new V2 versions for some stuff, so employee port integrity, how policy is carbon reporting, but I cannot find there, I didn't find there, I didn't look too much, but I couldn't find it on the list of pages.

1:32:53 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  The, for example, this one updated compliance map, for example.
