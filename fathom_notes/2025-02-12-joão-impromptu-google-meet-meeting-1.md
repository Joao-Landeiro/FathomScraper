0:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hey, hello. Hello. Breathe out.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Lots of meetings probably.

0:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  What?

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Lots of meetings probably, I said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, intense ones. So, do you want me to share the Figma or do you want to share the Figma?

0:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can maybe share the Figma, but let's be quick. I don't want to take too much of it. I I also came to go, we have our release for today's meeting and so on, so a bunch of other stuff.  Absolutely. We need to go through. But I think what you did is good, and I think we just need that part of approval and deployment, that part, but maybe we will be quicker if we just redo the existing stuff, do you think?  I know everything will look the same, so that's a bit to me. But maybe, yeah.

0:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm trying to find my Figma window. I see it but yeah but I don't know where it is on my computer so I'll stop sharing and open another one.  I think I got you. I think we kind of understand each other but it's good to have just this short column.  So yeah now I'll share my screen. Now I found it. So you said something about approval. Let me see.  And what you mean is should Romeo stop working on this or not?

1:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Hold on. I would say yes in my opinion. We can discuss it but I would say yes. I think it's more efficient right now and we can argue here but I think it's more efficient to.  uh to read you the existing controls as they as they currently are to just look similar to policies and just move forward with that okay but okay okay so what we do is just okay so let's say policies okay yes and we just you can even better even better take yeah but keep that picture in mind but go to iteration one page it's at the top yeah and then find the control that i shared with you okay just loading yeah but yeah i think we should do that layer that you wanted to show and zoom into controls part i'm not sure where is it uh we'll go to the left to the start is here top no up  Yeah, that's it perfect, but take a look at the top one. So basically Yeah, this is this was implemented right so more or less It's not perfect and we need to redo it But this this is the home page of control that you that you saw that I showed you now today I am the end of call and then the next page to the right is the page that you also seen So this is when you click on a specific control and then you come in here and here you do approve As far as I'm concerned the mail can take and I think I'll able to set this So Romeo can take this form part and just pick it into the policies layout and change maybe a couple of things that are specific to controls around it, but maybe we can start with that because that will Make our life a bit easier both to you and to us at this stage So you won't have to reimagine and redesign things right now which requires a lot of work on the design side also So we might get by with something like this for DMVP and then we should not discard with  we're trying to do, I like it. So we should probably continue working on it at stage two of this whole process.  But for now, maybe best we move quickly with this one, if you agree. No, I understood.

4:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what you would expect from this would be like a template?

4:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  You cannot go to the policies. You cannot go to the policies, what you started showing.

4:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so I don't use this design. I use that other design you just showed, right?

4:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, you can just replace the policy content with the form. can use that design. can copy it. As far as we are concerned, we don't touch forms for now.  We don't have time to do that. So we don't touch the design of the current forms. So you can just copy past it for that for now.  But we will style the forms.

4:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll copy the form. I'll copy this form and I'll put it into that policy. Into the policy. Is that it?

4:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  Play out?

4:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. And then we can.

5:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  update the text and we can update the sidebar, this right sidebar, with content that's specific to controls. That's more specific to controls and not to policies.  But for now, maybe it's best we do it that way. policies can be edited, but controls won't be editable for now.  So there will be differences between the two, but we can maybe just use the same layout. Just because we already have this implemented just in the ugly way you saw it approved and I deployed a control on the meeting.  By the end of meeting I clicked approve and I click deploy. And you can do it yourself if you want on the link I can send it to you.  And we can just style that and that's it and that should work for now. At least standard controls. I'm talking now about standard controls that don't require any additional flows, any additional like hardware reporting that's specific.  Okay.

5:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just to be like not here. it's like this?

6:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, or less something like that. Yeah, but of course, with the right sidebar, you have to have the right sidebar and stuff like that.  I think that can reduce time, as I said, for both of us, both sides, development and design, and that way we can move forward and maybe have this new way of doing it in the next version.  If you don't think like that, feel free to say I'm up for suggestions and ideas.

6:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's probably very easy to work with. No, it's okay. I see the point in that. I'm just frustrated that we keep getting to the edge of things and then it realizes something and we need to step back.  like she doesn't think about this.

6:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it's not easy. not easy and the thing is we are now balancing also time. Time is our biggest enemy right now because...  trying to release and she also wants to release this in two weeks time or something like that and we are very very limited on resources and time and it's the question of what we can do to just get it out so and she's also being pressured from external sources and so on so I would say I would say we need to find the balance for this same new piece of vision then we can improve on things and also to be honest we are all working really hard on this but we don't have much of the user feedback so I think we'll be a lot smarter once people start using the app and we'll know a bit more of what's crucial for them and not so it's okay it's okay I understand I understand the logic of this step I will communicate to Romeo it's fine I agree yeah I know I know it's interesting you have to stop now in the middle of it and go but maybe this will be quickest you know both for you and me also here on the you have you seen that how so you don't have to this tab at the top you don't have to have it so you see this tab at the top that says deploy  I met all of you on the policies page. that one, yeah, we don't have to have it here because on controls, let me send you the links.  Go to this link. I'll send you on Slack.

8:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where you at? Yes, Sherry, Stan. So I'm seeing what you're seeing.

8:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, hold on, me find you again, okay. So, yeah, go to governance, Stan.

8:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where's the cover?

8:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, yeah, there. Yeah, and now you can, this is live, so you can click any control that's deployed, you can click conflict of interest, yeah, okay.  And this is the page you were talking about just now. So we said that we'll just use policies let out for this page, okay.

8:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, we'll just put the sidebars, yeah.

8:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, sidebars and make it a bit prettier and the header and all that stuff that makes this page look.  better you can go through the approval feel free to approve and deploy it's fine yeah and then deploy yes sure and then yeah pick any date whatever okay no no no no no go back go back close the bug we didn't replace the button just look x now yeah and now this is deployed now if I as an employee would submit a conflict of interest declaration then you would see it in see all requests at the top right corner this top right widget this most recent submissions widget to the right here that one yeah and then click see all requests and here is the table with all all the requests that you would get from all the policies so we could we could have it like this like see all of them and then we can also like policies have we can have it the depth tab at the top we can have both I don't know that's maybe up to us to decide it's fine so just just so you know I don't want to confuse you too much  but this is basically the standard control flow. have it more or less, you know, that's the thing. I will maybe I can do it like this, for example, for lunch, be on that page, I will be an employee now and I'll leave them alone.  There are some missions and I'll fill in the form just to show you how it works. We see Let me show you this.  Yeah, don't think it will allow me to submit anything just because I don't have any business that IPI are working for this, that's fine.  Yeah, it won't allow me to submit. I wanted to show you also their call flow back. we can maybe do that some other day so basically after I submit then you have to go in and approve or rejected dimension but we can go through that later maybe when with a bit of a fresh head so basically uh this was I wanted to show you and and maybe discuss with him maybe be better to go to do this because it will be quicker for you and us and then do your your way of what you try to develop do it as a phase two something like that because in in the long run we don't want all our pages to look the same just with different content it will be confusing to the users and it will be hard to to go through it you x y but that's also probably something you saw yourself yeah mm-hmm yes but from my understanding it's just one screen that romeo has to make right it's two so this one is done already okay this one the one you're looking at it done and that's the ready line we have that design already okay so  I can go to Governance, please, so that we can see the, yeah. So the one that you, the tremendous do is when you click on a view, so when you click that, that's the one that click X, please.

12:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's right.

12:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, then this see all requests page. when you click see all requests, this one, although this one, I'm not sure, actually this one, no, we don't need to present this one because it's pretty, it's a table on a page.  For now it can stay like this as far as we are concerned. So for this one, I mean, he can just have it in there so that it makes sense in the Figma, but it can be copy pasted.  It's table and a page. No, no design here, maybe only copying, pasting it in the Figma just so that we have it, no design required here.  And then the page I want to show you, but I cannot show you, but we need to approve and reject pages for design.  And I can show you that maybe tomorrow when I'm bored now, he's on the backend site. He can help me create a submission so that we have a  so that we see when the employee creates a submission so that we see how it looks like. But the pages I'm talking about will go to Figma now just so you know, just so you get the idea.  And go to iteration one, please. Go to the right of this, completely right of this fault. So right, right.  Yeah, and right. Zoom out. No, no, Zoom out. Yeah, more right. Go back.

13:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That down.

13:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, that one. so this is the pages I'm talking about. And this will also need a bit redesign for but I want to show you how they look like, but I cannot do it now.  I will. So that's it. And then we have a complete standard flow of standard control. More or less, of course, with some minor adjustments, but then the standard controls are done.  And then we can need to design the customer here. But what do we need to do on this one?  Probably just maybe make it a bit prettier with your design language. I'm not sure if it looks if it's if  It's okay. I'm also fine with that. can keep it the same. It's even less work for all of us, but maybe just if we need to maybe polish it a bit.  This part here in the middle, the summary is not like this. Summary is not like this. We just put the read-only version of the form here.  So that's it's a bit, but I would like you to view the live version of it, and then maybe Romeo can take a and see if he wants to change something, some small adjustments just to make it more in line.  Because I think in the newest design, we don't have any more of these white headers. You can see this gives hospitality form header.  So I'm not sure if we need to keep it or not, but these are minor stuff. Just maybe review it, and if it's good, then if it fits in with design, I'm fine with that.  But yeah, for now, for now we can do maybe that form page that just went through policy page, running on the form page, and then tomorrow I can show you maybe the rest of the flow.  And then I would say we got to be covered with the basic control flow for now. And then we can present  to Abby as a flow. So Abby, when you see tears, you click here, you click here, and then we can start work from there and see if we are missing something or she wants something different.  I think that will be the easiest way to maybe do this. And quick and not easiest, quickest, I would say, that's the key.

15:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

15:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  But this is all suggestions. if you have other ideas or suggestions, quickly to mention them and also ping me if you have more questions.  No, let's just get it done.

15:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, let's just get it done. Because the situation I want to avoid is Abby not making decisions and then feeling like design is holding things back.  This is what I don't want to happen. Yeah, I agree. We need to be effective.

15:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  And we can, especially at this stage, the thing is, we are now basically every couple of weeks and we need to release something.  At least that's what she's planning on. We'll see if we can do it. So I would say, let's try to just push this and have this out and then work after it.  some improvements and stuff. I got to run on another meeting as I said if you have any questions just ping me and make sense to me make sense me I feel the channel is open so we can talk no problem yeah definitely thank you and see you bye bye you
