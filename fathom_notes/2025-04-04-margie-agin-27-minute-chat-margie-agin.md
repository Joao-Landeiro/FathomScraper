0:00 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Hi Mark. How are you?

0:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, good, I'm you? Yeah, good.

0:05 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Here I'll hop on video. Give me a sec. Oh, no I am. I'm just really close.

0:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can see you, I can see you. Thank you so much for sending the email and, you know, actually looking for the link because it was a bit of a filtering thing.

0:24 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  It was. It actually was. Yeah, I'm really interested in the topic. So it seems like a, seems like a, you know, good way to meet somebody new from around the world and, and that's done an interesting subject so yeah.  Thank you.

0:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much. Do you mind if I leave the AI recorder on?

0:44 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  That's fine. Yeah, sure. No, perfect.

0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So really quick context. Yeah, I've been doing the workshop thing for a while. And I get a little bit frustrated that sometimes people think about workshops as the.  HR, team building, sometimes cringey things, and really powerful, right, to guide discussions, difficult conversations, decisions, and so on. And I've always been able to find a lot of advice around facilitation, like exercises, the methods and so on.  But I didn't find so much around turning those things into products that are part of a broader offering for services firms.  Yeah, yeah. And I got really intrigued by that, and I wanted to, you know, I've been thinking about it and writing about it for a while, but I never really, you know, put it out in a consistent way.  I have a newsletter, I've seen that you follow it. Thank you. And I was like, let's try to make this a little bit more cohesive.  And so you are part of a very small group of people.

1:57 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yes. Nice.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there's like maybe seven people at most that I've said went through the trouble of doing what you did So I'd really like to know more about what you know, call to you.

2:11 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  What what made you think I want to know more Sure, okay So I can answer that two two different ways because I I have a dual purpose Just a little about me so I've been An independent consultant for about 12 years and I hope and I focus on product marketing for B2B technology companies cyber security is one area that I focus on my My tip book I my best fit client I would say is someone that's like a they got series B funding You know, they're still kind of scrappy But now they've got some money they want to put their foot on the gas they've tried a lot of different things now  have some clients under their belt, they have some products under their belt and they're starting to grow. So one of the things, and this is for my personal business, that I will focus on with them is I often find that they've made a lot of assumptions, they've learned a lot of things, but they haven't aligned well on them because everybody is so busy and running around and you have the founder hearing one story and thinking one thing, you have a sales head, thinking another, they just brought in a head of marketing and they're thinking something else, and then you have people that are like their professional services or their sales engineers that are on the ground working with customers have all kinds of knowledge.  All this align a lot of those different kinds of stories and Also, I talk with their customers and I bring that together to basically help them, all this to say, what we're trying to do is refine their messaging, right?  Figure out what's working, make it more crisp, and usually we do that as an internal exercise and then that becomes their new sales deck, their new website, you know, the way they present themselves to the world as sort of the, you know, the next evolution of their company.  Okay, so that's the outcome of all of this work.  And what I am, so I will do, we will loosely call them workshops, okay, but I will do lots of different exercises to try to align these people and I know I could be better on it, okay, because I will be honest and say I will try to get them
  POSITIVE REACTION: Margie discusses challenges getting workshop participants to share their knowledge - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/8z49za2xyE8FagcxQDTTMaW2WcGqV33j?timestamp=300.0
    to the table. Sometimes they don't want to come to the table. They're very busy, right? Sometimes their attitude is, this is, you know, I already know all of this, but you haven't shared it with anybody else, right?

    So I need you to come to the table, right?
  So, and then I want to really, I want to uncover all the dirt in these sessions because all the dirt, all the dirt, people disagree with each other.  We want that on the table, right? And I'm finding sometimes I think things are going really well, but in fact, then we go back and we try to do the next stage of work and I'm finding, oh, we actually aren't aligned at all, right?  So I will be honest with you and tell you, I know I could be better at that part. And, you know, as many times as I've tried to do workshop prep, know, do follow-ups of the workshops, I still feel like there's  skills and there's techniques that I was actively searching for to improve my own, my outcomes.

6:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is really very much ICP stuff. Like you are exactly the kind of person I want to be talking to right now.

6:20 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yeah, so but I'm an independent person. I've done this for 12 years, but I've never had employees. So as I've grown, I partner with lots of different people and I will have different experts or different people that I will work with, but I'm a one woman shop.  So I am also very much trying to create some repeatable processes for myself or if I bring somebody else in, instead of trying to sort of recreate the wheel every time.  Can you go back 10 seconds? Yeah, I was just saying I want to create some more repeatable processes. for myself.  But my thing is I will maybe only work with like four clients at a time, right? And maybe only one of them does a workshop at the beginning of the project.  So I may be only running, you know, six of these workshops a year. I don't have that much under my belt that I'm like, so I'm refining it, but I don't do it all the time.  So I still feel like every time I do this, I'm kind of creating something a little bit new. Got it, got it.  So that's me, that's my own personal. I was interested in reading the book and just listening and learning, know, I'm just trying to pick up the knowledge that I can, right?  And I wish there was like an affordable course for someone like me to learn because I'm not, you know, I'm not a company.  I'm just I'm a son who needs this for my business. That's that's my first goal. My second Second thing I was thinking is right now.

8:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have a client that is a services company Okay So my point is he's a new kind of client the way you frame it it sounds like there's something different about them Yes, because I usually work with product companies.

8:22 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, and also I would just say this client is like They're not they were a They came together as a merger of seven different small services organizations.  Okay, you can imagine And they've been working I've been working with them for a few months they've been working for a couple of years to set up Structure and processes and you know kind of bring everybody together under one umbrella  But basically they had a bunch of different their systems integrators Okay, and advisors and consultants that that help people that work in an industry called maintenance and operations Okay, okay, so and they they themselves do a lot of workshops.  All right so as a Oh I think my connection So I'm so sorry Video and see if that helps.  Okay. Okay. Let's come coming from a product marketing perspective You know helping them each new each new clients build their business, you know clarify what they do.  I'm realizing that they They're very inconsistent, right and how they it's like, oh, we're really smart people, you know We'll help you what do you need and and so I've been thinking about how to product ties their services and one of  services is workshops, right? Value assessment workshops, you know, ROI workshops. And as I'm thinking about this, I'm just thinking, wow, this is actually the same thing I'm trying to do in my own little business.  But here we have this big company with a lot of really like, you know, industry experts that need to need to sort of package and productize what they're doing, so we can more effectively sell it.  And so that's, that was all that is like why I was, wow, this is interesting. Here's somebody that spent a lot of time thinking about this.  I, you know, I want to learn. This was a great, great introduction.

10:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for that. I felt from your tone that maybe you were like, oh, I went on a bit of a tangent.

10:51 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  You did not. was really interesting.

10:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  First question, are you familiar with the book productize from Isha Armstrong?

11:01 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  So, I have heard of it. I have not read it. Okay, it's really good. So, it's not really about workshops.

11:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's more about this more strategic shift from services to products. But if you are, you know, noodling on this, I think you might appreciate it.  My ratio of, you know, highlights and, you know, little stickers and post-it notes is huge on that one. So, Okay, there's a few things here.  So, first, it told me a little bit about your context, which is quite similar to mine, I think in some ways.  I'm also an independent consultant. I don't do product marketing, but all of these dynamics of you arrive to solve one sort of thing, but then you realize there's other things that need to be addressed.  And Alignment is a big one. think Alignment is forever. It's an evergreen problem. And then you start to think like maybe there's more stuff I can do around workshops.  From your profile and from what you told me, I would assume, and please correct me, we work with a lot of, you know, really clever but sometimes too clever by half people, like very smart but not used to seeing their own blind spots.

12:27 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yes.

12:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I also meet them often. I think there's a way of saying this without coming across as a bit.

12:38 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  No. I think maybe we are a little bit like that as well. I mean, I see it in myself.  I'm trying to, it's not what I do and it's very hard to do it for yourself no matter who you are because you get so tied up in the details and you these people are very smart and a lot of them are.  If you've ever met like someone who's an expert in cyber security, honestly, So I've been able to break down a lot of those barriers, honestly, because I've been doing this a long time, but it's still very hard to get all these people in the room.  Some people don't want to participate. Some people, you know, take up all the space, the air, I was thinking about it in terms of like, facilitation skills, like you were saying.  But I think it's more than that.

13:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it's, in my understanding, it's a little bit of a web of skills. Definitely, I think facilitation skills, I think they are like alignment problems.  They are evergreen valuable skills to have for any job, really. to be honest, I think my strong suit is not necessarily facilitation itself.  mean, yes, I can do it, but it's more about the design planning of the experience. when you start, I think this is common with any field of expertise, from when you begin at the surface level, everything seems like kind of the same.  But then you go deep and you realize, oh, like there's different ways of looking at it. At this, like, there's different kinds of facilitators.  There's different kinds of workshops. And within those, there's different kinds.

14:21 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yeah.

14:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, I agree that facilitation skills are interesting skills to have. So when I start looking outside the frames, because I'm thinking, and I've also made some notes.  So the first thing is I think you're exactly the kind of person I want to be talking to. So I'm very, very happy that we got to talking.  And I'm very happy that you are motivated to do this, because, I mean, you have genuine curiosity. And you've been.  for working with this problem or coexisting with these challenges for a bit. So this is really good for me.  I really appreciate it. So here's what I'm thinking about regarding the book. So I've read that book, The Right Useful Books.  I really like it. If you think about writing a book, that's another one I recommend. And one of the things that the book suggested that I think was really smart was that the book is a product.  And what we know about products today is that you need a lot of iterations to make them really good, right?  In a world where people have a lot of choice, a lot of options, to stand out, you really have to be the best option and to be the best useful book, you need to test it with people and see if the book is actually helping you.  So the book recommends two kinds of conversations that I should be having. Really, you know, hone it in. There's the learning kind of conversations, mostly around...  You and I, we could have both. We would just need to... um signpost and you know like oh now we're having this kind of conversation and now we're having this kind of conversation and sometimes diffuse a bit but so one kind of conversation is a learning conversation where I ask you how you do your things and how you apply workshops uh what's your context in which situations you use these kind of things so it's very much a me listening a lot more and then there's another kind of conversation which is me practicing the act of explaining these things right it's more much more me uh you know teaching you what I know about this and so there's there's these two kinds of conversations unlike the conversation we are having right now started as a learning conversation me learning from your context and so on and so I'll I'll love if you could find a way of with some structure to have more of this so  If you're open to it, I love it. I really appreciate it. And I think, in a sense, these two things feed into each other.  I learn from you and I try to pay back by teaching you what I know. So, I mean, this is not a weird way of me trying to sell your book.  It's actually just paying you back for the insight that you give me. Is this roughly something you would be curious about?

17:28 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Definitely. I can really appreciate the thought that you are putting into thinking of your book like a product and iterating on it.  I wrote a book six years ago that was self-published. I'll send you the link. But, you know, I wrote the book based on my experience.  I did test, like, I had several beta readers after it was already written, but then I just pulled the trigger and went for it.  And as I think about where I am in my business and the things I think about now, it's six years later, and I'm glad I did it, but I think I probably would have done it a little bit differently, or if I did it again, I might do it differently.  I'm impressed that you're going through all of these really thoughtful steps to do that, honestly. I hope I speak to It's not a small thing.  They're by a book, and I think I underestimated that. If I may be, I'm also underestimating it a little bit.  But anyway, no, mean, honestly, I think this could be really, like, mutually beneficial, because I really do like to just share the different kinds of experiences that I've had, and I am definitely  eager to learn and think about, you know, the things that you would recommend, I could put into use in a very practical way.  And I think it would help me a lot. Oh, that's wonderful to hear.

19:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm really, really happy. So, okay, so directionally we are aligned. Here's what I'm thinking. To me, it makes the most sense if we have a clear, a kind of expectation in terms of how many conversations we have, just to keep it to use your word, Chris, I like that word.  Because sometimes these things start on a high note and then life gets in the way in three months later, like, oh, it's been a while since we spoke, and we kind of lose the momentum.  And I think for you as somebody learning that kind of thing, it's also not amazing to just eventually get distracted by something else, or me getting this  And for me, I think I would lose a bit of the crispness of the insight, right? So not to make this too square, but I would love if we could, like, oh, let's start with, I don't know, maybe four conversations, and then we really try to use them as well as we can.  And I'm always open to having more, just, you know, having these sprints. Is this something that makes sense?

20:28 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yeah, that makes sense. Sure.

20:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. OK, so in that sense, I would think about us scheduling maybe four conversations, or roughly one hour each.  And I would maybe, how do you say, one learning, do you say, intercollate? that the word? Intercollate?

20:54 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Interspersed, maybe. Interspersed? Yeah. OK, nice. Thank you. I'll use it. So interspersed.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  learning me learning from you and teaching like me explaining something that would be useful to you and maybe once a week or something like that we can of course schedule them ideally not have them too distant but I don't want to be peeking about it I mean where are you in Brazil I'm in Brazil yes okay okay sometimes I'm in Portugal I am Portuguese I'm from Portugal and around June I'll spend June a little bit of July in Portugal okay where are you I think I'm outside of Washington DC he's okay is that roughly in New York time yes same okay so that's one hour you what I am one hour ahead of you when I'm in Brazil I think four hours four hours in Portugal when I'm okay that can work but but yeah so I'd love to do this and I've been practicing okay they put this thing in it's little bit  collaboration proposal.

22:02 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  No strings attached.

22:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  not about that. Just to feel also for myself, putting a weight into it. Yeah, it makes it a little more official.

22:16 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yeah, official is a good word. It makes sense. Let's start with four. That seems doable. Yeah, I'm in. Sure.  Nice.

22:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we still have one minute or two. Well, I do have more, but just I would love to, you know, finish this conversation already, you giving you something of value.  Are there any specific things that you're more, you know, curious that maybe I can give you some pointers? Oh my gosh.

22:50 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  This was a bit of an unfair question.

22:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  sorry.

22:54 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  And maybe this is something for our next conversation, but maybe we won't get there. And I'm going to do, I wouldn't even call it a workshop yet.  Like, workshop sounds like it's a much bigger thing. I'm gonna do a pre, a prep, let's put it that way.  A prep for a larger workshop, because it's only gonna involve three people and I work with them all the time anyway, okay?  But we're going to be working on developing a value proposition for this company. This is actually the same company that I was talking about before, okay?  And I have a value proposition canvas, right? That we want to fill in. And now I'm gonna ask you this question.  This is kind of a broad question, but here's something that I've been thinking about going into this. I, because I've been working with this company for three or four months already, I'm not, I have, I actually have a lot of thoughts.  If you gave me a day, know, a half a day, I could fill this thing in based on what I already know, okay?  presented to them. Let's say what do you think? The other extreme is I walk them through it as if we have just met.  And I have a number of questions to guide someone through this and I make them fill it in. So I'm curious with your thoughts on how much to how much to share.  it's like I already know the answer to the test, the quiz, right? But I actually don't want to give them the answer because I want them to feel ownership.  I want them to feel buy-in. I want them to feel excitement about it. And I'm trying, I'm going to tell you straight, I'm trying to fight against myself because I feel like I could just move faster if I just did it myself.  Okay. But I actually feel like that's the wrong, it's not about proving how smart I am, I want them to feel the ownership, okay?  So I'm just curious, is that something that you hear from people or that you feel like is something you've even encountered?  And the second part of that is like, do you have any kind of a recommendation? This is obviously very like a broad question.  know, would you start by filling some things in as examples or am I feeding them too much? Should I make them do the work?  And my purpose to facilitate.

25:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is a bunch of really good questions. I've also felt If we can't cover it in this time, that's okay with me.

25:43 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  if you want- No, no, it's okay.

25:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like this because that speaks to me as well. I mean, I've struggled with this and still struggle from time to time.  This sense of also because you are an expert, you have this pattern recognition, you know where they need to get.  And also maybe they are presenting as inpatients are like you're impatient. Let's move faster. So I'll tell you what to do, right?  So I think that's a common thing. a couple things that First thing, how much time are you thinking about for this fellow proposition campus exercise?

26:17 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  So what I was thinking is that I would first do this with there's the the chief marketing officer And there's another product marketing lead.  Okay. So I was thinking that I would show them this Start it walk through it get them comfortable with it and then and maybe an hour hour and a half Okay, like a taste a taste of it.  Okay, and then if they are like, okay This is an interesting process, but there's a lot of unknowns. We need to expand it I need to bring in a head of sales.  Okay, I want I want some other people in the room from other departments But what I was thinking was I would do it almost like a safe space with a small group first so that they are  comfortable with it and then we all the marketing team is comfortable with it and then take it to the larger group.

27:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so a couple of thoughts, I think 90 minutes is probably appropriate, depends a little bit on how people participate, but I think it's a good chunk of time to get buying for people that they don't want to waste too much time.  I would have different files when you do with different teams, so first you do perhaps with the marketing team and they don't see what the sales team has done and later you bring these things together, for instance, oh the marketing team they have the blue post-its and the sales team they have the pink post-its and then you bring them this together.  There's an aspect around conflict mediation, oh we guys think this is , you know. an aspect around that, but I think you can in the asynchronous moment where we bring all the things into one canvas, I think you can probably fine tune this a little bit to rephrase things that could generate a lot of conflict.  So that's something. In terms of, you know, tamping down on that desire to, you know, to just go straight ahead and tell them what it is, I think you have the right thinking, which is if I do that, I don't get what I need out of it.  This is not an intellectual exercise. It's a political and social exercise, an alignment exercise. So it is difficult. I think I have the right thinking on it.  would just, like I do this sometimes, I write something on a post and I stick it to my computer next to the camera just to, you are not like to myself, you're not the genius, you're just helping them get to the conclusion.  And oftentimes it's, even if you've seen this a lot of times, know what's the 100% solution, but to get to the 100% solution you would lose them in terms of like the buying, it is not worth it.  It's much better if they get to a 60% solution, but they kind of agree on it, right? Very recently I was facing this dilemma, it was, you know, eating, eating me inside, because I could see some like failure modes and anti-patterns in that client.  I was like, it's not the way you do it, but Ed tries to, you know, approach this subject, maybe I can do better, but at the end of the day they were not at the point that they would be, you know, open to me telling them, I thought, this is way you should do it, right?  They were not at that stage. And it's unfortunate, I think, that we'll never know if my advice was right or if I was just, you know, too presumptuous.  But I think that gets easier with practice, but definitely you're not alone. that and the very practical way I try to deal with this is like physically in the environment, like the mentors and like stay the course is not about you is about them.  The buying is more valuable than you coming across as very clever. think that's Yeah, that's helpful.

30:19 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  It's good to know I'm not alone in that.

30:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, and I think I think people that are attracted to the workshop thing. They tend to have some commonalities like they are systems thinkers, but they also like to work with people and they're very curious.  Usually they love the tools. So there are different kinds of facilitators for sure. But there are traits we tend to have in common.  And I think that's a very usual thing. In terms of handling difficult participants, sometimes participants can be difficult in different ways.  All unhappy families are unhappy in their own way. like one that's very good to deal with people that are very eager to participate but very they talk about the wrong things is just give them a role you know Mark Mark is very technical and Mark is really worried that people don't understand the intricacies of zero trust you know authentication whatever but the conversation that is happening it's not about zero trust authentication did you say because you know the kind of stuff I do or did you just say that I I worked at steps I think my wife works in corporate compliance one of my major clients that is literally what they do the company called delimia they do zero trust authentication I don't know what it is I was like that's very specific okay so I say that mark is really like oh you guys don't understand this requires a complete reward  of our infrastructure. You don't get it, you don't get it, you don't get it. And I think there's a few ways of, you know, addressing this kind of pattern.  One is to first give them a little bit of space, because oftentimes you will feel that others are not listening and if they don't feel listened to, they will just keep on repeating.  You give them a little bit of space, but you kind of time box this space, even if just for yourself, I'm going to give like five minutes to Mark.  You appreciate the input and then you give them something to do during the workshop. Hey, Mark, could you help me?  I don't know. This was a classic, this is a classic for live workshops, virtual workshops a little bit different, but taking notes or keeping us on track on time or just give them something to, know, feel relevant.  That's like every elementary school teacher's time.

32:51 - Margie Agin (Margie Agin)
  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

32:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if you have, yeah, yeah, for sure. And if you have team, which is people that don't participate, they're like, you know, they're thinking deeply about this, but they're not coming forward, right?  The way to increase their participation is, is both, you know, handling the marks that people don't talk too much, also shaping the workshop in a way that we're not just incentivizing wit and quick thinking.  So if you create moments where people can have like five minutes, everyone, and they write things on their own, and then later they show what they have.  People call this the together alone. We are working alone in a group. This gives more opportunity to the more introverted people.  I think it probably, because of your comment around elementary school, I think you have experienced with this sort of thing.
