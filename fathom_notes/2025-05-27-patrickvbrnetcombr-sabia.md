0:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How are you?

0:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, good. And you? Good.

0:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Are you still living in Brazil or Portugal? I'm in Brazil.

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In two weeks, I'll be going to Portugal to spend two months. Wow.

0:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah.

0:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And...

0:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Are you going for work?

0:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, we're trying to spend more time there. So we're splitting. It's not 50-50, but... Like a third, maybe. This year, I think this year was a little bit more than usual.

0:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And what's in Portugal? My family, and I'm now an uncle.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we're trying to spend more time there. Yeah. And she's growing really fast. So that's it. And also... You know, Portugal,  I like Brazil, but also Portugal has other things that we both like, my wife and I, so it's good to have access to both worlds.  Amazing. Thank you. Thank you for sharing.

1:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And just one more question, because I just want for curiosity to know how things are going with the Exotic Matter podcast and life with you.

1:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the podcast, it was a lot of work, and I think it was also a lot of work because I wanted to do it in a very João kind of way.  Like, I've coded the website with AI, of course, but still takes a lot of time. I don't know if you've played around with AI coding tools.  I know. It takes time. It takes time. It takes time. So, but I'm very glad that I did it.  Now it's... Out, every episode is recorded. I'll just, you know, putting them out every week. And I can hear you.  Something to show that is public. I stopped. Oh. What? Can you... What? Um... Um... Um... Um... You I don't know.  I am ready, yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay, now I hear you, yes. So you were telling me? Yeah, so the good thing about the podcast is that there's a thing that is done and that I can send people and is public, right?  Sometimes we get all of these creative projects that they are kind of internal. You spend a lot of time on it, but there's nothing that you can show to the outside world.  And the podcast is a public thing. I can send a link to it. It's up there, so that's good.  Because I usually start things that they stay on my computer or stuff like that, so it's good that it's up there.  And now I need to distribute it more. I've noticed that I put a lot of energy into creating things.  I put less energy into distributing those things, right? And that's something I'm aware of, and I'm still trying to find ways of doing that consistently, which is difficult.

4:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, I was thinking, you know, like, in my own business, you know, to have a business, most of the time, like, I'm a solopreneur, and it takes, you know, putting your attention in the marketing, in the branding, in the advertising, in the delivery system, you know.  You need to have a lot of eyes, you know, and it's like, like life, you know. There are things that you, that they need maintenance, but there's no, like, you do a task and that is done.  No, you need to maintain it, you know, like the relationship. It's something that you need to maintain every day, every day, every day, every day.  So, like, what happens to me, it's something I lose focus. I put more attention in creation and delivering, but not so much in distributing or, like, expanding the message, you know.  So, yeah. Yeah. I think it's just part of the process of entrepreneurship. Yeah, yeah.

5:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree. I agree. I haven't yet figured it out 100%. But also I think that that's probably something I will always feel more comfortable with creation than distribution.  So I don't think there's a future João that is just amazing at distribution, as good as he is at creation.  I think I'm better at creation and that's it. So I just need to keep it within interesting bounds. But this was a good start of the conversation.  I have some... Come again? A quick check-in. A quick check-in, yeah. No, I appreciate you doing that because I sometimes jump too quickly.  And so I have some things to show you. And I also have some questions for you to see, like, how we proceed on this.  that's... This... Um... This... Let me share my screen with you. Should I send you the link for the Miro?  Maybe that's a good thing, right?

6:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If you want, yes, or I can look at your screen for now.

6:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I took the branding document you sent me. I extracted things from it to make sure I could use it here.  And let me show you what I have. Okay. So basically, I will go over it in more detail. But basically, the same kind of structure we spoke about, which is like for this version, let's try to keep it in a way that iteration, it's easier.  So if something changes, you need to break the whole thing apart. And keep it, there's kind of a grid system, which is somewhat similar to the branding guide.  let's it started. Cool. And then there's some exercises, which are basically the same exercise you had, and some changes in some of them.  Not all of them have changed, okay? And I've tried to put some things in Spanish, but I mean, for this version, it is like the first draft.  I'm sure there's a lot of mistakes, okay? Okay, so we always start with the cover. That's important for also the thumbnails.  I've tried to use your iconography on this, and I think there's opportunities for that, not just in the visual, but also in the activities, and I'll show you an example of this.  There's an agenda. This will have text. And we try to use different backgrounds just to bring out the tension, but usually the more active ones are the orange ones, right?

8:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  For the energetic exercise, or not energetic, just the dynamic exercise, right? The orange one.

8:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. But it's not always like that. If there's a shift in the exercise, like, oh, we've been doing this thing, and now we need to shift your attention, in the middle, there's something that changes color, you know?  But we can touch on it. So, one of the questions I have for you is, the easiest thing for you to update as somebody that will run the workshop is just to put a post-it note with the participant's name.  That's very easy, right? Or even for themselves. Now, if you want to make this a little bit more tight, what you could do is to get their pictures from LinkedIn or something, and put them here, and then we wouldn't have this thing.  We just have their picture, and then they answer here.

8:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like that.

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I could hear the activity because I noticed that you did it with four people. I've made it so that, you know, there's six, and if you have six, you need to have this collage in this way.  And there's a reason why I always keep the widescreen thing, which is it's easy for people to zoom in and make sure that they're not missing anything.  So I never use or I very rarely use slides that are not like screen proportions. And we give them some space, and each person has a little space for it.  And if there are six, we have these two as well. Now here, there's a change in activity. I mean, it's the same question, but I just risk it to make a suggestion here, which is when you ask about the intention.  And I took a look at the main answers that people gave. And it seemed to me that They were related to these things, okay?  And this is also easy to change. But the idea was to not just keep asking them to put things on a post-it, they can write it and place it on these things, right?  None of these things are bad or negative, so it doesn't mean that the top right is the good one.  It's just that there's different approaches. How do you feel about this? I like it.

10:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's helpful to have a visual understanding of their intention. But when we ask about the intention, is this related to the outcomes also of the experience?  You know, because, like, you know, it's how they align the intention. know, like, when you ask qualifier. Intensión, what was your intention, right?  The intention is going to be wrote there in the participant's name, or how do you know their intention and then how that intention aligns to one of those outcomes, right?  Because at the end it's connection with themselves or freedom, like on block or something, you know, like, you know, I don't, I maybe, this can have aligned intention with an outcome, and they will say, you know, like, this helped me, I don't know.  So what do you, what were you trying to do with this one?

11:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it. So with this one is, let's role play this, right? Let's say that this is my name.  So I arrive at this, at this exercise, and I see my name. Here. And I agree with you. I see your point.  We need to make people write their intentions, right? I agree. I agree. So maybe what we can do is shift this into this intention.  Something like this. Maybe it can be a bit more finessed, but I get here. I know. Okay. So I need to write my intention here.  And I write it. I wanted to break free of my limiting beliefs. I don't know. Something like this. Right.  And Because each one has a different color, I know that the green one is mine. Or, maybe that's even better, we just put it down here as a legend, like the name, and we just put the squares here with the same color.  Yes, I think that's... Got it. That will be better.

13:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes.

13:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, bring them here. Okay, I'll just make a note here to correct this. Okay. So, what would happen is that I drag the intention here, right?  I think you've asked another question. I think you've asked two questions. So, the first one was just like, how does it work, the activity?  And I think you've also asked, like... What intention are we talking about? Is that right?

14:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Okay.

14:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So from my understanding in the activity on Mural, when you asked that what was your intention, it was the intention with the experience that they had, they are now integrating, right?  Yes.

14:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

14:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe we can, sorry, rewrite that? Okay, right. Question to refer to.

14:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because I was thinking, you know, like, at the four corners, you know, like, there are four hidden motives why people come to it.  So maybe they can. The intention put it in one of those four. So then we talk about how that happened.  That is, the four things, it's change the mind state, insights, new perspectives, and emotional processes, right? These are like the hidden motivations that people come.  So if we have like the four corners, that kind of things, change the mind state, insight, new perspective, and emotional processing, if they, you know, the exercise is, you know, like put it like whatever you feel like the intention with the experience, it's more aligned.  And then we open the space so they can talk about how that happened, you know, and we can subtract that emotional story or narrative that they experience during the process, right?  Something like that.

15:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that. I think I'm also thinking that based on this, because the person went through an experience, right?  And some, correct me if I'm wrong, sometime has passed, and now they're integrating the experience, right? This is the integration.

16:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We want to know how much was the dose, and they did the experience. This is like an integration circle.  It doesn't matter if it was in a retreat or alone. We want to know the dose, the intention, and what happened, so we can have the substrate, right insights.

16:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that maybe we need a slide here. It's not just really an agenda. The image that comes to me, it's like when you're taking a flight and the air hostess says, oh, this is what's going to happen.  Right now, when people are going through this workshop, I understand that they are not having a psychedelic experience. They're past it.  But it's useful in my mind to say, look, we are now going to look at the things you've been through and we want to extract what's going to happen.  So it's more about the intention of this meeting. The agenda is more about the structure of the activities and so on.  But it feels to me that there's a slide here about intention of this meeting.

17:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, there should be like an intention and a purpose, know, so maybe the agenda we know. Have you heard about Chaos Pilot, I do art?  You know, like what's the intention? What are we going to do? What are the expected outcomes? What is my role?  Maybe something like that.

17:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. it. Okay. And now, on this activity, remember that we spoke about people doing the collage, also selecting things for their collage, right?  And my suggestion was to split it into moments. So my suggestion here is that. So they do the collage, right?  The collage is kind of fresh. Actually, well, anyway, they do the collage, the collage is kind of fresh, and then we bring them back, we make zoom out from the experience, and we ask them, what was your intention with this experience?  And they give us some answers here, right? And then, we invite them to go back to the collage and mark with dots.  They don't need to use all the dots. Some aspects of the collage that are more striking to them, right?  And here, this is, I want your feedback on this, which is all of these things are kind of... Stickers.  Okay. They're nice.

19:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like it.

19:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're stickers. And I know they have different meanings, right? Here's a question. Here's a crossroads I'm at. We can either explain to people what these things mean.  And I know one is idea, the other is wisdom, selflessness. Selfless, you know, growth, so on. Or we can just, you know, let them see the visual and place it in whichever way they want.

19:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think we can just let them put the sticker. So we don't want to explain so much. I think it's better just, you know, like just use the stickers and and connect.  Or because I'm thinking how much time would that take? And we want to keep them engaged. So I agree with you.

20:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that if we try to explain the meaning of each sticker, we created a certain pressure on their minds to do the right thing.  But it's kind of a new image for them. they're like, oh, is this growth? Or is this, oh, I don't know.  And they keep going back and forth and just, I think, takes away from the fluidity. So I like the idea that we don't explain them.  We just give them like, yeah, which one's the only one. And I think also it's probably better to make it a little bit more disorganized, you know, to just give a feeling of, yeah.  I'll make a note here. Thank you. Okay, so let's say I'm participating in this, you asked me to make a collage with what I did, I put some pictures here, and then you bring me back and you say, what was my intention with that experience that I went through?  I placed that experience here on this thing. I think there's some time, and you, as a facilitator, you have flexibility here, you have some time to explore or not, depending on how the flow is going, how people are participating, right?  And then you say, okay, but now let's go back to the collages, and I would love to know, maybe this language is interesting to use, because it frames it not, as something they can do right or wrong, it's just, I'd love to know if there's any of these little pictograms, or icons, that you feel that associates with one of your...  And this also generates, as a facilitator, generates another hook that you can explore or not, in terms of why did you do that, what about this image speaks to you, was it difficult, was it hard, you know, were you undecided?

22:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Talk to me about why you decided on those images, know, like, we can explore with that. Yeah, exactly, exactly.

22:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's, we create an opportunity for having that conversation, precisely. Okay, and then we were shifting a little bit of the color, and I think there's probably something we can do about the flow here, okay, because I think there's, the flow is still not perfect.  Because this question, the fifth activity, is very much related to the third activity, in a sense. Once is more about the beginning, the other one is more about the end, right?  I did it because of that, and after it, I got this stuff, right? So here's my dilemma. In a future workshop, or future iteration, maybe these things are, they take place on the same board, right?  And I can see how we could make it like, what did you want? What did you face? And later, what was an obstacle, right?  That's, those things are very easy to put in a line. So my question. Which means, should we try to put them all in one board?  Because if we try to put it in one board, I think we need boards for each participant. What I don't like about having boards for each participant is that then people get on their own thing and doing their own boards, and it's less about everyone seeing what's happening together.  I don't know if I was very clear in the way I phrased this.

24:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, and I understand, but I think if we put them all together, I think they're not going to flow just with one question.  think when we ask two, three questions in one exercise, they don't really get deep in just one, because they're trying to think this or this or this.  You know, so. So. So. So. So. So. Maybe not just in one and maybe not having like a big board for each one, but just different sections, but like sequentially, maybe.

25:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so I think I understand what you mean. But so like the way we're doing now?

25:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think yes, because for now it seems like we just move to the next question, you know, like and I see each canvas or each slide as a petri dish.  You know, like we want to make an observation here and then an observation here and then an observation here.  So now at the end, maybe one exercise, you know, like now it's time to identify the patterns, you know, like it's about the events that you saw or the feelings that you discover.  It's about what's the connection behind all of this, you know, in a way. So each exercise, it's, you know, like opening doors of understanding and then.  With the pattern is, you know, like, what's the real integration here, you know? At the beginning, they are like, it's like kind of zooming in, and eventually we're zooming out, zooming out, zooming out, zooming out, zooming out, zooming out, and like, okay, this is what we got.  This is what we need to integrate, you know? Okay, okay.

26:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So...

26:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's try to see each slide as a mental framework to observe a feeling, a discovery they had, it's a lens, and how we want to see, you know, we want to make different observations, maybe the same thing, the same thing is a psychedelic experience, but different frames, to see that, it's the different slides.  So, each one needs to be sequential in a way, but also like... It needs to show another angle.

27:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Okay. Let me just make a note for that. Because I have a question for that at the end.  Okay. You should try a microdose while doing this. I haven't tried yet. I should. I'm sure I will at some point.  So, and here is like my attempt at breaking the pattern in like, is this all, right? And we shift.  And also we're changing the colors of the post-its because it makes it easier to give instructions to people like, oh, which post-it?  Oh, the black one. There's no other black one post-its here, right? Which post-it are the red ones? So that's a way of, you know, making them feel.  So now this question is connecting both the intention and the discovery, right? You enter this thing, you discover these things, and you see a connection in there that was preventing you from, you know, getting to where you wanted to get.  This one is just a placeholder. And now this activity is a little bit different from what you suggested. Because what you suggested initially was for people to write three.  And based on those, I've put some here that I suggest that people can just either delete or bring to the outside, you know?  I'm like 80% sure of this, but I'm not 100% sure of this. So I'd love to have your input on this.

29:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, maybe I could base the words that we pick more aligned to the spiritual virtues of Buddhism, that it's courage, confidence, patience, wisdom.  I like that, but maybe we can leave that for now, like that, but I like that we pick just six, you know, like what are, in my experience, like the main, most important values that people discover through this experience, so they visually, they can decide which one they want to work first, you know, like in a way we also want to develop their spirituality and their personal growth.  And, you know, like choosing virtues or these values and keeping them simple for them to just pick one, I think that will make it more intuitive to keep going.

30:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, now that you say that, I think maybe we can make this activity even more interesting. So if everyone has the same, it could be this or could be this, could be others.  If everyone has the same, we could have them like around the circle or something, and people drag their names closer to it, right?  So then you could see more easily if more people are desiring of a thing, if they're more, you know, I can prototype it really quickly.  I think you understand what I mean. Like there's this thing, there's this thing, and this guy says, oh, I want to be here.  And this guy says, oh, I want to be here, you know? Maybe this is what I need in my life.

30:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If I'm very reactive and frustrated with my life, it's because I understood that.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now, this one, I've made this different design because it's supposed to be like heavier, so to say. Of course, you can read faster than I can.  And the thing is, I'm getting a little bit tired of this format. You know, it's a format that works for asking people questions, and we change the colors and the questions.  But at some point, this feels a little bit repetitive. So what format do you suggest? My thing is, when I say format, I mean like the layout, So my challenge here is, I want it to be familiar, so they look and immediately they recognize what they need to do.  We don't need to explain too much. say strategical. We have to go. You

33:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like, a visual? Something like it explains without saying something?

33:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, like, for instance, if the person, if a participant arrives at this slide, it's the only interactive web slide.  Now, there's another one there, but it's very striking in that sense. But the way the activity works is similar to others that they have done, right?  Now, this way of putting the six participants together is very efficient, let's say. Like, the density is well used, and it gives them more space to put things in.  But maybe one thing we could do, one thing we could do just to make this slide a little bit more different.  recognized. Um... Yeah. and So is this, we will make it smaller, okay, and we will make it like this, like this, like this, like this, this.  It's still six, but it's a different perspective, okay. Do you have strong opinions on this?

34:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think the other one, the first one is too narrow, I know they can zoom in, zoom out, but the second one I think it feels a little bit more open for them to, it just feels a more open space, right, like that, square instead of the rectangle.  Thank you. Thank you. you. you. you. Yeah, I prefer this one.

35:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Now, on this activity, the next one, I've tried to make it similar to that prioritization matrix, and I think we need to repeat the same lessons from the first time we've used this thing, which is put a legend.  And people can say, oh, I will do X, Z, Z, Z, Z. And I think, I believe that as they have these ideas, actually, we should break this down into bits.  Right? First, we ask them what they will do, and then we ask them to place it on the matrix.  How do you feel about that?

36:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like it. And also to start the thing that I will do.

36:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Break into two parts.

36:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Start every post-it.

36:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I will. Okay. Okay. So towards the end, I'll break this into parts. Towards the end. What I wanted is to have, like, of all of the slides, I wanted to have a...  Hi, that they could screenshot or save to their computer that has two things. That question that you've asked before, and I've noticed that in the feedbacks of the activity, people said that it was nice that we did it with other people, right?  So I figured maybe an activity where we incentivize this connection, it's a good idea. So I figured that maybe we could make, like, my commitments and also my offer for help.

37:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like that. And I'm thinking about the matrix, the other matrix, you know, once I will do, it's also like, do you think it's a commitment and the other one is a commitment too, but this one, it's more a commitment of what they need to do too.  So, I'm just thinking about, you know, like how can we make it, you know, what about our commitment? So maybe we need to change the other question or maybe it's after I'm thinking.  Okay, excellent point, excellent point.

38:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's think about this, thinking out loud. The intention of the last slide is to be the one that people leave this conversation with a lot of clarity, right?  Okay. So I think there's, okay, so I think there's three things we should do on this last slide. The first one, even if it is small, I think we should put, because we are assuming that the last slide is the only PDF they'll have, like, or the only screenshot.  They could have everything, but there's one that they'll pay more attention to, right? So if that, if that, if that is true, the last slide should.  They contain, even if very small, the structure of the entire encounter. So in a few weeks from now, a few months from now, they find this PDF in their download folder on their PDF.  They can see, oh yeah, I went through this, it was this amount of time, we had this exercise, we did it with Jorge, you know?  So it's like a self-contained thing. That proves that they did a good thing, they did a smart thing, right?  So that's one thing, one suggestion, right? Include description of what happened. Okay. The other thing that I'm thinking that maybe we could do is we ask them, because since all the post-its are different colors, right?  Okay. Okay. We asked them to go back, copy them, and paste them here, right? We copied just the post-its.  So what we'll have is you do an exercise, you get to an answer. do an exercise, you get to an answer.  do an exercise, you get to an answer. And at the end, you go back, you collect all the answers, you put them in one place.  That's what makes you look at the decision, the final decision, say, oh, yeah, this makes sense because I did all these things before, right?  And if we do that, if we do that, my suggestion is that this one, so I'm changing my design on this one, is this one is individual.  because if you are, like, Let's say that I'm participating in this, right? I'm a participant, I'm this guy. And I save this screenshot, right?  To be honest, the only thing that I care about is this thing, right? The other ones are nice to have, but I don't need to know exactly what they will do from now on if I save this as my, like, the map for my integration.  So maybe we could do is, instead of making this like a group thing, we make it an individual thing, we make copies of it.  Each person brings their answers from the previous exercises, they bring the post-its they selected, they get, like, their own, let's say, canvas, and then you export it, and they get, like, their own document.

41:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  They think it's better because they will care about what they want. Maybe they're going to feel inspired by what others say, but I think it's individual, but...

42:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, they can explore, they can all see the other ones, right? But when the time comes to export that, put it in the email, I think that's cool.  And one of the things we could do to always connect the group to the community is, like, even if I'm doing, like, my own canvas about my own things, and most of the spaces are my own things, we could have a list underneath, like, I did this with these people.  And that's it. You know? How do you feel about that?

42:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm thinking, it's probably like everything, but it maybe just needs something, but I don't know what. But we want them.  To finish with a next step, right?

43:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Correct, yes. Which we get from this, right?

43:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Should we put, I will do this day, or I will do, also, but I'll do, but also, like, when they're going to do it, or that's too long.  You know, like, you put, in the sticker, it's green, it says, I will do X, when, or no? Mm-hmm, I'm thinking.

43:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like, I like the time frame thing. So my suggestion is that we replace this with a time frame.  Because, um...

43:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Time frame, you mean, like, a timeline, or maybe, like, a little calendar, or something like that? attorney's on And communicate my

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I meant like one hour, one week, one month, you know, so I will do one thing in the next hour, I will do one thing in the next week, and I will do one thing in the next month.  Yeah. to, come again.

44:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like that, you know, like they do, they commit to three actions, one in the next hour, in the next day, or maybe the next week, you know.

44:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Because I think most people, it's not very easy to estimate the impacts of things, and the effort of things, right?  So it's very possible, like let's say that I don't know anything about digital marketing, right?

44:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or maybe I think, you know, maybe we can change the margin in a way, you know, like once they decide to evaluate, you know, so they can have this process of of evaluation.  And excited they are about doing the next step. One is how excited are they, and how committed are they.  One is the excitement, the energetic part, and one is the commitment, like, I will do it. So maybe put, like, kind of a dashboard, like, you know, in the Bill Burnett book, Life Design, they do this dashboard of, like, you know, when you are in a car, you know, like, when you accelerate, there's, like, thing going up.

45:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a measurement thing.

45:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So if we measure this through this kind of framework of how energetic and excited I am about doing this and how committed I am to really doing it, we can measure if they are really going to do it.  Or at least they are going to have the time to see, like, They are excited and they want to do it.  Yeah. And I don't know, maybe instead of the other XSR, you know, like what are the consequences of not doing it, you know, or something like to really also get into the pain of not doing it.  Because we also, we just don't want them to talk about the experience or just make pictures of what they feel or they discover, you know.  We want them to become actionable things. So, and also like to put their responsibility onto them, you know, like, you know, I'm doing my work.  I'm the guide. I'm guiding you to see like, in a way, maybe an exercise of this standard of what happens if you do it and what happens if you don't do it.  Something like that. I don't know. Okay.

46:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Because I like this one.

46:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How can I take care of myself? But it's, I think. It's the same as responding, you know, like, what am I going to do, you know, but it's just a more self-care, and this one is more what I'm going to do.  It's more global, right?

47:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. So, generally speaking, let's make this bigger.

47:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or maybe this last one could be, you know, like, the retrospective, you know, like, okay, we already did the evaluation, we did the consequences of not doing it, so, now, if, because the last one, it should be, you know, like, a screenshot that I can send to each one, you know, like, yeah, so.

47:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, let's try to figure out what's the purpose of each slide. Yeah. Okay. So, this slide is about decisions and commitments, right?  Yeah. Okay.

48:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's about, let me see, because I have a, it is decisions, it is committing, evaluating commitments, know, yes, evaluation and committing, you know, like, it's the type, the phase of converging, the, everything we saw, the merging part, you know, it's about evaluating, deciding, and discussing, you know, now, like, where are we going with all of this, know, like, yes.

48:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. This one is about, um, um, I'm just putting this to establish the discussion, I can change it, of course.  this one is a

49:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Recognition and Patterns of Regulus, I'd like that.

49:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this one is about... So in my mind, as we are going to do this... Go ahead, go ahead.

49:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you zoom in the black one to... This one? Yeah. Okay, yes, yes. Bad Patterns of Regulus. And this one is...  Maybe Instate Generation, like kind of the emerging part, it's like... It's not an actual emerging section, but it's, you know, from emerging to closing.  Not the closing part. The closing is decision-making and everything. But right now, maybe, like looking at the values and integrating that is, know...  And maybe the process of translating the experience into insights or into values. Translating the visions into values. Okay, okay.

50:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like that. Into values. Very good. I like it. Because if there's a thing I want to get to and I understand that the values I have right now don't work, I need new values to get to that thing, this is where I have that conversation.

50:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, it's also about getting into the mechanics of translating the transcendental part of life into the integrated tyranny of life.  So I think values is a good compass, you know, to move towards. Okay, and the other one, it's about what did you come from?  Discover, I think that's the emerging part of, you know, like, not brainstorming, but, you know, like, the. The. Okay.  Okay. Thank The inside gathering, know, like, you know, you're gathering, collecting, the collecting part, something like that. Inside collection, yeah.  Mm-hmm.

51:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think this is also kind of inside collection, but in a sense, I think, in my mind, it's very easy to...

51:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  inside recollection and the other one, like, kind of awareness. Okay, okay. Because it's about, like, what was impending me to live my best life.  Appearance of limitations or in, like... Okay.

51:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one was about intention, right? Yeah. Okay. And this one, I think this one It's a very optional exercise, like if you notice that things take too much time, you can remove it, but it's exploring...  Connections. Connections, nice one. And this one is just, you know, it's almost a check-in, right? Check-in and collage is mapping the experience.  All right. Okay. So let's zoom out. How many participants? I arrived at this. I know what this is because I signed up for it, but maybe I signed up for it a couple of weeks ago.  You welcome me and say, hey, this is going to be a really nice session. It's important for you. We will use this session, really integrate all the things you've, you know, experienced in your experience, right?  We will do these things. And keep in mind that... We need to be intentional about this. And maybe, a suggestion, maybe we can even use this slide as an opportunity to say things we expect them to do during the session.  So please put your cell phones in silent mode, try to not open any other tabs, you know, this is for you, open the camera, stuff like that.  We can use this slide for rules of engagement. And then you say, okay, so tell me about what was your doses.  I think it's perhaps also useful. I'd love to know what you think about this. Not just the doses, but when was it?  Because maybe some people were months ago, maybe some people were last week. How do you feel about that?

53:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like it. And the rules for engagement, what do you mean with that? Oh, with this?

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so when you... I pulled this phrase from your past, from your own exercise, right? The other one. What was your intention when you put in this phrase?

54:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That, you know, it's not about the experience. It's about what we do with what we experience. You know, it's about the afterwards.  You know, the experience is just the first step. It's not the last step. So if we are trapped in a pattern, it's not just limiting our potential, but it's a decision.  You know, if we want to change, we need to design a new strategy. Got it. Got it.

54:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when I said rules of... That's a little bit different from what I understood, but makes sense to me.  When I said about the rules of engagement is... This slide is a slide a bit like... So, are at the door with everyone behind you, and you say, guys, we are going in.  Is everyone ready? Yes, we're ready. So, remember, when we open this door, we will want to be present, we will want to be open, we will want to be, you know, honest with ourselves and stuff like that, right?  So, the way to translate that into the workshop is, please open the cameras, don't check your email, it's just like 90 minutes, be present, and so on.  So, these are the rules of engagement.

55:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, I like that.

55:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or kind of agreements, just say, let's try to do it in this way. So, we do the check-in, and we ask when it was.  Okay, and then people come into the college. Okay. When you run this... So with this exercise before, when you did the collage thing, did people understand quickly what it was?

56:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, and they like it, you know, and I use Mural because I think in Mural we cannot export images, you know, like through the Mural.  They need to get out in the pool and, you know, but in Mural, you know, you just click the plus button and you have this bunch of images and it's super quick to move.

56:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so you want this on Mural or Miro?

56:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, I wanted the Mural and I'm going to tell them to get out, but what I like about Mural that time, it's because, you you click the images and you have a bunch of images from Pexels and Pixabay just right away from there.  So that's how the integration they want.

56:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it, got it. But maybe, maybe there's stuff you can do there because there's widgets, right? Yes.  Uh, images. You can put unsplash. Maybe that will be good. Nice.

57:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. Hey, sorry for interrupting, but I have one minute because I'm recording. Oh yeah, sure.

57:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I got excited about this. So, um, I will apply these corrections. Okay. Um, let's meet next Tuesday. Okay.

57:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfect. Same time.

57:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Same time. Okay.

57:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I haven't, uh, get any document about, uh, the proposal.

57:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  didn't send it. No, no worry.

57:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Just if you forgot, you know, like, and just to also let you know, like, uh, maybe you thought that you sent it and I didn't respond.  Um, you know, like, um, didn't send, um, I got excited about this stuff and I don't do the office stuff.

57:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but thank you. The office stuff.

57:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We never want to do the office stuff, but just to let you know, like, all in and okay. I'm going to schedule the meeting.  Can you send me the link just here to have it open? And I'm going to schedule it in a bit when I finish the podcast.  And yes, okay, next week, next week. I like what I'm seeing, and I think this is what I was looking for.  And this is going to be just the fundamentals to keep exploring and move forward in the templatized versions of it.  And yes, I'm excited. Cool, cool. Me too.

58:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Me too. Thank you. I'll send you the link. Have a nice one in the next one. Okay.
