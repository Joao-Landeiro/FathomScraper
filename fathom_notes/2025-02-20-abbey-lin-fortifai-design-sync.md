0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I spoke to Brighton earlier. Brighton is not coming. She has an event at the faculty. And she said, Abby was still unwell, but I don't know if she would join.  you want to use this time to tune us to, if I can help you with anything?

0:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, so we have two messages as our post to them, but I'm familiar with it. So if we can just go over it, if it's all clear, what we need there in design channel.

0:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. So where are we? Yes. So one was about the icon, correct? Archive icon?

0:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes.

0:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we just need another one for the opposite status. Yeah. So for that, I've already spoken to Romeo, which will do it.  You create a version with an arrow in and a version with an arrow out. Something like that. Just two states.

1:02 - A L
  Hello, Eddie. Hello, how are you? I'm alive. No, I'm definitely better than I was a few days ago. I haven't been this sick in a long time, but I'm better.  We actually ended up we're in the cabin and we all ended up coming back to Oslo just to like recover here, which was good because my son was growing up all last night.  So but it was just like, and I think my body just felt better being at home and it was like less like cramps than it was like it's easier.  Yeah, it's a little bit easier. So yeah, it's okay. It's unfortunate, unfortunate timing and everything.

1:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  yeah, it's okay.

1:42 - A L
  Yes. So yeah, that was everything going. I was going to join the call just to see that discussion about the archive thing too, just so

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We were beginning to chat about that so maybe I can just share the entire screen and we move between the references and in this way I won't be sharing the wrong tab as usual.  Okay so there's this, first there was this this point here about the icon for the archive. I don't know if the zoom level is good enough but We need an icon, Romeo and I were already spoke, Romeo will create two versions of the icon, one for archive and the other for unarchive.  It's going to be the box with a little arrow in and the box with a little arrow out just to have something that people might recognize.  Yeah okay so then there was the other thing which is are we treating archive and applicable, right? Yes. Okay so I saw that message reported but it was within the thread so maybe it wasn't visible but here's my thinking on it.  think that non-applicable is not a status. So I would remove non-applicable here from this place. Okay.

3:10 - A L
  Yeah, but I guess my thing is like, there are cases where you want to just delete it and never see it again, and those are possible if you're never ever going to use it.  So I can see people being annoyed that it's like archiving something that they didn't have, whereas archive is important in case you're doing like version two of code of conduct.  And then you need to be able to see where code one is. then you need to archive it. But there should be an option to delete it and let it disappear forever.  that's my...

3:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  The only problem with deletion is if you have lots of imagine a policy that's been deployed and then 200 people request accepted it, or maybe wrote some comments in the future on it or something, and then we upload deletion of it.  It's a bit... We can do it, but it deletes everything related to it.

4:00 - A L
  That's why I haven't been deployed but once it's been deployed you can't delete it. Yeah, sure. Maybe that's the thing It's like they will know quickly if they're not going to use it and ever again, and then they could just delete it Let's just yeah, let's just explore the problem space a little bit more before jumping to the solution space so in which situation with a policy be non applicable so it's for example like There was like a freedom of association policy or like it's like Human rights policy there and then the company says I don't want a human rights policy We're not gonna do it in our organization ever like I'm like actually we had one CFO kind of say that I don't know even if you noticed it with a then The he was like when I was like freedom of association means you're allowed to have unions And like I know that's a touchy subject because in human rights You should be allowed to allow to have unions but most companies don't want unions right so I had put human that in my end The whole training and the communication  and in the training there because that is the right thing to do according to like ESG. But I know that like, you know, he was like, when he saw that, he was like, and I was like, yes, we could delete it if needed.  But like, for example, for something like that, like he might, like if there was a separate policy for human rights or whatever, they might want to delete it and just not ever look at it again, because they're never going to put it into action.  Got it. So am I thinking on this?

5:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, even maybe I interrupted you.

5:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  ahead. No, no, no, no, no, you didn't. Okay.

5:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my thinking on this is, as the platform grows and we have like this kind of template policies and stuff like that, I'm thinking that this looks probably like kind of a library, a template library or something like that.  Right. And I'm not saying it's a new section. I'm just using like an analogy for where these things would be.  Right. So role playing. I am that, I am that CFO. And for some reason, I'm handling the fortify platform myself.  So I open the fortifies time I'm using it and it asks me which one of these do you want to apply to your company?  And I say, yes, I want this, I want this, I don't want this, I don't want this. Because for now my quarter goals are X.  And so the policies and the things that I said I wanted, they go into this sort of thing where I can track them.  The ones that I didn't want, they are not deleted, they're just kept in that template library that I might eventually sometime go there and pick it up, right?  So does this make sense so far? Because there's still another bit, but okay. So to me it eventually, this means that eventually even that much of what we do is helping people know what to do.  It reminds me a little bit of like when you sign up for software or SAS or something and it asks  what do you want to do with this, right? And depending on which answers you give it, it tells you which options you should select, right?  Again, I'm not saying to change screens at this time, is not for this version, just a vision of what it could be eventually.  So I think the non-applicable is not really a status, it's just another kind of a layer in terms of, am I interested in this?  Am I interested in tracking this? Or am I not? If I'm not, I just leave them in the template box.  If I am interested, then it just joins this screen. I think I mumbled a bit, was this clear?

7:40 - A L
  I think that makes sense for ones they haven't started or haven't used. then, but then for the ones that they have done, and then they want archived it, then maybe that the section.

7:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think the currently you cannot mark it as non-applicable unless it's not started. If I'm not mistaken, I have to.

8:00 - A L
  check the code but that's how we have it finally because it doesn't make sense once you start using it or something deploying it means that it looks like or you think you don't have to archive it and that's it so I'm not sure we can we can create this not applicable thing as a flag it doesn't have to be a statement but but we just need to decide what it is actually right now so yeah but I like your idea like and eventually like change it like and I do think we're eventually going to have to change because this ES and G thing doesn't and do search and like like I'm thinking in this short period for launch I think some people like the idea that there is a not applicable because I think they'll be overwhelmed and they'll be happy to be able to move it I think if we can move not applicable either we take it out like I'm fine with taking out the box of it as long as it's archived or not applicable then they can see and then they see that all of those dropped down into there and then my only point was like I think the way that it's dropped down even it goes into quarters like quarter one quarter two quarter three quarter four I think you  need that in the not applicable archive it would just be like one big list of them you know what I mean yeah but yeah that's I agree but we can if we want we can even remove it from this top and the one you see on the screen they're not applicable we can remove it from there so we have only four boxes because yeah yeah that's a really relevant information right I think we should remove it from the box but and then but then when let's also move it so that right now the not applicable's are in I think they're still on the front page they're just marked gray not applicable right so you still see them but ideally it's just like once you say not applicable it moves to the same place where archive is that you don't see it and either they have two one from not applicable and one for archive but I don't know what we think instead of calling it archive and unapplicable we just call it enabled and disabled could we do that you

10:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I guess there is a, I think it's more of a technical question.

10:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

10:15 - A L
  think it's more of a like a semantics question on that definition, right? As a compliance officer, like I will see maybe a lot of like in our, right now we have like 30 policies, right, that are there.  And like, and some of them I just won't want to see ever again and I want those lower on the list.  But maybe the ones that I archive because I've already sent out and deployed, those are more important for me because those are ones I've already deployed.  This is like, I want to see history. want to check who's deployed. I just don't want to get those lost and all the other ones that I don't look at.  You know, I mean, so whether or not there's a color code that makes it a little bit different or a file section, like a section called archive and a section called, you know, disabled, like in there, I think that's what I would say that matters there.  Does make sense?

11:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it does make sense. What I'm thinking is this. If we, by making this change, we need to go back to the compliance map and change things.  I think we are falling into that pattern of keeping a lot of loops open. So even if you know that you'll need that to revisit the compliance map.  Why would we need to revisit the compliance map on this? If when something is not applicable, it disappears from the compliance map instead of just being grayed out.  disappears from policy.

11:40 - A L
  Oh, OK, OK. I understand the compliance map. This wouldn't affect the compliance map. OK, perfect. OK, OK, perfect.

11:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the suggestions so far we have agreed on. Let's remove the gray box from the top. And now if policy has not been deployed,  and archive it. If it has, if it does be deployed, I cannot archive it, correct? You could just disable it, I guess.

12:07 - A L
  But what is disabled?

12:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we have that status? Or not applicable.

12:11 - A L
  You can mark it as not applicable. Yeah, not applicable.

12:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  Let's, let's keep that. it's, if it's not start status, which means it doesn't, wasn't worked on. Let's make it not applicable.  But later in later stages, you cannot mark it as not applicable. can only archive it for now. And later, if you, if they really want, we can also add a third option, which would be delete, and that would completely erase it.  But I'm a little bit hesitant on that one, but we can allow them to do it if they're not start it.

12:41 - A L
  But then we, so we would take away not applicable, then we would rename, would we rename archive to archive slash not applicable?  It's a lot of words, but I don't know, maybe Romeo can do some magic and make it look. It's not about the words that I think it's

13:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Like they mean different things, I think I think it's main is like it's a secondary like view of things that you don't pair them out, but you want to be able to like No, I understand that but I'm thinking like if I am Like Let's let's let's let's not maybe let's maybe not complicate here because I think also we'll get feedback on this final little change It's I would I would I would try to make it quick now and be simple Let's keep it not applicable.  Let's keep it. You can mark this not applicable just for the syntax and people know what it means Mark something not applicable probably means that this is not relevant to my company makes sense, right?  So let's leave that in you can do it only before you deploy this right because if you deploy it you'll have Requests you have some more data related with policy.  You do not want to do that Okay, that's not applicable and then when you have archived archived we can for archived we can move it To archived after it's deployed and then you have a target and that's it and then we cover both cases for now We take  both of these statuses we hide them under the switches that's on the screen and we remove the not applicable from the top part and that's it and then users on their homepage can see only the relevant policies which are in either of these four statuses and that's the only thing that's relevant to them if they want to see the not applicable or archived they have to click on the filters above and then they can see an unarchived something but and that's it for now I would keep it for like that for now until we get maybe a bit more feedback from the users I like the idea of waiting for feedback as a principle I like that but that was the same idea that I have but I think we should just like to close out the loop just right yeah archived slash not applicable on the toggle so then it makes sense and then in on the on the secondary view we want to take out the quarters if you can and so that okay in case yeah in case that the quarter central grouping or in case it will be easier for  And wait, actually it's, it's fine. Yeah.

15:02 - A L
  Okay.

15:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  One thing can be currently the toggle that you see, the toggle archive show archive. I'd like to just show them ties them in the current layout.  So you have two things. It will just show them in the current layout. We don't have a special page for this.  I would maybe wait for them for this, what you mentioned. until we get a special paid for archives and not applicable.  Did you understand what I was trying to say?

16:09 - A L
  Yeah, I think that's fine. Yeah, for now let's just keep it simple.

16:14 - Ivan Ćelić
  The words are like, it doesn't totally make sense because the words stay the same on the other one too.

16:20 - A L
  So do you know what I mean? In this policy you do this and then it's archived and it goes in this policy you still do this and which doesn't really make sense in a view.

16:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but it is archived. guess it is that this policy I don't know if it does this, that's what this policy does but it is archived so I don't know.  It sounds okay to me at least initially but later I would have a separate page where you can list all the not applicable ones and all the archive ones in one place.  I just don't want us to reiterate that we are at this page all over because we need to move on to control so that's my point basically because we

17:00 - A L
  do these small adjustments a lot and I'm trying to just to wrap it up in a way yeah okay I'll have a look at it but I think that's fine yeah yeah okay got it um so this uh Romeo showed a little bit of yesterday we made some some short chance it there or is it not working you probably don't have anything archived can you hold on let me let me check yeah no maybe you can open it I can show you if you want to show or oh yeah yeah shout out to yeah sure sure I'll stop okay go ahead  You see my screen?

18:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. If you go here.

18:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but you don't have any. Can you mark one as an Go to the EMS manual. Yeah, but then there should be empty like if it's there.

18:18 - A L
  No, no, no.

18:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  So how it works currently we can talk about this, but how this works is that this marks this just shows you the archived ones along with the other ones.  That's it. It doesn't show you only archived ones. That's how we implemented it. We can change it though to show you only archived ones, how we did it.  But if you're going to make it work, it doesn't make sense because you want to be able to do yeah, archive this policy.

18:46 - A L
  Okay, and then go back and then click.

18:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Yeah, but then you shouldn't see the rest of these.

18:53 - A L
  That's weird. Yeah, sure, we can agree on a behavior, but yeah, we can agree on a behavior. And then this is what I'm saying in the section you'll review pre-populated make changes within the tone ready to deploy them into your blades and confirm review and then EMS.

19:09 - Ivan Ćelić
  that's a little bit strange but like okay we can live maybe without changing this test that that's not possible on this one but it is weird to have all the other ones so what so what should we do we should show all the archived ones only the archived and only the not applicable in this one can we should we create a like a okay like a tab then switch switch is a bit then wrong component for that because which turns something on and off it's not navigational it's not intuitive to switch for this I agree also actually maybe you should just remove the toggle and just leave the the link at the left at the right of the total right because the thing is it can be confusing if people see something that is archived next to something that is online and they assume that the  is working, but he's not working.

20:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's just a little toggle saying he's not on. So I think it's best if we just take people to the table, so the link right of that.  And then from there, we can pull them back from archive.

20:14 - A L
  Or maybe if we could even look like a table that says archive with the link to all the policies.  I would keep the same layout.

20:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would keep the same layout with the same look or feel of the pages for archive, because that means I wouldn't mix it with deployment stuff just for the sake of consistency.  If the UI and users are used to this being policies, their eyes will be used to this layout for policies then they're to be able to.  It's not like it's more like an audit trip.

20:42 - A L
  They're not going to really look at it in general, only when they really need to. So that's why I was just thinking that.  Yeah.

20:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you go back, Evie?

20:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can you repeat what you said?

20:53 - A L
  I was saying archive is that having it look like a link with just to the ones is fine, because it's not something that.  We're going to look at content very consistent often. It's only when they need to go and look at it for an audit trailer to change something.  it's not like it's maybe once or twice a year that you would need to probably track some as they keep messing up.  So having it as a view, like a link, it's probably not. As long as they can access it if they ever need it to, kind of more of the thing.  So can we just show the same page like you said?

21:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  instead of that table, we can also show this we have layout, we have everything. We just want show groupings and we'll also like a huge list or a list of archived and not applicable policies in one place.  And that's it and keep it simple like that. And then instead of this switch, we'll have a link. Just like we have this one for deployment overview where you click, I think that's what you suggested.  And then we go to the separate page where you see all the archived and not applicable ones or whatever I'm not even sure what we'll put in.  Yeah, I think that works.

21:51 - A L
  I think that makes sense. OK, sounds good.

21:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just to reiterate, we will remove And we'll solve it all with that link that takes to the table.  Question, does it look like this? Table.

22:08 - A L
  will look like it will look like without the sections. it will just be like a long list of either archived or not applicable or something like that.  OK.

22:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so just I like the idea. I love the fact that we were using things just to stress test things, OK?  So let's say it's a page that's a lot like this, but everything is gray, correct? everything is gray or whatever.

22:36 - A L
  What color is archived versus not applicable? So one is like, apparently the same. We said the same just for the sake of speed.  But I'm fine with putting something else, if you can.

22:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then it's all gray, but then these words will be different.

22:48 - A L
  So it's easier for them to search which ones archived and what was not applicable. That'll be the difference.

22:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it doesn't have the numbers at the top. Correct.

23:00 - A L
  Oh, so no point because it will all be.

23:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  Got it.

23:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

23:12 - A L
  And I guess that makes sense because then you don't need to add new policy either because there are archives so you don't need to add a new policy in the archive section.  Yeah, it will just be a list.

23:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  won't have these groupings. It will just be a list on plain background, just a list from top to bottom.

23:29 - A L
  Yeah. Okay. And I think we're out line there. Okay, cool.

23:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this was what I'm about to show is about how to vice officers can improve information that they have received from anyone.  And because this happens at several stages, the direction we took was to create like a component that could be appended to things easily, right?  We'll be just one example. Let's say that you are the compliance officer, and you're you. OK. Let's say you are the compliance officer, and you received a form for gifts and entertainment, right?

24:21 - A L
  me.

24:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I sent you a form from gifts and entertainment, right? And you're checking this, and you see my answers. You cannot change my answer, because you can see my answers.  You can either prove or not to prove. But you can write some comments here, right? So I think we've discussed, like, for a V1, this is good enough.  And as we move forward, maybe we can have, like, specific comments for specific bits of the thing. And then you approve.  And in case you need another approval, there's approval pending. Or if you don't need another approval, just approval complete.  And the basic idea here is this kind of. of screen where there's the dark blue overlay and there's these boxes as mode.  Are you sharing something or just describing? I thought I was sharing. Okay, okay, let's go. But thank you for letting me speak for two minutes, I'm not You're always very descriptive as I cannot understand what you're saying.

25:27 - A L
  Yeah, I was looking okay, but then at some point I was thinking like this. Okay, thank you.

25:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is, you are a compliance officer, you receive a form, you can see the answers to the form, you can approve the form, you can say, man, this is not ready and this is why.  And you can also, I think this is important, you can also say good things when people do their job right, so incentivizing behaviors.  Nice. And this is basically it and the There's an important aspect here, which is whenever we have actions that can only be taken by admin users in terms of validating or leveling up the status of a data collection thing, like a form or a control or anything like that, they look like this.  They have the dark blue background, and this is something that only the admins view, right? As an employee, I'll never see this thing.  It's also a way of signaling that this is an important task, is irrelevant. It doesn't look like everything else on the platform.

26:43 - A L
  Yeah, I like it. think my only thing... Oh, sorry, I a headache. mean, is that eventually, and I don't know that we talked about this before, but like the secondary approver thing, I could just see that...  Yeah, we might need to...

27:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  grow how to do a secondary approver whether sooner or later no we're missing we had it so it's implemented we just need to visually show it i think ah you can you show the top one shall we please yeah that one yes yes yes if you zoom in you can see abby at the top this one oh review one and the review two yes yes and we actually have this already implemented we just i think there are a couple of work that we need to solve but basically we have this is just not in these designs in the old design so this is the secondary so review one is by line manager that you select while while they're and review two is by abby yeah yeah the good thing about these cards is that they are flexible and in the future we could even like put the name or the picture of the person that needs to approve on the second one i mean they're just a prover like in here do you there a thing like the prover because it's smaller companies i don't know how easy it is to set up sometimes it's not the line manager that approves sometimes it's finance manager

28:00 - A L
  So is it like, is there a section that we can add the name of the approver into it?

28:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, it's when the person submits the form, right? So as an employee, and I'm submitting the form, in the future it's easy to see how Fortify knows who is my land manager, right?  Yeah. But for role-watching now?

28:27 - A L
  Romeo made a comment, sorry. Anyway. Yeah, I think he wants to show two different applicants.

28:37 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Go there and I'll click on your post.

28:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just to be sure that you can the same thing always. Go ahead. So you guys just saw a little bit of encrypted comms.  Okay. In the meanwhile.

29:00 - A L
  Okay, here, Romeo is there.

29:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you, Romeo. So there's two options, thank you. Okay, I like that.

29:10 - A L
  It might be easier to read, understand. This one? Yeah. Okay. Or like review, first reviewer, and then, and then review by you, yeah.  Because it's not necessarily my manager, but I think it's always...

29:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, just the wording might change because this page will be both viewed by the second reviewer, the first reviewer, and second reviewer.  So in that case, when you are the first reviewer, then review by you will be probably on the second dot, but that's semantic.  it's fine. Yeah, both of these are fine by me, I guess.

29:44 - A L
  Let's say, no, I like this. The question is, let's say there will be some organizations that say I will find being the only reviewer, like I don't need the bureaucracy.  Could they just stop at the first one, or do they have to... or can they put themselves twice as the first and the second line reviewer, you know, how are we?  Well, the thing is, please choose their line managers.

30:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  So that's a now good question for us. So currently, how it is implemented is a few, when you submit gifts or registry something, you click on the form and then they ask, please enter who's your line manager.  That's for simplicity's sake, because we don't want to get, not right now, we don't want to get into the older organization priorities.  And now the problem is, now the question is, they select, I don't know why, I have the 2dnk friends, I select Abby, and then I click submit, and then you are the my line manager, but you're also super admin, right?  So how do we handle that? That's a question, now. This is how it currently works in a scenario where they select Jal, and then Jal approves, and then after Jal, I'll approved, then that's a good, we have it covered.  But what happens with that is just a question of how we want to handle it.

30:51 - A L
  It's on us. That'll be a rare, yeah, no, but I think that's fine. We can use line manager on this first instance.  I think that it's always good that the line manager now And I think we can catch them putting in a fake line manager by by being the secondary approver because then you would check that the secondary approver.  So I think it's fine. And then yeah, and then we'll worry about this first secondary approver thing that complies the sustainability officer most likely not meeting with government officials and doing that stuff anyway.  So it's I think we'll figure it out when that comes. I like it. personally like the design on the on the right because I think it's less like boxes and stuff.  So it kind of focuses on what you're looking at. I think it's I agree.

31:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  So we're going for this one, right?

31:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it easy to implement?

31:42 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it's similar to both. I'd say we have this. think we use the designer for that mistake. And so it should be pretty simple to add to update action.  have this stage we have to update this whole page to design, but that's fine. was planned.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  all right cool let's go here so now we have some more stuff here on the this is in progress you can go there to see exactly which one is out Okay, so this one is in progress, but the basic idea is we're using the same, so we just wanted to add something to the T-shirt.  We're using the same design language for the forums. right? And we have, there's always some explanatory text box to give context of what's going to happen, what is this thing, and then these things, the questions, each question can unlock all the questions, right?  So if, when it begins, you don't see what's below this, do you have a generator, right? You just see, do you have a generator?  If I say yes, then it says what's the output. And this is not the field, okay? This is just a placeholder.  And you put in the field, put in the output and select the unit would be a drop down. And for everything, we always give the option of uploading a document for the reason that maybe people will feel a little bit more comfortable if they can add whatever.  Let's say, let's roleplay this.

33:53 - A L
  I would either allow for comments or I just say upload, if you upload anything, it should be evidence or  voices. Otherwise there should be a comment field that says like add any other information. Okay okay so in this case would you prefer a comment because yeah that makes sense too yeah I agree.  I would say probably I think comments and evidence upload is good because if you are eventually going to get audited on this they're going to want to know where we've got your figures from so I think that's good to have both.  I would say that so you could do that field could just be cut in half because it doesn't need to be so big it's like one for comment and the other side for evidence.  I don't think this is step by step so it's like not step one, step two, step three because you know like one day you're going to do like step one and then you're going to find the information for step four and then you're going to go back to step two one day you know like depending on when people find the information so I think that it has  to be like you can rename it huh we can rename it to sections or parts or something module module or something like module one or something I don't know yeah exactly so I think that um we have to change and like not go to next step but like yeah um or actually maybe we can do something like instead like it'd be like pedagogical and this be like scope one stationary oh god you know like scope like scope I can't remember I think I think the first three are scope one and then the other two are scope three and the other one is scope three is scope three so like scope one stationary computer scope one mobile combustion step one you know and like name it because I think either that or put it on top of it um so people understand why they're looking at this rather than the steps and then allow them to intertwine like because sometimes they'll find some information first before the other I don't know what do you guys think or I call them module one module two  But they shouldn't be ordered, they'll be so frustrated, because some information is going to come out.

36:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  The thing is, this won't look exactly like this, I think, at least not in the first version. So with the library for folks, we're using it supports pages.  So this is exactly that. This is pages. can page it behind the scenes. We can call them whatever we want to the users.  We can show whatever label we want. That's fine. But for the first phase, I don't think we, I don't think we'll have time to do these boxes for the first version.  So we might have something else, something a bit different, but it will still need to be named. as far as I'm concerned, it can be named scope, it can be named whatever we want.

36:34 - A L
  You don't have to go in there.

36:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  you can go back and forth, and we can only on the last or on, you cannot complete it until you fill everything.  But you can always go back and forth, but you cannot complete it until you fill in all the required fields.  So we are flexible there, I would say. It's just the visual presentation might not be immediately like this. Just because of time and efficiency, nothing, nothing else.

37:00 - A L
  Scope one like scope one scope one scope two scope two and then scope three then at least it feels a little bit more casual I was like why am I looking at mobile combustion Because it's a scope because it's scope one and you you wanted to and and you wanted to Do you scope one carbon reporting?  You know like why am I looking at ways because that's scope three, you know like it just like there's a little bit of of a Understanding of why you're doing it Yeah Yeah Yeah Is there a way to I don't know like also change it like Because then it's like we have to make all of them required like is there like a way to see there's this too That's like if you did like stationary combustions, but you had all of it the mobile combustions You only had like two out of the three Could stationary combustion be green and then mobile be yellow or something, you know, so very easy to see which one  done without having to you know because I can see how frustrating it could be at the end you're like trying to submit but you need something and you know like trying to figure out like or is it going to show up when you submit it and then also you're missing you know chilled water you know like we can have both we can have a preview at the end so it enables us for for example in the end before they submit they can see the whole list of what they have and then like review it and go back to what they haven't filled in we can have both of those things I think the second one is here we can have it like very quickly but the first one we'll have to do a bit of custom development but still doable I just do the first one then I think that's fine yeah waste of scope 3 okay well since I started I don't

39:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Interrupted by Zolli. Oh, it looks good. The model combustion is one. There's the emissions is one. Everything else is two places.  Okay, cool. So, yeah, let's go back here. But so it's just just to be sure we understand that these steps might be a little bit different on the coded version for now, but the basic logic with which is we move from one to the next.  We always have some information text here. And then the forms start opening up as we fill in information so they don't overwhelm people.  And we also have like the include a comment box.

39:46 - A L
  I think you already added it. It disappears so I'm pretty. I see it there. Where? Then, yeah, it's like.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But even yeah, but.

40:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  only cut my I guess it doesn't I one one correction shall is that they don't necessarily need to go step by step it just they just need they can they'll be able to see on top even that they can sit around if they click on top yes yeah yes I'll show you what we can have out of the box but you can also adjust it a bit so we have some flexibility here to adjust so I can also slow my screen once round is so I don't have this copy but just yeah share your screen now okay hold on okay so imagine this now this is to see my page now it's coming up yeah yeah so this is this is like this is not so this what I'm showing this part  This box here is how the users will see the questions. So now imagine here all the questions that you guys created there.  And here you can see list of pages. This can be styled to not called pages, but we can call this, for example, I don't know what you said, that this section one, for example.  And then here you will have section one, two, and then you can click here, you can go in between.  But for example, I can answer something here. I can go here. I'm now on the last page. Then I read something here.  I can click preview. Then I see all my questions. And I cannot complete it before I answer question two, because that one is required.  And I can move between pages. anytime I want to submit, I always see all my answers here. So now I see all my answers.  And then I can jump to, I see this one is required. I can jump to it and fill it in.  This is the simplified version for now. But we can have this immediately. So this is something we don't have to even develop.  This layout, this functionality, this everything. What we have to develop probably is just different representation of this side panel here.

42:00 - A L
  Yes.

42:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  progress, you can see here at the top, this is progress. You can see it here. This is progress per service.  if I delete this, this updates, so this is the progress, but it's on the whole survey level. So it's on all pages.  So it's now half filled in just because section one is filled in and section two are filled in and three and four are not.  So that's why it's half. It's hard to see, but we can style it. can, and you can see here answer two out of four questions.  So then those things we will need to update the design, but we can have this like instantly. This is something we don't even have to develop, but I just showed now.  Okay. Yeah, no, that's good.

42:39 - A L
  So we can start with that.

42:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we can start with that and then update the design as we go to add our custom custom ones and so on.

42:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that's Perfect.

42:50 - A L
  Perfect.

42:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that's it. have to approve the

44:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  wait for that. can do it without questions and then questions will be defined through form later. What I need is, how do you get to the form?  How does that form is visible in controls page? Let's talk. Do we have that? Is that right?

44:13 - A L
  That one might back controls and then the next step for that. Joe, do we?

44:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so so forms and controls are basically the same thing, right? Every form is part of control. So we have the controls on page, right?  If we click on the control, we can see the control, the simplified version, not this thing, right? That we agreed that we just focus on this for now, right?  And we have a title of control where we would explain more information about you to the controls there.

44:59 - A L
  Yeah. more text over there okay and then so for deployment right so once they've deployed then then the most of the follow-up for the forms will be in the dashboard correct they don't really come here after this has been deployed yes because then it becomes a test right because they're a deployment overview or something because like you know how policies on that page to the left yeah we don't have one per control we have it for all controls it's on the control page and that's in because it's not drawn here but we have it yeah or or do we put that into that dashboard page the compliance map dashboard for the home like for the admin view yes because then we see the what  That's not the admin view. That's how we draw the admin view yet. The admin view should be where all the deployments.  Ideally, that's where people go after things have been deployed. don't need to go into, like, everything should be in there, right?  So currently, we have the deployment overview for all controls.

46:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  So if the shell can go back to or show the controls, you can even go to the design, you don't have to go to the app.  So go to controls part. And then, over here, once you maybe go to the left, left to the left, no, we don't have it.  But we have it in the live app. if you can maybe open live app, you have it in another tab.  I'm not sure. It's probably the same as policies, right? Like it's in that corner right there.

46:49 - A L
  yeah, yeah.

46:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK, and then governance. Yeah, so see all requests. Do you see it? Click on that. yeah, this is currently, it's empty, of course.  because we have no submissions in test n. So that's what's empty, but here you would see a table of all the submission parent list.  And then when you click that submission, then you go into the whole redirect or approval that we did previously.  So that's how we intend to do it right now. go back, Joe, please. One back. OK. So this page won't look like this anymore.  So we were thinking that we'll just put this CO request same way we did for policies, like you mentioned.  So the button at the top right, and that's it. I think that could be a temporary solution.

47:31 - A L
  But if you go to the dashboard, it could just go. We can add both.

47:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we could either add both or just add it to the dashboard.

47:40 - A L
  Yeah, but dashboard is not live yet, right, for admins.

47:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  So we eventually, we could get it live, and the question is, when do we need Yeah, I would say that's next step.  So when we work on dashboard, I would definitely add it. don't see any reason why not. I think that's a good idea.  But for now, we need to have it somewhere. And that could be control. I would I would I know we mentioned that we need that work, but I would just finish controls and then immediately start on the deathboards I would just try to wrap up controls first Okay, then how far are we from wrapping up controls now?

48:14 - A L
  we like another week? Yeah, probably another week. Yeah, you think we can be done by next week Well, depending on carbon reporting to be honest, I I Because it's not just car reporting it's also I don't know how we how have we done like the asset manager asset management one and then have we done that That's the one.

48:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  I knew there was another one that was in third party. I couldn't remember yesterday. What was it was asset management?  Yeah, okay We need all the asset management.

48:46 - A L
  We also need one for Yeah, sorry We haven't mapped it out yet together Yeah, so I think we have to do that maybe on.  Oh, I would say that for development

49:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  The problems are not the forms. content of the forms is not the problem. As long as they are similar to carbon reporting, like showed you, that's not a problem.  Think of it as a black box. That black box we can easily put in our app. Development-wise, what I want to know is how much are they different from the other.  So if we need to have a special design in the controls homepage for the carbon reporting icons, for carbon reporting this and that, that's what interested me the most currently.  So I think there's some pages there. Carbon reporting cloud has some options, like where you have to select AWS, Azure or something, and then Apple, something, blah, blah, blah.  So that's what I want to see before I know how much time it takes us to develop it. But at least you can, I think governance is ready, right?

49:46 - A L
  So at least like, could you try to like, yeah, governance. Yeah, yeah, we are doing that. Yeah, we are doing that.

49:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  We'll do carbon reporting and discuss them once, basically lost one there. You're talking about this.

50:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's it.

50:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  So if this is ready, fine, can create tasks for it and see how much time we need for it.  I mean, this is nothing special, but we also need to do the backend side of it, see how we will incorporate this into our current controls and stuff, and then create the UI.  The UI is nothing, I mean, it's not far, it's nothing special, but I just want it to be defined.  That's it, so that we have it ready. And how do you come to this page that you showed right now, the carbon emissions one?  How do you come to this page through which button and through which navigation? I think it's just about cloud carbon emissions and controls, I would guess, and then go into this page.

50:38 - A L
  Right, Che? Yeah.

50:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think it should be just another tab. Now that we have more information, I think it should just get the tab on carbon reporting.  So carbon reporting.

50:54 - A L
  And then you go to another page that goes office or cloud. Is that what you mean? You're showing viral to us.

51:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  you.

51:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is how we collect information for. Carbon emissions for office, carbon emission for data center. So this thing, we have carbon reporting for office and for cloud, right?  Yeah. So if we have carbon reporting for office and for clouds, this means that, yeah, it could be a separate one, yeah, let's not have infinite tabs here, I guess.  Cloud is not scope one, two or three, right? It's just a different thing, correct? Yeah. It's a different thing.

51:42 - A L
  It's a different thing. mean, I think it's scope three, but I can check really quickly. So I would keep it separate because it's also different people.  Yeah.

51:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So. it would be here, right? This is the control section and there's carbon reporting for office, and there's also carbon reporting for cloud, and it's just a thing here.  Yeah, I would do it like that. It would be the entire quarter leaders ongoing, it'd be the ongoing button.

52:17 - A L
  I can maybe just somehow mark it differently if that's needed.

52:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  If not, then we can just have it as one of the controls. My only concern is that all of these controls will be able to be archived, marked as not applicable, all that usual stuff.  my concern here is if that all applies to the carbon reporting. If the answer is yes, then fine. If the answer is no, we need to somehow separate it out of the normal control that we have.

52:40 - A L
  It's scope three because it's carbon emissions done by a supplier of yours. So this is under scope three. yeah, but I could either you can do carbon emissions one and then under it could be like your carbon and then it could be like carbon emissions cloud and then it go to the right and or it could be like  permission office and then it goes to your other part. You know what mean? If you start with this first one, this empty state, it could be like carbon emissions cloud on top and then it goes to the right.  And then it goes to the emission office and then it goes that other part. you want to do that?

53:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't think we should do that because that's another extra page. Yeah, it is another kind of page.  So you can maybe even combine then these first two.

53:30 - A L
  So I like your carbon emissions cloud. Can't you just put that in the first two, put it together so add your cloud provider underneath that?  And then you go to the second one. I'm not telling you the same Add carbon. Like this?

53:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do the first one.

53:47 - A L
  No, meant that one into the bottom of that one. And then, was thinking it's like weird that you go into a page that's very empty, but I like the design.  of that one but here on the left we can have more of this so it can be carbon emission office carbon emission whatever we can have multiple then you know I would that was my first suggestion even but okay I missed it okay I missed it then sorry like this page seems very empty this first one like this it doesn't totally make sense because you're going from that other control page where you're going in so suddenly go to this page I would say you can just be like okay you're gonna start like so add your provider and you go you know you can just kind of combine both of them into a page to save so they people know immediately and then they go to the right that was just a thinking but why don't you just put it here like as two separate items yeah you can I was just like I just like the picture we can we can maybe as well maybe maybe a bit of okay I'm like

55:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  work but in the middle of both solutions. Basically here we can have some kind of a special item in this list or special section with a special design in this list.  Maybe if you can just drag that whole section above the mission and just try to cram it somewhere in here.  Just do it now. I know it's ugly for now but just an idea so that they can see that these are special controls in a way because they are right there but they are special in a specific way.  You can just change the control section icon to that guy.

55:34 - A L
  I would maybe instead change the guy you know like I like him but I'm getting a little tired of him in every section and like we changed him into like yeah we changed that guy that Romeo found and put him in this control section.  Okay but we still have a problem of where we put carbon emissions.

55:53 - Ivan Ćelić
  we put it in this or not? I agree with you.

55:55 - A L
  agree with you.

55:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  No I think we do what we agreed so.

56:00 - A L
  we're going to put it in the ongoing one and then put carbon reporting office and carding reporting. Okay, do you want to mark it somehow specific?

56:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  you want to mark it? No. Can it be archived? Can it be archived, for example?

56:19 - A L
  Yeah, I guess if they don't want to do scope one and two recording, we can't force them to. So they should be able to archive the controls.

56:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  And mark not as applicable. Can that be also done? Mark is not applicable on those controls. Yeah.

56:33 - A L
  So, question.

56:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  If they don't do scope three, some of them will not want to do scope three, correct?

56:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

56:52 - A L
  We shouldn't have scope three here. So my thinking on this, maybe some might only want to be able to do feel like they could only get scope one info and can't get scope two or three, or like, or we say you submit it knowing you're not going to like, what's a good point because sometimes you can't find the info, right?  like, they give up halfway, can't afford them to do it if they don't want to do it. It doesn't matter as much if they don't want to get audited.  But eventually under the regulation, I feel like they're going to have to do it, but we still have some time until that regulation kicks in.

57:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, let's let's maybe make it as simple as possible. So we can have it in the controls list. And now it's only correction of what exactly will be in controls list.  So one item is a carbon emission office carbon emission cloud, right?

58:00 - A L
  No, no, we all agree on that, but Joel has a good point, it's like, if you look at this list, right, we're saying carbon efficient office, and we're saying you should look at scope one, two and three, like that's on there.  Yeah, but what are scopes?

58:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  What are scopes in this carbon emission stuff? I know you guys discussed this, but I'm not understand the scope of it.  scope means? Um, scope.

58:23 - A L
  Okay, so there is a way of categorizing your carbon emissions. So scope one, I just wanted to do this, I can't totally remember, but one is like you directly, you directly impact it.  So it's like your electricity in your rented, your in your office, it's like your company directly impacts it. Scope three is that somebody acts on your behalf and impacts it.  And then it's defined.

58:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Those are different categories or what are those? That's what I'm trying to understand is these like a parts categories of your emissions, right?

59:00 - A L
  of carbon emission and scope one and two in the industry scope one and two has become like the baseline of what you can do because scope one and two is like really easy it's like electricity and it's like it's electricity and it's like rather or not you have lease cars and if you don't then you you should be able to do it so that's like almost like a baseline everyone should do it if they're even prying a little bit scope three is where it's like it's no man's land people are grappling with it they can't figure out how to do it but that's like that's actually where most people's most people's impact is and so that's kind of where the roles were raised people are trying to figure out how to get to scope three how do I think figure it out but if you try to touch a little bit of scope three which is what I did in my last company which is like waste which is I asked all these like experienced consultants I'm like which is the easiest scope three I can track they're like waste and I was like good because then I could check off and saying I'm doing a little scope three then then you have scope three and waste because that's possible to do like a little bit easier than the other ones  And now more with the data center, you said the cloud people are making it a lot easier to figure out your carbon.  So that's another scope three thing that you can put in there and say that you track it.

1:00:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would, I would then do what, what the job posted in chat of this, I would split it up in four different consoles.  I would maybe try to have four different items in our list, which would be called like Joe wrote in this.

1:00:25 - A L
  Yeah.

1:00:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. And that way we can even group one and two if you say that the baseline we can make it one and two together and say scope one and two and have it all in a single control in a single form.  And then we can have three and three clouds. We can have it as a separate forms, which you don't have to necessarily fill in, but you can.  And then we can track it easily if someone is doing three or one only and so on.

1:00:49 - A L
  I'm, I'm, yeah, I think that looks, I think that's good. I'm, I'm happy with that.

1:00:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I'm also happy from the depth side. with this solution. Everybody's happy.

1:01:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just to make sure we don't lose the decisions. We will split the carbon emission forms by scope. We will have a separate form for carbon emissions cloud.  Anything else in terms of like this the brother strokes thing?

1:01:37 - A L
  There's one thing for carbon emissions you just like the third point that you put this right carbon or emission scope three waste so then because it's only waste that we're looking at right now because eventually we might add like business travel we might add some of the other ones which is on your chat and that chat function but no it's fine we can change the name of it anyway if it gets more clarity and we can also

1:02:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  If we later think of something else that we don't or you want to add something I will just add another item and that's it.  No, I think that's true Like eventually business travel or something like that flights can eventually be in there Okay A quick question just just just to confirm something just to confirm my understanding so this carbon emission is a control which you fill in as a Chief officer chief officer or whatever and then know who feels this in it's usually an office manager in the office Or it's like a supplier like it's like okay It's not you don't deploy this this this is not deployed for example.  Do you don't need to deploy? To the whole organization, but it is deployed person in within the organization

1:03:00 - A L
  probably, or two people within the organization. Maybe a first special, then like an external person. I could decide to fill it in or something like that.

1:03:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Then another question related to that is do we need to be able to deploy to user or user groups the same way we do for policies?  Do we need to do it for controls?

1:03:19 - A L
  Not all, but some. On the G side, you need to deploy it to all. On the E side, I think it's mainly, it's not these that you need to deploy.  I think it's possibly the asset management depending on how we want to deploy that. And then the environmental suggestion form needs to be deployed to all of these.

1:03:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  But let's say that all of these that are deployed to everyone except Carbon and maybe these couple of specific ones that are deployed to certain users, right?  But all others are deployed to everyone, right? Yeah. Okay, for now, then we don't need to implement. deploy to groups or to people for now.  We can later edit, of course, if you see the need.

1:04:05 - A L
  Yeah, but on the G side, you will, but not for E, yes. On G side, we need to be able to pick out users.  Yeah, well, yeah, possibly, because there might be, for example, officials. In some corporations, there's only a handful of people that work with government officials, just like the public affairs group.  So you only wanted to play that ideally to that.

1:04:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, but it couldn't happen that someone comes in with a government official relation. That's not in that group. then it's a bit.

1:04:36 - A L
  But I feel like some of them might not want to bother their employees with a huge, like, or confuse them.  Well, actually, you don't bother them, right?

1:04:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  Because that's a form that's available to everyone. And if it happens to someone in the company, they know where to fill it in.  can always point to them.

1:04:50 - A L
  I hear you, but I don't know. I think they might feel like, I think, like, from what I've seen, sometimes companies want the minimum.  possible, like not to bother them as much. So I think if we can avoid it, that would be good.  But if not, then it could be also like factory workers versus, you know, office workers. So like some factory workers don't need to do this because they're not going to do it and some office workers will need to do it.  So I think the groups is kind of needed there. Okay. Yeah, we'll add deployment options for all controls.

1:05:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  then you can always choose for the G side.

1:05:33 - A L
  the G side and deploy, I guess you can also deploy to individual, right? you can also, yeah, deploy.

1:05:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  So basically, you have policies, you can choose one or group.

1:05:44 - A L
  We'll have it the same way and then you're flexible. Yeah, yeah. That sounds good.

1:05:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then I have another question. I'm not sure if you have something else. It mine is also related to controls.  It will be a quick one because I know we're already in here for some time, regarding the statuses of controls, because in the design we have status completed, for example, which doesn't make sense in a way for ongoing control to be anytime completed, right?  So that part is a bit unnecessary, I would say, so completed when it's ongoing control completed, one question. And then the second question is do we need to post state for the control, because some controls, you maybe want to post them, for example, you put in git registry control, and then you suddenly want to post it and prevent people from killing it in until you do something, I don't know, whatever.  So regarding the first question, I agree.

1:06:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What was the name? The current name is completed, right?

1:06:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, the green one at the top, and we have that status, but I don't think we need it for controls, at least not for all of them.

1:07:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean like yeah, so my thinking on this is perhaps complete what does completed mean because what the compliance officer wants to know is that do I need to do something about this or not right so if I name it up to date it works for every situation right or something like that or valid it is a bad name valid is a bad name but like this kind of thinking so if the final if the final stage is you know active or not completed because completed is at the end of our journey and active is a status that could be at any point right no but like but the usage of it and this is I think it makes a little bit confusing versus like the deployment part and then an ongoing monitoring right the deployment one it means that you've actually actively tried to do this control and you've deployed it so that deployment

1:08:00 - A L
  payment part is complete, but then there'll be ongoing follow-up throughout your time, you know what I mean? Like it's kind of like you've done a you've completed the deployment of the policy, but the policy still needs to be signed off and everything like that and there's going to be tasks on it, no?  Active sounds like a very good word for that, doesn't it?

1:08:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  So after you deploy it then that means that the control is active, right? And that means that it's actively being filled in and it's actively reviewed by you or followed up by you or whatever, right?  Yeah, okay, no, that makes sense then.

1:08:36 - A L
  like that.

1:08:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:08:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  So my point is when do we say something is active? soon as it's should we then even have deploy status for control?  Should we just name it active? So you deploy it and then it becomes active. We don't have even deployed state for control then, what do you think?  Well, can you please open the control? in pygma just control click on the controls pages as we are looking the same thing that I'm talking about thanks yeah and so this is the current state of the controls these at the top are not really applicable to controls right because we have completed completed doesn't mean anything and deployed also deployed basically once you come to the deployed part of control then like you said it's active it's being worked on so maybe activism the right term that we need to replace merge deployed and completed here for controls together and name it active something like that you know maybe again yellow one and yeah and then make it completed or up this and then I think step one would be just rename completed to active because I think that also conveys that everything else is not active because right now some people

1:10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could I have questions? What's the difference between the board and completed? I think active it's still have a problem.  We still have a problem when when something completed.

1:10:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  So what is the logic? So in the code or in life, whatever, what's the in real life? What's the logic when something becomes completing for policies?  It's pretty clear policy policy is completed when all of the employees mark that policy as I acknowledge. That's clear.  But what for control that are ongoing? There is no condition in which it is completed right because it's ongoing.  It's something that's continuous that's active. So it the final condition of final status of control is active, right? So I mean, we've been on a meeting for an hour and something I believe everyone's concentration is low right now.  So we can also discuss this tomorrow. I don't think this is urgent that we don't have to have a conclusion on this right now.  But it is something that we need to update then and address before we release just so that we know what we  Yeah, let's let's come back to this tomorrow and with a fresh mind, but basically something to think about is the statuses of control.  They cannot be copied over from policies just that we just have to adjust them to fit the use case of policies.  That's all of control. Got it. it.

1:11:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think I think that that principle makes a lot of sense.

1:11:24 - A L
  Jao, do you have time on Monday from like after one to go over the rest of the controls just to make sure we have them?

1:11:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  After one, your time, right? Yeah.

1:11:43 - A L
  Or I can start there, but I don't think you're pretty fine.

1:11:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so currently, so right now for you, is almost five o'clock in the afternoon, right? Four forty three. Okay.

1:11:58 - A L
  So, and your question?

1:12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For Monday, what time was it? I'm pretty much free all day, so I can move things around for you.

1:12:07 - A L
  Half past one works for me.

1:12:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Half past one, your time, your time works for me. And I have like one hour and we have the customer feedback thing.  I think I might move that one.

1:12:24 - A L
  That's actually one of our investors. That's our investor. But let's just say two, three, because I think it's more important that we get our, we get this control right to the launch on time because we're already delayed a little bit on this.  Okay, but let me, okay, let me put this in then so we can, and then I maybe move her to a little bit later to another time.  Okay, okay, great. I'll ask Brighton too because she knows some of the things. All right, anything else then? No, I think this is a very productive conversation.

1:13:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, thanks, guys.

1:13:04 - A L
  Very looks good. you.

1:13:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Bye.

1:13:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  Have a good day. See you, brother.

1:13:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bye. Wee.
