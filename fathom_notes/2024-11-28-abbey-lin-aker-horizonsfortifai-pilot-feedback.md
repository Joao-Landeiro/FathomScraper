0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  stuff.

0:00 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  I like to just ask a few running off questions to just complete the arch. I don't know if do you want to run and share from your screen or do you want Pinar to do the picture?  I could be for her to share from the prototype that you made.

0:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like sometimes like on some meetings I work really well and then some meetings I somehow got in the wrong setting and then I couldn't get out and then all is like a fail in the meeting when I was like fine with it.  That happened to me earlier as well because I got stuck but I wasn't really reading what was in front of me, typical designer stuff.

0:44 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It was obvious and Pinar was kind of rolling her eyes.

0:49 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  So this is our actual app, right?

0:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So you can see the app here and then you have the procedures and training. So you can see that is there, you can see, you know, a policy is there.  So it's kind of amazing like what has been done so quickly.

1:09 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  I see Amari, I'm going let her in.

1:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  yeah, so it's cool.

1:14 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  All right.

1:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we run through the last two workflows.

1:16 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah. Yeah. I think we can do that.

1:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hi, Marie. How are you? Hi there.

1:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Can you hear us?

1:25 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Okay.

1:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Great. So I wanted to, before we jump in, maybe we could introduce Jean to the conversation and then see.

1:36 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  saw Mal at one point because I don't think maybe dropped out, Jean, do you to introduce yourself?

1:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sure. Hi, I'm Jean.

1:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's a very difficult name to pronounce if you're not a native Portuguese speaker. So don't worry about it. And I'm joining from the design team.  I'm from Dois, helping fortify to keep designing the. So the experience after the eggs team made such a good working, organizing everything else in the structure and the architecture of everything.  So we are going into the weeds right now.

2:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So Shao and his team will be kind of taking over after Rui and Pinar, like this is kind of like a handover meeting also for you to meet them in the process.  And they've all worked together in the past, that's also it's very good too for the transition process. And then we have a short meeting today so it's more just to one update you on kind of the different flows so you can look at them and then talk about you know what interests you in them and is in you know January timeframe is there any parts of it that you would like to test out to actually start testing out in the organization based on what you see.  So I think that's kind of the goal and I think Rui has some follow-up questions too throughout the process.

2:56 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  So since we're closing off our part in this process. We have developed five or six workflows. I think we have worked through four of them with you and we just wanted to show the two last ones and then to complete the art there just to ask you some questions in terms of hearing your reflections of what you've seen so far.  So I think we will dive into these two last ones which are third party management and risk assessment. Correct.  So Pinar take it away and share your screen maybe. Can you see my screen?

3:43 - DUMLU Pinar (Sopra Steria)
  I had so many different screens so I hope you can see the correction one.

3:47 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah well we see the we see the prototype and maybe Abby you want to do the narration of Yeah I could at least this part has changed slightly because there's a thing on the left that says plan

4:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  do something act. I can't really plan, do, check and act. And I don't know if you recognize those, Mari, but those are ISO, uh, ISO terminologies that you kind of have to be able to show.  So we're really, you know, placing this off around the ISO so that you can pass ISO 37,001 on the governance side if you are to do this process.  And so we also did this so that the auditors recognize, you know, where everything says that the requirement for that.  So that's where the plans do see act things from. Yes. So we're going to go through third party management, right?

4:40 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah, you can go to third party management.

4:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I'm not sure. know we want to do this with Linda Hedro. How we did we go through this with you, Mari, before this third party?  I don't think we did now.

4:54 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So this is like, as I'll just talk through the third party management process.

4:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We're trying not to be you know, a supply chain management tool. So we're thinking about again, what is the solution of this, right?  So instead of trying to do a lot of the risk assessment from within the tool itself, we're kind of saying like number one, just get like an accounting ledger or whatever of your spend.  And then if you scroll down, then we say, you know, you know, find the, you know, there's directions. Like I think the first one is like, you know, look at 2%, top 2% of your spend.  If it's on the list, end with like 20 to 50 repainting suppliers, but you also need to refine them by, you know, sector and country, products and services, you know, investigation and reputation.  So that like, and then you can download the template that we give so that it can be uploaded and used.  So a lot of this, you know, can be in a very, you know, Rolls Royce third party tool that they do other risk tiering, but ours is like, no, you do it offline.  And then you kind of upload once you have that to try to simplify the process. Yeah, like the recipe approach because I think that people do it.

6:00 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  different ways than actually I just did this myself today and yesterday for two different companies and I didn't do it this way but you know that's why it's good to have a standard also this weekend this is what we did.

6:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah so that's also good too because we could also see yeah did we do it the same way as you and if not maybe we could put your process in here if it's like more standard process.  So then you import the list that's in the process and it comes into a list like your final 20 or 30 so this is not your all the supply chain because of the ones that you actually want to do and then there's an area for questionnaires that you can send to to the vendors there.

6:38 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Can I just ask an interrupt to think again just to make sure I understand the where we're at. So this is a part of the risk no this is part of the dos and this is the implementation of the compliance framework and you had controls under there implementation of controls and you looked at them basically the high risk vendors this recipe here here the three steps  was to identify high risk vendors, right? Yeah. Yeah. OK.

7:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So these are high risk vendors.

7:06 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  so these are the high risk vendors.

7:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then like some of those that you're going to, then is it we're saying we're going to do the research or are we going to go into the questionnaire?  can't remember, Pinar, there was a one point where is it like really that we're supposed to do it? Like I think I send questionnaire first then, but we see the questionnaire and maybe that's not in this flow or?  Believe so. It was here, but now I can't see it.

7:31 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  So I was going to ask if someone removed it.

7:34 - DUMLU Pinar (Sopra Steria)
  But is it underneath the setup part or like?

7:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  maybe it was up here.

7:41 - DUMLU Pinar (Sopra Steria)
  Oh, yeah, I don't know how to delete that.

7:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But maybe we could, yeah, we can maybe find that flow from there. We could also show it from there.  So then there's like a questionnaire that you would review, but then there's also additional. Yeah, so. Yeah, so send the questionnaire to all vendors and then go to the right, think, or, yeah, view the questionnaire, I guess it would be right there, and then, yeah, view the questionnaire, and then you click view the questionnaire, and then it's like then, like there's general questions, like right now we just have social ones, but I think we could, we'll do ES and G questions that you have, and that you could, because we did this in the risk assessment part, where you can decide you want to ask E questions, S questions, or G questions there.  Yeah, and then, and then they need to answer yes or no, and then upload the file on it. And then, yes, and then you send the questionnaire to them.  Yeah, and then they get a question that they need to respond. I think this one needs to probably be flushed out a little bit more, which also could be good since you're going  through this process that we'd be able to test it on that. But that's kind of the thinking and then they would get a questionnaire and then they can go into a portal to respond to it.  Yeah you can see the vendor details if you click on that and then yeah where you would see it you could say do you want to have a follow-up meeting?  Do you have any more notes that you want to share around them? Yeah create new tasks related to them so you know and follow-up and then there has any kind of change log that's there.  And then the ESG risk if you go up the ESG risk ESG status that is yeah like this is what their surveys are this is any documentation that they they might have to share so that you can put that as kind of a placeholder there.  So yeah so that's kind of third-party management and then you have a dashboard but I'm not sure that we actually have that.  dashboard part there, but it'd be good to see what you're interested in seeing there. But that's the third party management kind of area.  Yeah. What are your thoughts on that, seeing this?

10:12 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So I think this looks like a company that is just starting to implement the compliance program, right? So you haven't really gotten started with IDPs, for example.  Yeah. But I think that this like having an overview of where you have IDPs and how to follow up, that is very helpful.  But for example, for me, I have never been in the situation where I say, oh, here are the suppliers.  We don't have IDP on any of them, right? It's more that you would have IDPs and they would come in in the beginning before you start a supplier relationship.  Possibly because we're a mature company, but I think even like immature companies would come there relatively soon. But also I felt a little bit like you're mixing too far in the process because there is also a process where you  look at the vendors and check that you have an IDD in place, for example, and check that, okay. So what I said, what I've been doing for two different companies over the past in this week only is look at, okay, let's look at the top 30 suppliers for this project.  And then look at, okay, what do we have IDD in place? Does it make sense that the right legal entity is the same as we did IDD of them?  know, just to be like, it didn't make sense, do you have any questions? And a bit same way, I just did it for Accra license as well, like what are our vendors?  Is there anything like, are we following procedures for these vendors? And is there any risk that we want to follow up?  So I would look at that more in sort of fires because I had thought about having IDD itself because IDD can be its own control.  this in our business for example is that someone so we have like a business responsible right they would come to me and say look I am planning to enter into a joint venture or contractual relationship with company X do we need to do an IDB and then I check the procedure or I know it may be already and I say okay we need to do level one level two or level three and then level let's say it's level two because that's where you have the question is level one for us is just the screening in compliance catalyst and in that case you could you have something similar where you say okay but yeah to say okay that you have a you could have an overview of what kind of IDBs you have for a given company and so level one would be the screening level two would be the screening plus questionnaire and then you get the questionnaire back and it will also be helpful to have the conclusion of that questionnaire okay we found yes it's okay to enter into a relationship but make sure you have these in these classes in the contract right that would be like the overview  the feedback from reviewing the questionnaires when they come back. Yeah, quick question. One, can I record this so I can have some feedback?

14:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Great. then the other question is like, so are you doing because the way that I have set this up is like we're not even doing the low risk ones just because it's kind of too many, you know, too many.  Like I don't want this to be a set like a huge tool because then you could have so many lists.  So like how we kind of set it up is like you automatically get only the high list, you know, like these are the high ones that you need to send questionnaires and you need to follow up.  Is that like do we have to have something low risk? yeah, there are some companies like you know like all 60,000 at least need to go through like a basic pet or something or Adele Jones and like you know get all that out of the way.  Or do you think it's like that could either be in the controls process as like kind of IDD or like whatever check or like in this third party management process?

14:56 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Like can it be only the third party management or either high region risk or let's say so for example in our procedures we already have an exception for let's say renal law firm providing regular advice like off-the-shelf products less than five thousand kronor for example we would not do an IDD so it's already taken off and then there are quite a few companies where we only do a level one screening and that's like that's would be a pep check and you know database search negative media see if there's anything that we should be aware of and if you don't find anything then then that's fine you conclude and it's probably also possible to take that out of the third-party management process and just include both for the screening there was a red flag we need to do additional IDD I think for me personally and but also because we're relatively small companies the numbers are maybe limited but I would find it helpful to have sort of a track record of all the IDDs where it's like okay here's something that came to me this was the conclusion from it  This was what I told management to follow up. Yeah.

16:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess it's because maybe that would be better in the control box called IDP or background check. then this part is like, if you want to send out or interact with your suppliers and get the questionnaires, could that like.  So according and maybe some companies do it like the way you're proposing here.

16:24 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  The way we do it here is that we send out the questionnaire in a more organic approach. I wouldn't pick 10 suppliers and send them all a questionnaire.  They would be done when a company or a person from a business comes to me and say, I need to do an IDP and if I do a level one screening and find that I need a questionnaire, then send the questionnaire or we say, okay, this engagement is somewhat high risk.  We need to do a questionnaire right away. So then we send the questionnaire in the beginning of the relationship.  So it wouldn't be a supplier at the time. It wouldn't be in a registered and internal databases either. If it's more like a workflow, you see.  But that is the complicated workflow and it would probably be useful to have a tool to support it. I just wouldn't subtract it from the current suppliers.  Interesting. Yeah, because I guess you're...

17:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's like two different methodologies. Because some is like, okay, we haven't done anything and now we need to do something.  So we need to grab a map. did the company is like, okay, we haven't done anything. We need to do what we need to understand what are high risks and do that.  And then this is how we would do it. But yeah, there is another maybe process that maybe we can actually have another conversation about where we can actually map out, because maybe we can make that digitalize.  we do this once, this is an exercise that you do once. But then once you do it, you have a new process that you kind of do it that way and are able to capture it.  yeah. How would you do something on the checking of suppliers that you do regularly, is more like forensic or risk assessment or just a spot check.

17:56 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Is there anything here that we should look at in more detail? And that's more... Like I think you said as well under the check part, like are we actually following the procedures?  there anything in the supplier list that we should be aware of? No, it's a good tip.

18:14 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  I'm also looking at the book.

18:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, no, I think it's because I think yeah, we have third.

18:22 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  No, do we have a third party risk management?

18:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We might need to I was thinking we are on our design list or maybe it's not and maybe we need to revisit based off this conversation.  maybe, Mari, I'm going to probably pull you into another conversation to kind of get this in more detail. Okay, but yes, go on, Rui.  Risk assessment, right?

18:42 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yes. We have done an attempt at covering this as well. Maybe again, Abby, you can narrate it succinctly.

18:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so we tried to like, this is just like around EES and G. So it's like, you know, familiarize yourself with the risks and then  then you collect the baseline data like from like ask a questionnaire around that and then you review and send the questionnaire and then it a kind of a risk tiering on it.  But I think if you start up on the top, familiarize with your typical ESG risk, you enter there and then you have like typical risk that you would would have just so and then you have eyes to try to understand you know what what is actually these type of risks there and then you go to the right like start the risk assessment risk management and then it goes to the questionnaire like saying like okay now you've seen these risks but have you looked at external resources like transparency after SASB or universal human rights?  Yes you know show the evidence or that have you looked into internal resources like companies policies and reports yes have you know have you done research on competitors yes evidence you know have you done research on the company that operated you know research on industry and then if so then if there's additional risks that you've identified through these  then add them here below on the on the risk, you know, you evidence to all of that. And then once you add the new risk as part of the process, then you can add or yeah, you could do that at a risk there and then additional risk one and additional risk two.  And then it goes to the quest those automatically are generated into the questionnaire that you have like, yeah, like with bribery with organizational things and that so yeah.  So you have like typical ones that are in ES or G and then you have additional risk one and additional risk two and then they're not that.  Yeah, they're they're risk tiered by probability impact on an organization and impact on society. That's kind of how it's done.  And then you can send the questionnaires to internal or external stakeholders that we want to do review the risk assessment.  Yeah, and then you send the question. there and that's kind of how that and then it comes back with another part that like wrist here we're still trying to figure out around how like when it comes back how does that wrist picture look but that's kind of like the thinking around that but uh yeah do you want to give your thoughts on that yeah it's not finished oh oh it's not okay sorry go you should keep going okay wrist profile yeah okay so you have it here i didn't know that it was there okay yeah you can click on that yeah so then you kind of have like a completion of how many people responded where have they responded on some of them and you know what are the different risks you know based off of that and on that so that's how you would do that and then ideally they're kind of matched with some of the controls that you're going to be putting in that you get a controls list that says okay which controls given this risk which controls do you yeah yeah and then like so then like you say these are the recommended controls that you should have based on the list that you should have as a conflict of interest register  and all of that. Yeah and you can connect and then you can yeah and then you confirm the controls to that.  Yes so yeah what are your thoughts on looking at this high-level risk assessment?

22:20 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah it reminds me a little bit what I've seen some companies do with like internal service to to support risk assessments and get a little bit more facts perhaps.  Is it possible to add sort of more objective information into the assessment?

22:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah we had that say think of like after you've done all that checklist and add like risk that you want in there but are you asking like to place it somewhere else?

22:50 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  I'll just give an example of how so when I did our assessment for 2024 I looked at what are the  countries that we're in, right? How many of them are high-risk countries? In these high-risk countries, how many projects are in the construction phase?  Because construction phase is like the phase where you have the highest risk. How many of those projects are we majority owner of?

23:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we have that in like number four, then you would click yes and evidence, and then in there would be a drop-down thing that you can store the research that you did, so you can write a note and upload it, and then if you click yes, then there's a thing that opens up that you can add more information.

23:40 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  on the floor there, the country, what would come up as a question?

23:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It doesn't really come up with a question. It's more like summary. get to add whatever notes you want to do around that.  There's no specific question, and then you can be like, I researched blah, blah, blah. I see this, blah, blah, blah, and the construction side.  I think that construction risk is that you're you know audit evidence that and then you add that as a risk that you might see there so that was the thinking that um but yeah um but yes but I guess we have five minutes so it's not a lot of time but luckily you you're very close by in the office you're like one minute away but um really yeah I have many but it's not we don't have a lot of time if you want to continue another 10 minutes yeah I can stay for more yeah four or five minutes yeah let me see I think I might actually be okay to stay a little bit longer I think I don't think I'm going to check right now yeah we can stay yeah okay that's great we so we've looked I mean we've looked at this we've been showing you all those workflows that you see on the left um and I just wanted to get a sort of holistic impression from you

25:00 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  looking back at these different stages of development, how would you describe your experience as a pilot user? mean, what stood out the most to you throughout the process?

25:17 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  I think maybe, so what you showed me last time, I found to be perhaps more easily implementable without adjusting it too much.  While both of these tools that you showed me today, I feel like would be more helpful to have if we could adjust them to fit, you know, the way I, I don't know, that my preference would be in like developing risk assessment, for example.  So in it, like, it's maybe a more useful tool, but I feel like it's not, like, for example, in the risk assessment, I feel  like the survey doesn't give you the accurate information about where, if you're sending it out to like the internal stakeholders, they probably don't know where the risk is.  So I would look at the risk based more on like, where are the projects, where do we have intermediate areas, what kind of adventure, like it's a different kind of approach, but if I could have that and then like, for example, if I could have a systematic approach to that and do that for each of CDR in each country, that would be very helpful.  You can just have all of that in the system and then with that additional assessment you had of like, okay, you have this risk, what kind of internal controls do you need them, that is very useful.

26:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So if you go back to the compliance map, yeah, like which of those like, would you feel like, okay, I could use these now or I would like to use these now, like policy procedure training or communications or controls, because I do feel like for like, larger companies that have established, it will be like, I like this, this and this.  I don't do this because I really have, you know, I really have a whistleblowing hotline, so I don't need to do this.  I really have this part, but this part would be really helpful in terms of controls and your conflict of interest survey.  You know, I can imagine that for larger, like, you know, like more established companies that have that versus like a company that doesn't have any compliance officers that are like, I'll just use yours to go through.  But are there any like parts of this that you feel like, okay, I could use this and this would be helpful at least in my day-to-day, even if it's not everything, you know?

27:27 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  But to be completely honest, I don't remember what's under each of these, like the policy procedures and training. Yeah, They're like, I would say that maybe we could go through.

27:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it's controls is probably more like policies. It's more like, here's the policy. You can edit the policy.  can deploy the policy. Same thing with the training. Conflict of interest is more like, okay, here are all of the annual conflict of interest declaration.  Here are a conflict of interest of sponsorship donations, government officials that people can use for reporting. And then you send it out.  So that's more of the control aspect of it. I think government officials, for example, that's relevant for us.

28:04 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So I don't know if government official is the one that's working that we have.

28:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  might be sponsorships and donations, but you can click on sponsorship and donations, so they can at least see because it's kind of similar anyway, we're just in entertainment.  So it's like, it's like, yeah, select type, that this would be like, you know, government officials, like in what country, you know, we have a, it's a forum for government officials that you would stand up and see.  So that's one. And then you're employed for deployment. So employees have a employee portal, which we haven't really shown.  Maybe we can show the employee portal number six on the left. So if you go to the left, if you're not, yeah, we don't need to show that part.  Yeah, okay. Like then they would have an employee portal part that they would be able to submit like government officials and meetings and all of these different things that they wanted to submit conflict of interest.  Or, and this is where employees would go to find out, like, if you're deploying the annual. that they've been transformed, would come, this is like their own portal that they can do and submit there.  So then you have this information ideally in real time where are around that before. So that's the control part.  then the policies, procedures, trainings is the typical, yeah, communication and confirming that they've received the policy and they've read through the policy and the training.  Can you go back to the compliance map?

29:25 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  know, yeah.

29:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Is there any parts that you feel that would be interesting in using or testing out in the controls part?

29:39 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah.

29:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because that would be exactly those conflicts of interest sponsorship.

29:47 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah, I think this one can be helpful for us. And so we have already come to the interest. So we have come to the interest register.  and gives an hospitality register that actually spends quite a bit of time this fall streamlining and making it work properly.  But the other like them done a sponsorship in the nation's government is public officials is definitely relevant and that's an area where I will have to do some improvements in any case in Q1 so that's definitely something that I would be interested in trying out.

30:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  If you already have a conflict like some of those registers like would it if we were to use the same questionnaires and just put it in our system so that everybody has the same like one access not one access to that one access to that that could be a possibility too so that it's easier for employees to find but that could be something that we try to test out in January and I would like like to talk to you a little bit more about the third party risk management part because I feel like or even like like to gather your IDPs and stuff like to build something around that.  So here this is maybe a bit outside of the scope of this kind of pool but there's definitely a need

31:00 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  it for better management of these processes because so much of compliance is about getting some information from the business, reviewing it and providing guidance and then you never see it again or maybe see it again in few years or in a few years later.  so like being able to track the recommendations and the actions that you recommend, that would be incredibly helpful but it's probably quite complicated.  I don't think it's not too bad.

31:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like you could also build and that's kind of why we have like the most recent submissions and then you can kind of see and they could even like if you have questions like it doesn't need to go in your inbox it can go through here and then you can track the information or you can self-track the information there.

31:39 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  And I'm sorry I don't know if I want to say something but even just having a tool where you say okay these are the these are the third party entities that I've done an IDDO and this is like whether did you go did you go into a contractual relationship with a partner yes or no right so you can have it over and they can upload  the IDD that's not too complicated and still helpful out in like providing transparency and and sort of an audit trail of the work that has been done especially that like doing the IDDs you've done but that it did not lead to any business or that maybe because of the recommendation we decided not to be part of the business that would be very helpful and also something that the department of justice in the US expects you to have and that almost the company I know has in place.  Yeah, that's a good point.

32:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm sure you don't have it but it's a common flaw I think.

32:33 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  No, I agree with you.

32:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you want to go?

32:36 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Oh yeah, thank you.

32:38 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So Mari, you've mentioned that you spent quite a bit of time reworking a specific process. I think it was gifts and entertainment.  Yes, and conflicts of interest.

32:49 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  I actually had the training this morning on new updates of the required registrations and so it's very fresh. Okay, and so what was the thing?

33:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What prompted you to invest that much time in making that process better? What was wrong or maybe an ideal?

33:06 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  It wasn't registered, like we didn't have enough registries. That was, I think, the main problem. Yeah, people weren't using it or they tried.  then we had some errors in the system, like, for example, some of the automatic emailing didn't work so that no one would be notified if someone registered something in the system.  you like waited a month for the approval. Well, you know, like, so there were some just tweaks that needed to be done.  And I think awareness as well. But I wanted to, like, have system work and I wanted updating procedure and then awareness.  Got it. Thank you. Yeah.

33:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

33:47 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  OK, so I have a couple of closing questions, at least. Um, looking back at the initial conversations that you've had, even before we came on board and not.  that we came on board. I just wanted you to think retrospectively if you believe that the concept as we're presenting to you addresses your needs and challenges that you initially shared.  And the second part of that question is if you could change one thing about the software, what would it be?  Good question.

34:26 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  I'll start with the first one. So what I wanted to put into this, I guess, directly, but that when I would like to have is a tool that gives me a objective fact base for choosing my priorities this day or this week or this month rather than just jumping on whatever seems urgent in the organization in a way.  I think that the purpose of having that would be to make the work more actually risk-based. You know, because you can get a feeling that something is high risk or at least urgent, but it may not be the actual highest risk that you have at the moment.  And so this is the dashboard that you're showing now, I think, with the 165 conflicts of interest registrations. You have trained 471 people ethics.  Wow, we have a lot of hope line in 356. So yeah, it is something like this. I think this would be helpful.  I can also see that just based on the discussion we've had now for about half hour, that it is also something about, you know, you need to commit when you're going to use the new system and maybe we'd have to change a bit our procedures or change.  get rid of some other systems and go into a new system and that's a little bit painful, you know, when you build something to change direction.  But yes, this this overview and I think it is possible also to adjust like probably the numbers. see and like I think you showed me a lot of time that you could choose the book you want to see on the page.  That's the intention. Yeah, that's the intention. For us it would be relevant to look at the tutorials, for others I think geographies would be relevant to sort of look at.  If I could change one thing. Yeah, like I said, these two tools, third party management and risk assessment, very, very useful tools.  just would tweak them to be objective on the risk assessment with input on like objective facts. Let's find some time in December.  I want to like map out your process and I'm wondering if we can almost build this torture process and everyone else can benefit as part of this.

36:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think that could be good because this was like kind of my process, how I was in my head, but there isn't one way like you said, right?  And I think risk assessment in particular is an area where companies have very different approaches.

37:08 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah, exactly. So I'm trying to find out what is the right and simplified approach for that can be more scaled there.

37:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I do believe that some of these some of these processes is like you're saying like it's almost like you need to start with some of them and then slowly change your processes to match or to stay at just saying some of them because it's better than what you had before especially for companies that have sustainability or compliance officers.  But then ones that don't have anything are more likely okay I'll just take it all you know and but I think this is still at least a helpful tool even if it's only the controls part you know if only like another one then versus having nothing.

37:39 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So I think that's kind of the I think I also mentioned to you last time that this like the process of following up and IDD is also quite complex right like maybe the compliance officer would do I don't know a few IDDs every week at least and then so in a year maybe  to 300 IDDs and then you have doing one and three recommendations maybe for each one or maybe maybe some are just like fine and for some you would have a recommendation and then being able to track that is difficult.

38:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah maybe we could almost like yeah there is a box that I think is missing and our controllers around IDDs and PEPs and like kind of checks around that and so maybe we could discuss that Mari of creating a box within the control section around your IDD process like I like I would like to eventually test something out with you guys in January timeframe my feeling is maybe the controls at that IDD part you know if we can get those and those are working I feel like that would at least already add value to kind of the manual process that you have and then and then I think on a side note I think we can have another conversation about the third-party management and how to and risk management like how would it look like if you need to use it but it is yeah it is and like I would like to see  complicated your your process is because if you know if it's if it can like you know we can just change the wording of the process but the flow is still the same then you know that could be a possibility but if it's totally different then like we have to kind of see see that but um like if it's helpful I can share our IDD procedure with you.

39:17 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Oh yeah that would be super helpful because then we could try to just map that process out. Yeah I don't think we have a very complicated process actually it's just it's just more of a workflow than like if you have that like maybe Mao and Zhao can look at it we can kind of draw it out as part of the process and the controls that would be great yeah if you could send that to me then we can automate the process yeah okay cool actually because we have just done an annual review of all of our procedures and I'm probably getting approval on the updated version of the IDD procedure later today there's not big changes but I'll send you the that one so it won't be right away but by tomorrow you should get it.  That's perfect. Okay, cool.

40:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But do you think in January would that work as a time frame to like to see if you could like test this like actually like use it like in the kind of the gen.  Okay, great. Then I'll make a plan for that and like focusing on the controls aspect of it. Okay. All right, cool.

40:18 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Really, I have just one last question for me, more for the benefit of the one staying behind me and, you know, leaving the picture, looking forward, are there any capabilities or features of the software that you would be keen to see developed?  If you haven't really seen any indication of like so, there's so much you can do, right?

40:48 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So the question is more like, you know, where, where does the market take you? there's, so let's say you take this risk assessment, right?

40:56 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  That is fact based and it shows that these are the countries.

40:58 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  These are the projects that you have in construction phase. So that would be, that's very like operator mode. If your supplier would be different, but you could say, okay, this is maybe where you supply this kind of equipment with this kind of agent, for example, to expedite the country, like a product into a country.  you're on a supplier that could perhaps be one of your key risks. For us it's the construction phase. It's the permitting phase where you get permits to build something and any interaction with private officials, but also the the constructing of like, you know, buying solar panels from China and importing them to a high-risk country, maybe building, etc.  And so to sort of have that as a basis and see, okay, you have these many intermediaries, or in that country you have joint venture partners that do work for you on your behalf, like what kind of controls do you have in place, and be able to track all of this like at the same time, would be one way to extend it.  And another way, which is something I think about all the time, like, all this, so one thing is the IDPs and the recommendations you make there, but you also have like ad hoc recommendations, you have risk committee meetings, you have board meetings, and you have management meetings, and you have audits, and you have reviews, that all of these generate follow up actions, right?  And they can't all be handled by compliance, need to allocate them somewhere.

42:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And this again will like affect your risk picture.

42:34 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  And to have a way to track all of this would also be very helpful. And I think that's in our plan, at least for them.

42:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We have a management box and a reporting box that you can store the information and then add tasks of requirements that come from it.

42:48 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  So I think that could be like one aspect for it along with the audit trail for that.

42:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I definitely will come back to you when we start developing those boxes that are not there. But I think I overheard just like, yes.  kind of like a task management tool for all the different things. even for incoming submission, she's here on the bottom right, it could be like, okay, you could also, I did this in my previous company, you could also submit on your own and be like, I need to follow up on this and like, you know, it and so that you're able to do that.  So I know I hear you there. So I think we will at least build that part, those parts of it.  it's coming. yeah.

43:24 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Cool. Good.

43:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  At this point, I think you might need to round it off.

43:30 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  At from my side. Yeah. Thank you so much for your help, Mari.

43:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, you're It's been very insightful, I So I think that just the follow up is like, it's going to be me, Xiao, Mao and the team, the Brazilian team coming back.  So we'll probably set up another meeting with you in like, probably maybe one more before Christmas, just to like kind of maybe ask questions or show anything.  I might reach out to you directly, just have a meeting on third party management and risk management to see if  figure out like what your flow could look like if we were to automate it because I would like to have that just on the back of my mind as I'm of building this.  But yeah and then like kind of having the plan is like some kind of January hopefully you know fingers crossed that the controls part will be ready it should be ready by you know January so then we can see if we can actually test it out in the system along with the process.

44:20 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah, if it's February it's like that's fine.

44:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  January and February is obviously very busy in terms of reporting we need to prepare the annual report on the experience act report and I think so like February and March is also a good month for instance.  Okay good then we don't have to know that's good. Okay yeah then that then that that we might plan for that then just so we're not pushing everything right in the beginning because we have some other pilots too then we can kind of plan around that but I'll put for like February March there.  yeah well it's fun talking to you and it's nice to see that the pilot is developing.

44:55 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Yeah but thank you for your time.

44:58 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yes okay well we'll touch with the next

45:00 - Mari Elise Engh Brekke (Aker Horizons)
  Thank you. Thank you.

45:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Bye.

45:03 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Bye, bye, bye.
