0:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I should write the glasses maybe that's it Well, I can show you the real one, but it's not very pretty The movie is eternal I never finished moving Like me I can show you that honest if the table over there Okay, how are you?  How was your weekend amazing good movie for work? That's always just always good always working with new revelations Did you change your camera?  your image is better No, are you in a different either location? Perhaps a man.

0:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, I mean the same network. don't know.

0:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it looks more detailed now I don't know Good Yes.

1:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, any any news from my side? I've been working with the frameworks and I like them.  I like them. It's it's it's really good and And I send you also with But I think a message about how it's interesting to once you have like it's Like I have my soccer field right now, you know, and now I can play inside the soccer field Maybe I can do some changes, but I know what's my soccer field, you know, and that's how a framework feels like, you know, like I know How to play what to change but inside of certain limits.  So that's why I love about the frameworks and also about the the design of the human things I like that and Also the last one of the boat.  It was pretty interesting. But while I was working with that, I sent you an email about also know what I find interesting to keep working together it's the developing of like kind of the canvas right the canvas you know and you sent me the the alex business model canvas investigation did you do that or did you find that okay I found it really interesting and how granular you went to and yes there I know there's going to be lots of iteration but also I don't want to be ecstatic I found that maybe the business model canvas it's a bit static I know in a way you can go back and you can leave it like that and you can change things and it's going to evolve but I think the thing that I want to do it's in those canvas is like make it in cycle you know like you need to come back every every month to see if things are changing or to see where you're going and and it's it's a good framework the business model canvas I've been working into  Different psychedelic canvas, but I think it's a good start to create my own like there's a canvas or workshop design canvas and expansive sign canvas and things like that that could help me a lot and I discover a website called psychedelics design that it's how psychedelics can influence design and how this can influence psychedelics is part principle, something like that.  So there's people already doing this kind of work and they have in the partner, this, I think it's called jail and he's the partner of Mackenzie design, top executive, so it's interesting how people are interested in developing new design methodologies, you know, so I'm not lost.  I think there's big people trying to do this, I think I'm a small and doing this, it means that a, if the big people are looking into it, there's some gold.  you know like I need to explore more uh yeah the psychedelic design school right no there's a new one it's called psychedelics dot design let me find it and I'm showing okay okay okay so I thought it was the same thing but I see it's not you get it uh I sent it to you and if you look to the about section there's uh this also they're trying to do kind of the same not the same as me but they're trying to do like uh premium training you know like in design thinking and things like that so what I'm aiming it's you know at the end it's great my own curriculum between for mindset design thinking for processes it's innovation for insights and principles it's psychedelics you know and that's why I want the frameworks and the the campuses but they have like really interesting people in their advisory strategy  That's what you can buy for it, but that means something for me, know, like you're exploring this, absolutely, absolutely.

5:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you?

5:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let me just take the time, take the time and just switch.

5:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think what comes to mind is great. So if a lot more people are looking into this, and man, if they have a McKinsey dude on that, it's certainly going mainstream.  So that's good. They also have, it's cool, right? The style is cool, it's coherent, have interesting branding and so on.  So that's also, it tells me that there's some money behind investments and stuff like that and I can see how this talks to the thing you're doing.

6:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Those are the things I like.

6:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean the market is moving in a direction that you are also seeing and you're moving that direction so that's good and now what I'm thinking is is there a way or maybe I don't know if you're interested in that of you know surfing a wave that they might be creating like getting to their wave I don't know yeah because the thing is I mean you have your thing and you don't need them right you have your thing but when people get together and start putting this stuff together and they have like their own like

7:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  networks of people they went to college to and North American financing and so they generate a certain wave in the in the sea that and I'm like would it make sense I don't know honestly would it make sense for you to be adjacent to that like to talk to be a speaker at a conference or that they organize no stuff like this I already contact her you know I'll explain like how it's great to found you and I'm being working and researching about the innovation processes with the same thinking and psychedelics and I see that you're doing this so I'm really inspired for what you do until then let's if you have time connect share ideas and let's see what comes up because it's okay to join forces because what I see it's it's just her by herself but she's like a senior designer so he had work like with nice body files so she just get into psychedelic she's a new in psychedelics but she has the design back  So, it's just, she did all the branding by herself, all the project by herself, no team or anything, but she has lots of connections, you know, and if you see the support network, it's like the big leaders in the psychedelics space.  I don't know how she did it, maybe she's friends with friends of them, but she was not interested in psychedelics, but she's getting along with some interesting people.  Yeah, that's very interesting, but in a good way, for me it's like, okay, I feel with her we're kind of pioneers in mixing this antique innovation and things like that in psychedelics, but in a way it serves me because people are going to take a look at what's that, you know, and they are they're only  level in English speaking. So I'm going to be the only one in Spanish speaking. So in a way, it serves me, you know, like, we need people to look at that, to look at psychedelics with the design and innovation lessons, because that helps me, you know, and if she's creating a movement into it, I think it's good, you know, like, maybe join forces so they can turn around and look at me, but not working for them, you know, in a way.  So it's just right in the way with them. So let's see how it goes. Yeah. It's really interesting.

9:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And okay, so it's funny you've mentioned the canvas thing that you wanted the thing that's more dynamic. Because when you first spoke to me, like we didn't meet yet, you just sent me a message, right?

9:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I went looking for your stuff.

9:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think I've made a note about Yeah, yeah. Maybe this is a note I have. Maybe there's something in the physical product space for a diary, right?  And I'm sure this has crossed your mind. This connection between like, is a mind tool, like a canvas, but it's also like a routine thing, like a diary or an application, and it's related to change, which is, of course, something you care about.  So it occurred to me that back then that maybe this is something that makes sense for you.

10:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  are your thoughts on this? Like doing a diary? The journal?

10:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't know if maybe it's a diary, okay, but maybe something else. Let me see if I open something here.

10:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Look, I'm gonna send you another one that it's called FoldTrips that I've been thinking something about. like this it's like psychedelic it's like uh it's like kind of uh it's not you know a worship you do with me it's a like kind of a mini workshop you can do by yourself that it brings the itinerary what to do like what are the tools that you have in mind how to play with it so while you are doing microdosing you know to explore yourself to explore sensuality to explore creativity maybe I want to get into sensuality all of the all of the things but maybe create you know I've been following a lot of consulting agencies visual consulting I think you have heard of the growth of tools or visual consultants or explain you know like they have their cars or they have their canvases the templates or maybe they they don't they just have that like they've great they have the visual frameworks in cars so at the end you know what I'm developing while we talk like we were working together because you know like  It seems that every time I'm evolving in what I'm doing. So I was thinking, you know, like what I'm Feeling let me give you what I'm doing right now.  So it's kind of what I'm doing it revolves around Let me find this Okay I don't find Okay, but what I'm trying to say it's kind of my My way of doing things in in how can I bridge psychedelics Design thinking in a patient visual thinking facilitation and visualization.  There are my like What I'm trying to bring it together, you know, because in a way psychedelics gives you insights, you know I want to escape the  Besides it gives you insight and it has really cool principles, you know, there's a good neuroscience that can Potentialize lots of things we could talk about neuroplasticity we could talk about the turn off of the mod The Falmouth network yet that you can go beyond your own way of thinking and also we couldn't talk about the principles about empathy Interconnectedness about consciousness expansion, but then the same thinking it's about the mindset and Not just about the methodology.  It's about, you know, how to approach things with iteration How to embrace uncertainty and things like that So I want to break design thinking not all of the design thinking just about the mindset training I found it really really useful and then the innovation what about the innovation that innovation?  It's about process and it's about not just a problem-solving methodology that could be design thinking But it's about creating new value  any new value for yourself, creating new value to develop ideas, products, services or processes for your company or for yourself.  know, we see processes are habits. So in a way, that's where innovation comes in. It's to create value, not just design for design.  And then what I love about visual thinking or drawing is that I found this girl called Patti Droboloz is something like that.  That is, I also send me a message. Yeah. And also, someone recommend me out of nowhere, someone called the pop of pitch, it's called Dan Rome, that he is how to you pitch.  It's like, he has a book called the back of the napkin, you know, the big businesses are a number.  It's about just drawing an idea. And the idea of visual thinking, it's, you know, drawing, it creates also sort of turning in and creates oxytocin.  So you can get engaged with what you see. And that's what psychedelics is. powerful because you see things and we always are decoding things through visual it's maybe 80% of our time we're visual visualizing things so we believe what we see and if I see my conditions that are poor I believe that I'm poor so drawing it takes you out of what your mind it's telling you so visual thinking comes as the translator you know and I want to give people you know like if we have the deck cards of like they've great visual frameworks people are going people could translate their abstract ideas into frameworks you know so I'm helping them translate the insights and then facilitation it's about facilitating all the process through a workshop when then at the end they will come out with a visualization of their own insights and about the future self so I'm trying to mix all of these ideas and with all of these ideas I think there could be a new line of product so like I'm having my own deck cards  of having my car so how to work together and innovate and an idea of giving them like this kind of journal but not journal maybe kind of a posture or how they can draw or design through their psychedelic but in a different you know just drawing a mandala or spiritual team more about the professional aspect you know I don't know if you get my idea no I do I do I do because it's a very coherent I mean it makes all the sense given that we've talked so far there's so many things in my head so first one I think that a physical product could

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  very interesting. Maybe it's logistically more complex than I would not start with that.

17:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know, have you done like physical stuff before, sent for production? No, but I don't think it's like, I have the context if I want to do cars or something like that that I know.

17:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because what I mean is more like the operation of selling that my wife she has like physical products like cards.  And I'm sure there's better ways of doing this. She's not super professional about that. But it's something that you need to keep a stock and it's in your house and you need to send people and maybe depending on the country there's like customs and stuff like that that we need to pay for taxes and stuff like that.

17:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So my point is this is not encourage you from physical products is just that because you have so many ideas and so many possibilities you have the luxury of not having to start with physical products but you could you could do that uh so that's something that maybe I want to leave it just to do my uh in person workshops you know like I'm planning also you know like maybe you don't want to do digital but I can go to Mexico City travel there and just uh 10 people gather it and so they can be like hey you know just to uh sparkle uh you know in a way curiosity so people are like like what what is he giving out you know like they they I want to give them like a full heat you know like full kid of of things with cars with uh with everything that they need you know but to give them an experience for for in person workshops yeah I think that's very cool sorry not  Also, I think I want to show, well, in a bit, I don't know if it's necessary to show my screen, but it's just so you can also imagine what I'm trying to show, let me show you.  Do you see my camera?

19:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, now I see your screen, yes.

19:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so in a way, this is what I told you that this is the mix, right? psychedelics, design thinking, innovation, visual thinking, facilitation and visualization.  The difference between visual thinking and visualization is that visual thinking is more, drawing and visualization is about having the big poster or the big screen in front of you.  Like you said, I know you're in consulting services and you see a lot of businesses are asking for people to draw their mission statements.  everyone is aligned so that's why they need to visualize it you know visual thinking maybe the process visualizing it's having it like a big dashboard so they can be all aligned so that's why it's how I can align manage like change management because at the end I want to facilitate more effective change right so the ecosystem it's my kind of way of working it's the pillars of unified leadership in a way it's innovation design thinking psychedelic transformation visual thinking facilitation and visualization so at the at the in a way the ecosystem has different functions or components it's the catalyst phase you know we're used for insight the framing phase that were design thinking comes into place the ideation phase where innovation comes in place the implementation phase where also between innovation and visual thinking comes into place and the integration phase you know so I'm trying to  code and create a new curriculum with all of these things. Each phase unlocks different aspects you know and each kind of at the end I also don't want to just give you an experience but teach you abilities you know it's not about turning off the car it's about learning how to drive the car or learning where you want to go so I was thinking you know and while researching the grade you know like I need to create a cycle of the different components you know to create a momentum you know and how each part of my methodology it serves to another bigger purpose you know so I was thinking about these kind of cycles but at the end it's a new operating system you know that it could be essential for individuals for teams or organizations you know so also this is this could be another way of exploring the visual ecosystem you know in the center is psychedelics it is the one that unlocks the rock  Potential then you need to facilitate how the energy is going to flow then secondary perhaps it's visual thinking how you translate things that then deterring it's design thinking the methodology the structure to test iterate and and everything else in innovation.  It's what makes impact, you know, at the end visualization or vision is what's outside, but we want to push the envelope.  So that's what I've been working on, know, like, I think I evolved for where we were doing, you know, because at the end we were just like with the framers explaining the difference between the clinical aspects and, and, and, you know, how we approach this psychedelic.  A companion, but this gave me the tools to think more freely and and be, you know, what I was looking for.  So, in a way, I think their success of where we were, we were.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  doing because it gives it gave me the the wings to fly you know got it got it is so i mean you know me by now so you know when i'm looking down i'm making notes and thinking like how do i make sense of this because i think we have a similar way of thinking about this stuff okay so i'll just repeat back to you what i've heard and you let me know this is in line we started working together to figure out like frameworks and i also i think there was a huge leap of faith on your side like you were i don't think you were absolutely 100 sure of what would come out of our process together but you wanted to see so that that was amazing for me so we did that and at the end we have these different frameworks that talk more about a part of your thinking there's a part of your thinking that the

24:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  frameworks are more detailed about.

24:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And when you see the frameworks, OK, OK, OK, framework in context, when you see the frameworks, OK, I need to get back to this.  When you see the frameworks, this allows you to put into paper multiple ideas you had in your mind, and you're like, oh, OK, now they are like legals.

24:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I can hold them and pick them together, and I can see all the components.

24:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can look at them from different sides, right? So by doing the framework thing, you're thinking about your work changed.

24:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe it evolved.

24:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It went more into the creative aspect, right? Which was already there, but it's just a new direction. is it actually putting more energy into the creative aspect, the creative power of innovations, psychedelics, and so on?  OK. With this in mind, you are exploring this stuff because you move quickly. and you don't sit with questions for too long.

25:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I've noticed that, it's really interesting. Like if you have a question, you'll figure it out quickly.

25:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you go and you ask people and you've asked chat TPD and you read books and find stuff. And this evolves and you've come to this place where you see, okay, so there's people and organizations packaging psychedelics and creativity in business friendly ways, ways that businesses could use and make, you know, I mean, there's a new thing happening.  It's becoming a bit more accepted in the mainstream or in the corporate world and so on and so forth.  So I know this, you know, all of this stuff and you also have a very personal perspective and you are creative and you keep thinking like, what can I do with my own personal perspective on this?

26:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  which is proven to be pretty accurate, because I'm not alone saying this. There's a lot of smart people saying the same things I'm saying, which this gave you confidence, right?

26:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you're like, okay, so this is the timing. I'm not a good time.

26:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  need to make use of this time.

26:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you're thinking like about products and canvas and frameworks and things that people can associate with you with Jorge, right?

26:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So far, did I get it correctly?

26:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I understand you?

26:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, everything is correct. yes, not just confidence of what more smart people are doing, because you see someone doing it.  Because at the end, it's also like a collective need that it's surging, and I want to be on the front.  It's not that there's big companies right there. It's a collective search that it's an energy that people are starting to see the patterns.  And the smart people are noticing. And also, just to add at the beginning of what you said and when I say the framework mechanics, when I get with you, I didn't like, I barely started to know what it was, but instead of, you know, reading lots about framework.  I contacted you because you were the one that inspired me to learn more about this and how you project things.  And with this first exercise is like learning the basics of how framework thinking works. And in a way, it helped me organize one layer of my work, the therapeutic aspect, but because I was lost inside of that.  So you free me to think to a new creative layer because I have organized my thoughts and organize my ideas about the therapeutic aspect.  You know, so we put it into blocks that I cannot, I cannot, it's okay to not keep it in my mind, you know, like now I have the framework.  So my mind is free. you know and that helped me a lot to explore new iterations of my work and I'm also because I'm seeing that the design thinking also helped me a lot to to be iterative in the way of thinking.  I know all not all of the ideas that I have my work but I'm also lining in with the innovation aspect of what I really want my life to look like how I want to work like designing my work designing how I want to work designing how many times I want to work you know this also comes in mind the life design aspect into it so that's why I'm exploring ideas that are coherent to my life design that's why.

28:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No absolutely absolutely and again I mean this is also something that makes sense to me like on a personal level me going to Portugal last week was only possible because I've kind of organized my life in that way right so yeah.

29:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I fully fully see your your thing um okay I'm thinking about of some ideas of how you can help me that it's first uh it's we can work into the or workshop or the framework thinking again but I think it's more about uh organizing kind of this methodology or like because I I know which curriculum like the content that I want to share but with you maybe organizing that people are attracted to it you know like how can I explain or how can I show them the value of this you know maybe you are good at at also this because when I read your post you know how to to speak to the pain point of the pain point and frustration of the of the person you know that's how I contacted you so maybe you could help me like also organize  better this also because you're a designer and you know like maybe lots of frustration and because you're also a consultant you know maybe you can help me lots in that aspect as well.

30:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah I mean that's kind of work I love doing and so let me see it's funny that we are you know kind of building this together the briefing together so there's one aspect that is about organizing the methodology right and connecting different parts and new references and you know just bringing it into a cohesive and easy to communicate thing that people see oh I see what Jorge is doing right so there's that aspect there are different ways of doing that thing right so now we discuss  that's the what. The what thing is this, organizing the methodology. And now there's different ways, different hows of how we could do that.  So one way is we do these sort of sessions where we work together through things and they're a little bit organic and we figure out oh now we're thinking about this now.  That's one way that's perhaps less structured. There's another way which is I think more structured, which is maybe think about sprints.

31:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We figure out okay, there's one thing that is really important for Jorge to do in the next month or two months.

31:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we know that other things will appear because we are creative, new ideas will appear, you'll keep on reading new stuff, new ideas will appear that is guaranteed.

32:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But we work together on a sprints, like with the beginning, with the end, to develop one thing, right?

32:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One thing that at the end it's done. It's like, it's here, it's ready, right? This thing could be many different things, right?  So let me see if I can make it, I don't have the pen here with the iPad, let me just set.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, on. I don't want to lose the spark that came to my mind now, so I want to move fast.  I'll send you the link to the mirror and I'll make a quick draft on it, right? Okay, so ongoing.  Spring-based. Tell me when you enter the middle, please.

33:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It says password. I think it's Jorge.

33:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's the same password as before. Jorge, Jorge.

33:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, Jorge, Jorge.

33:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I see that you're in.

33:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm bringing you to me.

33:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So what to do? We have maybe organize the methodology. And we have another thing which would be like developed products like physical or canvas or.  Right. way of working is one of these two options, right? Is this making sense? Do you agree with this?  Okay. So based on what you told me, the most specific and predictable way for us to do stuff would be this thing.  We develop a product on a sprint. This is more predictable.

34:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Still, there's room for like, oh, what's going to happen and so on, but it's more predictable.

34:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one is the least predictable, organized methodology ongoing.

34:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This is a little bit more like creative coaching for a long time, right?

34:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then we can do mix this stuff. So if we try to organize the methodology in a sprint ways, it's kind of  F.

35:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And if you try to develop a product ongoing, it's a little bit more bounded. So depending on your objectives, one of these things or other things would make more sense.

35:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think we need to discuss a bit more like what's your ultimate objectives to see what makes the most sense to you.  Like for the more proximal objectives, near term.

35:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, now I'm showing you my screen again so you can see what I have done about the kind of my roadmap.  Do you see my screen? I see your screen, yes.

35:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, so at the end, it's a product roadmap.

35:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I want to finish my, at the end of the program, it's a six-weeks cohort-based training. You know, and inside this training we could do lots of things, you know, like it's weak.  It's about framing the methodology. It's about developing the workshop. It's about creating a physical product or a welcome key that comes with it.  But at the end, I need help like because I do this by myself. I need someone to get feedback to help me, know, like this could work.  This doesn't work. Maybe you could do this. And I have a notion where I have all my ideas, you know, the same canvas, the phases of the process, the different things that I want to show.  But I don't have anyone for feedback. And I don't want you to decide by myself, you know, so that's why I love how you work.  I love your creative mind. So having you, it will give me confidence to say, OK, this is work. This doesn't work.  And at the end, you know, like also this is I'm doing this in different days, you know, like I need to develop my pricing, my six week program.  Outline prototype a clear offering and the methodology, you know, how are we're going to show in the landing page the methodology the content material?  It's part of me But at the end I I want to feel confident in in the outline in the framework and design canvases in the workshop design You know make it very intentional.  Like what are we going to do? What are the activities? You know, like all of these things I think you're you're more expert than me, you know I'm barely getting in touch in in worship and I'm very intuitive and and I can develop things but You are the one that how that that I know you could help me a lot And you know at the end I also want to provide frameworks templates and like recipes, you know, so they So my my kind of psychedelic innovation consulting firm is about giving not just the mindset the methods through the workshop, but also the tools and the tools could be templates could be frameworks could be things like that that that it goes  Because with them, know, as the visual thinking part of the visualization part, you know, so I, you know, I don't know if that makes it more clear for you.  No, it does make more clear for me.

38:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, here, this is what I'm thinking. And let me know if this makes sense, if you agree or disagree.  On a very personal note, I usually feel self-conscious when my work is too vague, because I assume that people might think that I'm trying to hide or not do the thing, you know, so I make an effort to try sometimes to be super specific.  if you go, this is the thing we'll do and so on and forth. And you can see that in the way I talk, oh, this, like, spring.  vibe I am getting from you, and I'd love you to correct me if I'm wrong, is that you know that this sort of work is not super specific.  And sometimes it needs a little component of exploration or just leaving things a bit undefined and then you figure out something and then you define the thing.  So it seems to me that you are more comfortable with this idea of look, John, I know that the work is not a science, that there's a bit of art.  If this is true, you accept that side of the work we do together, it becomes easier for me to think about or instead of super-defined thing, it becomes easier for me to think about a more open-ended but still directed, not just freestyle, it's still directed, right?  So did I understand correctly?

39:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Are you more comfortable with this than most clients are? Why most clients?

39:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think most of my, maybe it is an issue with my own client acquisition. But I think a lot of my clients, they're open, but they're not as open as you are.

40:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You are very open, right? Okay, yes.

40:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very open. So because of that, I usually try to make them feel more comfortable. I say, oh, at the end you'll get this canvas with this worksheet and this formula, like really specific.  And for the work we're talking about here right now, it's difficult to do that, to specify exactly what we'll have at the end, right?  And I get a little bit uncomfortable with that because I don't want you to feel that I'm talking .  But I sense from you that you don't think I'm talking . You just accept that this kind of work is a bit like this.

40:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's creative. It's art and science.

40:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So given that maybe what makes the most sense is you and I define some sort of... recurring conversation that happens every now and then we define this I don't know and in those conversations we look we're always looking for opportunities to level up things in a way that allows you to advance with your plans so what we do not want is we keep talking about new ideas because I think you have new ideas enough new ideas that's not that's not a challenge I don't have a problem with ideas exactly right so I think that if we keep it a little bit open like like a creative coaching sort of thing like we're doing together and learning together if we do that we need to be very attentive to we want to get somewhere we want Jorge to have something to show for this like I don't want to have like fascinating conversations with you that are amazing I love them but at the end I'm like I don't know  was helpful. This was just nice, right? So the model of work that I'm thinking, and this is a conversation, you can help me figure this out, the model of work that I'm thinking is like, we can have recurring conversations every now and then, with a specific period of this city, and during those conversations, we look for things we can unlock or unblock for you to advance faster in the things you're doing.

42:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And sometimes, sometimes this could mean, know what, Joanne?

42:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you tell to me, I need help with this aspect, and I think you can help me with this aspect.  And we do that, we spend our time together working on that aspect. And some other times you say, I know this other thing, this branding thing, but you, Joanne, are not the person to do it.  I just want your help to create a briefing so I can send the branding guys.

42:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  know, it could be something like this.

42:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How does it feel to you? I like it.

43:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's okay for me to have this ongoing conversation. also at the end, because of your last name, land, landado, it's about landing, landing my ideas, you know, I need to land my ideas, because I have like, it's not noise, it's just creative impulses, you know, like, lots of potential niche markets and lots of potential ideas and how I can cross it over.  So maybe I lose time about ambition and what could work. But at the end, I'm getting stopped by actually what's going to happen, you know, because at the end, a plan wants to revive their first contact with reality.  But I know my work. It's interesting. I know people love them. I just want them, I just want to get to the right people, to the right frustration and create the right product.  But at the end, the essence, I want to teach, you know, I want to teach. I want to show a new way of doing things.  That's what I want to to do with people. I feel that the best way to do it It's the six week cohort program.  I feel it. I I I know it It's because it's good for me. It's good money for me and it's really nice really Intentional and there's some people that they have so much time In life with responsibilities and cannot put like two months three months four months into training so six weeks, I think it's perfect and I just need to decide and Go ahead with my first prototype.  So at the end I think the first conversation is just about Jorge it's fun to talk about lots of ideas and all of them are  amazing, you know, they're nice, but If you need to decide now to work with just one because  You don't have any money and tomorrow you need to start your wait list and start to launch it Which one do you choose?  know, so I need someone like pushing me to okay now So this is something that I also will also for you, you know, like Push me just do this and try this and we'll see we listen to the market We get the feedback But do do one thing and do it now, you know, doesn't need to be perfect I try it out launch it and let's see how things go But when I launched it, I want to have all the things good, you know the landing page and everything but Because I don't decide on which one to start.  That's how I don't decide What I need to do first is a framework of the world show the landing because I have so many ideas already with me You know, I need help deciding No, I'm very glad you said that Because I think I think that's how I can be most useful

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  context. I think I'm creative enough to understand how your mind works, but I'm also square or boring enough to help you bring back to the little life.  I'm happy to say that. Of all the things you have right now, like you have on your plate, right?  Do you have like hard deadlines on any of them? something that involves buying a ticket, an airplane ticket or stuff like that?

46:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like something that I need to finish it now? Yeah. That's the thing, that's why I don't decide because I don't have the line here, but I want to launch end of February.  I want to start the program. February 27th, and I need to launch maybe on January, you know, so I can give two months, two months piece of of deciding.  Cool.

47:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is good. So the thing that is most ahead of you is the six week program, right?

47:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, okay, I have my deadlines. Okay, so are you sharing the screen? don't think I want to share the screen.  Do you see my screen? Yes, now I do.

47:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So right now I have the branding thing.

47:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The branding girls are doing the work and they're going to delivery to the end of December. But I want to decide maybe these things to advance that it's pricing the six week program outline.  you're offering a methodology prototype like how I'm going to do this you know the the actual part I want to finish it by December the second because on December 3rd I'm going to Costa Rica to do our retreat and I come back to the 16th so once we have this like when I mean content material it's the basics of the content with this we can start developing the just the writing into images like like do the visual thinking for the presentation you know like that's where framework canvas and designs come in December also with the workshop design program because this is the content like the pre-recorded videos that they're going to have like the theory but here is the practical workshop that they're going to have so the six-week program is divided in practical and theory so the theory is pre-recorded content and the practice is three hours or four hours workshop with the group you know and it's all limited  to 12 people so also when we have this design at the end when we finish the workshop it's about the welcome kid what do i want them to have you know like maybe uh some cards of the frameworks or maybe some some journal or something you know but something pretty small but significant you know like they can see oh wow this is interesting that it's it's something added to their to their to pricing you know and just that that's it the other things that i i need to do it's more technical so it's about creating my circle community and the second brand the second phase of the branding that it's uh actually the welcome kid the design of the presentations the my cards and all of those and when they're finished they're going to start with the landing page but for us you know as with me and you i think this is the most important the outline of the of the work and the framework of the presentation  And all of that, you know, like now with my new kind of methodology, developing those frames, I don't know if it's good two weeks for frameworks, maybe more.  But this is like how I see things, you know, you can correct me, you have more experience. But this is just an idea.  Cool. Now this is good.

50:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  is good. What I'm thinking is, what I'm thinking is, it seems to me that you're, this is launch, you want it to be really polished, right?

50:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Good design, really, you know, good branding and so on and so forth.

50:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I would challenge you, and if we keep on talking for more sessions, I will do this constantly. I will challenge you on what things you don't need right now.  Okay.

50:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

50:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I say this from the position of somebody that's often over-designed stuff, right? the price, can you bring it back again?

51:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I took a screenshot, but.

51:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let me see.

51:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So the pricing, I think it makes all the sense.

51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The outline, of course, makes sense.

51:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know, and this is, this is not an euphemism.

51:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I honestly do not know if you need the welcome kit for now. I know why you want one, because that's cool.

51:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe for the next cover, would be this, okay, let's take that out. Or just, I'm gonna put it at the end.

51:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so actually, I think one thing that could be useful is, is this. The program you're creating is a product, right?  Yes. like, yeah, it's a product. And like every product, like a software product, like every sort of product, you have versions of it.  And it's okay. If you know that you will redo some parts of it, it's much easier for us to say I will not do this thing right now, but I will do it later.  What's difficult sometimes is when we say, oh, you know what, I really want to do something with virtual reality.  I think that's cool.

52:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think that's future.

52:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to do something with that. If you don't have like a roadmap of the future of your product, you have no place to put that idea.  You don't know where to put that idea and you are afraid of forgetting about that idea. So I try to put everything in the first version.  When you start thinking about multiple versions, it's much easier for you to say, you know what, I would like to have something with augmented reality.  But I can do that six months from now because I'll use this roadmap, I'll do the first version, and then I'll see what's left to do.

52:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I think that's

53:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A core aspect of how I think about these things is to think about like now, next, later, different horizons, and the different horizons make it much easier to prioritize.  And if you prioritize, you have a lot of to do, it's easier to launch, and so on. So that's something I would do together with you to help you prioritize this.  And also to force you, maybe force is a strong word, but to really be annoying and say, this could be simpler, you know, because I'm going to give you an example.

53:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm going to give you an example.

53:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I hired a designer to do my branding, right, for a mesocyclist. It was a fascinating process. She really understood my mind and how I work.  She was really good. And at the end, the design, because I'm a designer, I'm picky about this stuff.

53:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  At the end, I was like,

54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, I like the thinking, but I'm not sure if this is the actual design.

54:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And then I didn't use like 90% of it.

54:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I used almost nothing of what you sent me. And because I kept thinking, I want my workshop thing to be very distinctive, very cool, very smart, very clever, you know, all these things.  And this was holding me back because I'm working alone like you.

54:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I was like, oh, this is not ready.

54:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is not ready to see the world. A friend of mine told me, you need to write more stuff on your newsletter.  And I started writing more stuff on newsletter. And that's how he found me.

54:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because I had in my mind this thing like, oh, I need to come out of the gate, really  cool and look expensive and so on.

54:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I was not doing it because I was just felt overwhelmed. So one of the things I usually insist on is like, when we think about this in phases.  So if we don't do this today, we can do it tomorrow when we don't still scared of losing this great idea.  And the other thing is, can we go really dumb, like Times New Roman black text on a white background?

55:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because for a lot of clients, this is enough.

55:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is, these are two ways I usually think about this stuff, for myself as well.

55:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, I get it. Totally. And everything that I've been doing, it's been like that, if they're actually simple, you know, like, and, you know, what I'm changing things because I think I can give more value.  Sometimes I think that I'm not giving the most value that I can, you know, and thinking about the experience of the people.  That's why everything it's been really, really simple. And just, you know, when I do the curriculum, I just do a gamma presentation with AI super easy and meet talking with Loom.  So the functionality it's there, know, like, I've been doing that, you know, prototyping and always doing different career. glooms and just seeing like what gives more impact I already have data so that's why right now I want to to push my limits and create something just a little bit more a step in a way and and that people see the design because at the end I'm pushing design so that's why they need to see this thing they just don't need to see functionality you know because functionality I haven't you know like I could just say right now like I'm opening this course in my Instagram and who's interested you know put your data and you know I will show you I know I can do this it's simple for me I can do iterations fast in that way but I now I want to change the standards of my iterations you know so yes I think the welcome kid could be later on and I also think that a maybe a well-designed experience because you know right now I explain and they have all of these and these oh my god it's but at the end it's not necessary you know  It's it's too much. Do you see my my screen right? I see your screen.

57:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

57:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So it's not necessary I'm doing the Australia activation worship actually to see like how they do things and and you know They they have this ambition and discover, you know Kind of the same as what I was trying to tell, you know, like with these icons and maybe more about instead of flight airplane maybe about Space exploration, they have these summits and they have the compass and things like that But I once I'm interaction in this I think I think this is this is too much.  It's complex It's I prefer something simpler than me. I'm doing a workshop right now and I'm doing these simplicity things, you know Like already with some templates Okay, I don't know why it's not connecting What I'm doing some templates thing that it's functional and it's not necessary, you know, like I'm doing  kind of this and it looks nice you know with design I don't need this to be a complex design I just need to be nice you know to feel nice be nice I love simplicity but I want something that it's really well done right so with that you know you see this it's too complex it's too much it's not necessary right but when I go back here what what I was thinking the most two important things maybe it's just having my curriculum you know what I want to teach because also that could help in the offering and having my landing page and start my email marketing and just the branding and design of the of the product maybe that's those three things could be the things that I need the most you know maybe they've also the framework design canvas it's an extra it's not actually super necessary when I do the workshop also in the curriculum it's the same theory and workshop  Maybe while I'm doing the workshop, I can develop just some ideas of framework. But for me, it's something extra that most of the people won't do, having the visual thinking aspect.  So that's why I want to put the framework. It's something that could differentiate me in a way if I put it.  Yeah, I see it.

59:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  see it. I see your point.

59:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I want to take more of your time. let me know, what do you think? How can we start working together when and what do you say?

59:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I think my suggestion is...

59:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'll put all the details in the email.

59:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  if we were to set another call, like a working call, not just a briefing call, because I know you want to move fast.  If we want to do a fast call, I think my focus on that call would be going over with you, backlog, your roadmap, figuring out what are the things that are most relevant and where we can like advance the most and then create action plans for those.  There's a book. Maybe you have it, because you are very quick, let me get it for you. 100 million offers, thanks for watching.

1:00:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You have it, of course, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really good, right?

1:00:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love it. It's so, there's not a lot of fat, there's a lot of value in the book. What made me think about this is when you said that you're not sure you're giving all the value.  That's how the light bulb would hit my mind, because... I suspect that you are giving enough value, right? And the tricky bit is not to just add more things, it's just to have very specific things, right?  And I think there's something in there that we could do together. For instance, I'm going to give you a silly example, okay?

1:01:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This is not a great example.

1:01:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But imagine that you realize that for your customers, your clients, the hardest thing is to, when they go back to their daily lives, the hardest thing is to remember that they went through this experience with you.  And they know they have, but they forget during the day, right? And maybe the only thing you need to give them that will already multiply the value is like a chain for the keys, right?

1:01:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It may be that stuff, because every time they pull up, their keys are like, oh, yeah, I did this thing, you know, of course, it would be like a nice chain, of course.  But that's my point.

1:02:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe there's things you can do that are simple, but they really increase the value in nonlinear ways.

1:02:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's how I started thinking about this because you said that.

1:02:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but yeah, but that's it. Okay, so I love that about the key chains.

1:02:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I never thought about it, you know, because at the end, they want this experience to feel real. It's like you have used in the movie Inception.

1:02:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, exactly. That's a great example. That's a great thing. Let me share my screen with you really quickly. So I have a Pinterest page because I told you that I like Pinterest, which is a product ideas for my company, Mesocy, okay?  It's like a huge page.

1:02:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And all of these things are almost all of them are like physical products that I could send to

1:03:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  my customers that communicate the way mesocyclic works, right, and like it could be a kid, it could be like look at this kid, this is like the expensive, very cool, very fancy stuff, right, but it could also be like a member's card, you know, like when you do an experience with you receive like a cool card that you put in your wallet that says you've done this thing, know, it's like nobody else has this, and like logistically speaking, this is something easy for you to make and to send them, imagine like if it's made of metal or some plastic, you know, there's many things we can do that exist in the physical world, but they communicate something symbolic, you know, like this, like a coin, yeah, like the alcoholics and anonymous coin,

1:04:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, he has a coin, right?

1:04:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I have it. Yeah, so yeah, so that's exactly so that's the kind of thing So I think there's and these products what I like about this sort of products is that they do not require a lot of effort to Maintain them right.  It's not like a course you need to update all the time.

1:04:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's just something they get and they will see Anyway, so this was to show you how I'm doing it I've seen more ideas about this And that that's it and what what I was thinking, you know for for me, it's kind of a posture the the posture it's also like It's all right.  What idea so they can have like kind of a follow-up Yeah Let me see have you heard about the 30 challenge to enlightenment.  I have not know I think this the last thing because we can go so long but do you see my my side you know this is a big posture that is your epic live experiments you know and maybe we could say uh your first live prototype you know so a scratch here like put it in your room ah nice scratch you know and did you did did you take the time today to sleep early or something like that you know you don't know like or did you mind map today or did you write it or something but I we we can develop some like a posture together you know like fits my clients needs and also like the the cohort program and things like that and we could send them so they can have like a something like a verification list of what they're doing you know during the program so it's it's visualization you know

1:06:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. It's like, it's a, it's a, it's convergence of several things.

1:06:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So visualization is a physical product.

1:06:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's something that, you know, stays in your desk and you see it, it reminds you of you. It's something that also says something about your own horse's commitment to their success.  Like, oh, this guy really cares about me applying these lessons, right? It's easy to send via mail. It's something that if they put in the bag, people say, what's that thing?  Oh, that's something I did with Jorge. That's a school post.

1:06:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  you know, I can tell you more about it.

1:06:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it's cheap to make, you know. it's cheap to make, exactly.

1:06:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And there's an interactive aspect to it.

1:06:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, you probably have these in Mexico as opposed to this Catholic country, the Christmas calendar with the little doors.  Yes, kind of thing. So I love this stuff. I think it's really interesting. And I think it fits with the kind of commitment to results that you're talking about, right?  this is a constant in everything you talk about, commitment to results, I want people to actually do this stuff, it happens after the experience, you the value it's like you bringing this into your life.  yeah, definitely. The thing is, the thing is, for the first version of the six week, what can we do that is simple and that maybe we can increase in the next turn, right?

1:07:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So maybe just do it digital at the beginning or just have it as a big framework, the micro system and that's it, know, or having in a mirror and they can, you know, they can both like in the facilitator school, they have this character mix and match kind of, have you seen it?  And so it's confused so they can just move their things, you know, or they can select, you know, you have three types of buttons, the red one, the yellow one and the green one.  So you're selecting which one you like, okay, did you assist this day? So, I don't know, maybe something you see.  here. But yes, yes, we can still keep talking about ideas. But at the end, I think we understood each other.  yes, I need to just finalize my program because I want to purr my soul. I just don't want to be one more program to sell.  I want to purr my soul into it. That's why I want to be very... The first iteration is to be like the iPhone.  I feel like that way. I mean the Steve Jobs vibe. I want it to be perfect in a way.  Okay. I think you know what I would say to that.

1:08:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a dangerous thing. If I can... In between this and our next conversation, if I could give a suggestion, is to try to do it for someone that is many steps behind you.

1:08:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You are very sophisticated.

1:09:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  their clients are not. Of course, they are less than you, right? Of course. But you're very sophisticated, and it's very difficult for experts to forget the fact that they are way ahead of their clients.

1:09:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So maybe try to write it for a family member that doesn't really understand what you do, or something like that.

1:09:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I think that could help you. It's difficult, but I think it's useful.

1:09:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, like, why am I deciding on design thinking? Because I thought like, lots of people know design thinking, but I've been talking with clients and not anyone, just maybe 10% or 5% knows about design thinking.  And when they say, you know what design thinking, okay, tell me what's design thinking. Yeah, exactly.

1:09:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. mean, it's so difficult to leave our conversations because we get but the thing is design thinking, and this is so interesting, was invented

1:10:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So people could understand what the design process was.

1:10:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So design thinking is a simplification of the design process, right? And for most people that are not aware of the design process, you need to go even simpler.

1:10:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So instead of saying, oh, we do design thinking, do, we say, oh, we focus on having structured creativity.

1:10:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And people are like, okay, I don't know what design thinking is, but structured creativity, I kind of understand.

1:10:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Stuff like this? Yes.

1:10:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah. So I really gotta go now, otherwise I'll pee in my pants.

1:10:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, me too. Me too, but thank you, thank you for the energy. I will put it on the email to see how and when can we start, okay?

1:10:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, final question, apologies. So this is about frameworks.

1:10:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I really like doing the frameworks. And I'd like to find a way of being able to talk about of them that does not violate your intellectual property.

1:11:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe think about this, or I can blur out things.

1:11:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I will not share anything without your proposal view, if you're OK with that.

1:11:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I'd love to find a way of talking about it without giving away your own ideas, right? So maybe we can figure this out.  Yes.

1:11:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In the next conversation, yes, because I also want to have you, and people can see how you work. But without giving the idea of that, let's see how it works.  But yes, I really want to help you, OK?

1:11:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. Thank you so much.

1:11:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This was great. That's your tool.

1:11:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have a nice time.

1:11:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Bye.
