0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Energy, energy plus, how are you?

0:06 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Damn that was a really good that was a really good start.

0:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean I've been practicing in front of the mirror wife does love it, but I love the game.

0:17 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh, I appreciate that. I'm gonna send in my note taker because I have to Distill my notes after this conversation.  Oh, yeah, bring it in It's probably coming in now.

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm mom if you don't mind I'm gonna like move around because I do some good thinking when I'm moving around Oh So you're telling me I also need to stand up for a second to pick up a piece of paper But I'm hearing you for sure.  So I guess that when you take a phone call you keep facing the room, right?

0:45 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh a hundred percent. That's all I do That's literally all I do I will paste it around in circles in squares.  It doesn't matter Yes, yeah,

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I do the same and I think I got it from my dad. I didn't notice it because Because I live in a different country.  I see them more rarely and it's funny I find myself doing the things that he does and it's probably genetic or it was like a dormant memory and suddenly I'm doing the same things.

1:21 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh I don't know where it comes from. I just know that it's better doing it All right, so question for you Go ahead for you in your talk Very early So yeah, I don't have the slides.

1:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have some notes. Yeah, what has been more challenging for me is the 15-minute thing So actually on this call it will be easier for me to just you know be a sounding board for you Because I was just I was assuming slash expecting it.  Maybe you have more stuff than I did

2:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Bear I have this is what I've done last week. I wrote something. Okay. I ripped it up Literally, I ripped it up like I started today being like I don't like it.  Like I really didn't I didn't like it and I think I'll be honest. I think the title I started with has harmed me The title that went into the agenda.  Yeah, I It's a good title, but I think it's not the right approach and to be quite honest, that's fine like in all honesty It's fine.  I'm also overthinking this but So I'm sorry, I started from scratch again this morning and when you say sorry from scratch I mean like there's obviously a foundation there as to what I know I don't want to do but It's funny because I've done these in the past and I have like previous talks But it's not the one I want to do to this group.  Mm-hmm. I feel like I want to try something different with this group and I'm experimenting stuff And so my topic and I'm just going share the framing of it and I want you to be, and then I want you to be critical and thoughtful and just be you basically be you.  I'll start here which is let me frame it. The title of my post or the title of it is the word value is broken and price is paying for it.  So the word value, the reason why I'm choosing the word value is because I do think that there is this mix up with value based pricing.  So here's the framing. Here's like my context. I do think that that we live in a world where we try to all value based price or we've all read the book by Ellen Weiss or some version of it and been told to do such such a thing.  And it's hard. It's really freaking hard. I mean, I'm in it every single day and it's still really freaking hard, right?  And I think while I wanted to start this, I wanted to talk about the problems with. pricing, or how to get better at pricing, or how to raise your rates.  I should be the pricing strategist who does that, but in reality, I think I want to take this from a secondary lens, which is like, I just want to talk about the word value, and I just want to rewire the brains a little bit to reconsider what it actually means, as opposed to even talking about pricing.  So that's actually the context as to what I'm saying, I think you are also a first principles thinker, and so that is the thesis behind it, which is I want to break down, I want to rewire, I want to break it down to first principles, and kind of rewire it back up.  And I want them, I'm going to use the word pricing, but I want it to like lead them to pricing instead of me saying, like, this is why your pricing is broken.  Okay, immediate thoughts there, and I'll give you the guts of it.

5:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so the first thing that came to me was, first there's the issue of expectations that people might arrive at the call at the session expecting something and either you reorient them at the beginning or, I mean, or they figure it out as it goes.  And the other thing that came to me, but I don't know, you're going to show me, is it feels that this sort of rewiring is very valuable and dishes for 50 minutes, I think.  I like it.

5:43 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Fortunately, my talk is only to be scheduled for 10 minutes. I'm only going to do 10 minutes. Am I also for 10 minutes?

5:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'm going to do 10 minutes.

5:52 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  The reason I'm going to do 10 minutes is because I'm going to guess that there's going to be a lag.  be a delay yeah smart and so by the time I and I'm late I'm 315 or three o'clock in the afternoon eastern time so like by that time I it could be it could be like 430 by the time I start talking that's clever and uh I also thought about this as being if I want to make it a little bit more memorable one way to make it more memorable not on the topic is by changing the format meaning like if I make a five-minute talk and like that's it I might be like oh that was interesting that was just five minutes like I can't tell if that was good or not right so I just thought about some of these like secondary effects of just a talk itself it's perfect yeah I'm thinking the same way yes yes um I don't think we're gonna get Q&A live because Q&A live will just derail the timeline of it so that's my guess um okay  I actually like the feedback, which is in 15 minutes it'll be hard to rewire the brain. That is just true is I'm also not trying to totally rewire it.  But I think what I might be doing is to plant the seed to say you've been using the word value a lot and you've been using it in your pricing, you've been using it in your work.  And I just want you to take a moment to think about what that word actually means to you. I think that is literally my takeaway.  And it's a really obvious statement. And it's really, but it's one of those things which is sometimes it's the fundamentals that actually matter most and you just got to just got to break it down.  What's your, what's the immediate thought and response to that?

7:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's interesting if you provide people with seeds for the reflection. So, oh, people usually think about value in these three different ways.  I actually... I think it's these three other different ways. So we don't rely too much on them actively reflecting on what you're saying.  The really clever ones will be paying attention and will be thinking ahead and they will see what you're trying to say.  The other ones might just be little bit lost. So that's it. I mean, you can do that. And I suggest that maybe you provide some alternative visions of the word value.  All right, I appreciate this.

8:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  so now I'm going to flip it and say, OK, I have two parts in my title, which is the word value is broken and price is paying for it.  So one framing is I can understand, I can share why I believe the word value is broken. So three reasons as to why.  So that is then instead of a total rewiring, that is like setting up a problem. Here's the three reasons why why I would say value is broken.  One it's treated as an objective truth but in reality it's a subjective comparison value measure and we we tend to forget that.  right. One two it's a filler word we use for weak sales language right. The word value actually has no meaning in itself.  It's not specific enough and yet we try to use it as something that is specific. Actually as a matter of fact we try to use it as a noun but in reality it's it's actually an adjective.  I know the word value is a noun but it's the word valuable is actually the word that matters. And then it means obviously it means too many things to too many people just kind of like the word brand and strategy there's there's it needs to have a model associated with it.  Those are all like really really simple obvious things and the reason why I think that that matters is to say oh yeah you know what you're right I do I want the the head nods right you know it's it's not it is subjective right it is the buyers determined it's the buyers work  Choose not mine right in it. I do use the word value when I do in some of my sales language or some of my words You know what I do actually think about value It could be used really really tiny like in one transaction, but also it could used in multiple things So I think that's three simple ways to articulate it and my fear of doing such is that it's oversimplified But this is also the what's the word?  The posturing in me, which is like this needs to be super smart.

10:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hey, it can't just be super simple Immediate thoughts after those three those three I think they are easy to agree agree and Which I think is a good thing there's probably like an ideal ratio of Nodding and so I don't know what it is, but I think that the concept  is useful. I think from a dynamic, from the dynamics of the talk, something that maybe you can do is to include things that make them go back to the way they feel about these pain points, right?  So when you say, oh, three reasons why the world value is broken, and before you jump into the three reasons, perhaps you can use little snippets of situations that people are familiar with, know, like you're sending a proposal, you're not sure, you're feeling posture syndrome, I don't know, something that people are like, yeah, this guy gets me.  And now I want to know what's the other framing.

11:52 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Okay, so now the other side is, okay, do you rebuild pricing logic, right? Or how do you rebuild it on the  on the other side. So if you build up to say why it's broken, how do you fix it, right?  And here's where I thought I could also be a little bit more memorable. And like you were saying, it's like, get three.  So it's like three obvious, not so obvious. So one not so obvious way to reframe the way that you think about value is to not use the word.  Like ban it, try to ban it from, from your actual vocabulary as you talk about what you do, how you do it in conversation.  Don't put it on, don't put it in your proposals. Don't put it on your sales page. Don't talk about it with the word client.  Try to play a game yourself and to never use the actual word, right? I like this. That's one, right?  Is because it's not your word to choose. It's not your word. It's not, it's not something that you actually own.  Yeah, that's one, that's like one game to play with. The other is instead of like thinking about how All right, so here's another one, which is we tend to think about either cost, value, and we price.  My whole, I would say, is strip all that down and do an exercise for yourself, which is to start with price.  Put a price on the page and answer the single question, which is, what would need to be true if I want this price, right?  If I want this to be my price, what would need to be true, right? And it's not just going say that this is your price.  But what it is designed to do is for you to basically put yourself in the buyer, buyer shoes, right?  Instead of like deriving price, it's doing the opposite. And what you are actually doing is you are thinking now as a buyer in the lens of value relative to that price, moving the areas around it.  And so that's an exercise in which you can take, whether it's a new project or it's a new service or it's your existing stuff, right?  If I want to raise my price, what needs to be true? And when you do it that way, you actually, you reframe the word value from  Something that creates the price to the price driving the actual value, and it's actually a little bit of a top-down Element so that start with price instead of end with price that would be a second mm-hmm, and then a third one home.  Let go to my notebook So this so this the only problem with You're gonna see that a little bit of a challenge in here And it would be like if you were to use the word value like if whenever you talk about the word value It must always have a modifier in front of it.  So right so it's replacement value Contribution value it's perceived value. It's face value, right? You it the word itself like strategy and like some of those other words require a modifier Because the word because like word value Can be this big thing, right?  But in reality what you want to do is you want to make it as small as possible as Specific as possible.  So the reason why I'm struggling with that is because I think the word

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the first word the first part is really good burn the ban the word value right that's a really good memorable statement start with price it's also pretty memorable right it is it is an exercise the third one which is the rule is like use a modifier every single time you use the word value kind of contradicts the first one that's where I got a little bit stuck I lose I lose my I lose the punchiness of that first one could you invert it and say ban the word at the end yeah I guess I could do that simple to hard yeah because and also I think that this creates you know you know makes people pay attention so basically and in it's also like the simple to hard so begin with a modifier and people like hmm okay so this means that value can be different things and Peter is telling me that  there's a few different things, maybe there's a list, you can even use like a table or a matrix and use different modifiers with value and make people understand oh yeah yeah yeah value can be seen from different perspectives which is like useful, this is an insight, is useful and actionable okay got it and then actually maybe start start with start with price I think that's interesting and that's also something that people connect to because whenever you see advice around sales there's always people that say no I just say a price and then force yourself to work up to be worth that price and I think people recognize this.  Your projects are worth half a million dollars so say it and now figure out how to make them worth half a million dollars so yeah maybe that's the first one start with price the second one is  add a modifier, because it is also kind of a cop out for people that like, yeah, I get your point, but I'm not really confident enough to say, to start with a price is not helping me.  So you say, no, there's another way. It just starts with a modifier and you provide a list of modifiers.  And the third one, you can frame it as, so this one is for the brave ones or the ones wanting for an extra challenge, like just don't use the word value.  And I think the sequence works.

17:32 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  And the takeaway from there is by doing these, by doing one of these things, right, either your discovery process improves, which discovery unearths problems and it actually allows you to sell your price, derive your price.  It will help you get more specific, right, specific leads to clarity. and clarity, forces, precision, right? So all of these are indirect ways to change your pricing.  And I think my major takeaway is the reason why is because you cannot simply change your price. In order for you to change your price, you must turn the dial that turned the price for you.  Yes, that's the purpose, right? So my whole thing is you can't just change price. You must change everything around it for the price to be justified.  And we use that term of changing everything around it called value. So if you want to change price, you must change everything around it.  And that is the value of what you provide. I will try not to use that word, that's what I think the aha moment is in a sense.  So first part is the obvious breakdown as to why value is broken. And even technologists say, hey, this may not, this may be obvious to you, but I'm going to ground you in principle.  Ground you in logic. I'm going to ground you and and remind you that this is to be true because I need you to realize and become aware Second is all right.  Here's three new get here's three ways the new rules to play by If you want to improve the way in which you value or approve the way in which you price Here are three ways to go about doing it three exercises that you can do on your own because and that leads up to the main takeaway and that main takeaway is because the reason I'm telling you this is price being the acceptance of revenue Everybody has a price in order for you to change your price up down sideways You must turn the levers or turn the dials around it because you cannot turn cannot change price directly You must do the things that influence price Okay, I'm thinking This this sentence you can't just change the price you need to change everything around it.

19:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's very powerful and What I'm thinking, so I'm thinking out loud now. What I'm thinking is, is this a punchline, or is this a hook, you know?  I don't know, just putting it up there. So let me kind of role play this really quickly. Session starts, you make a quick intro, and then there's a part of it, which is the reasons why the word value is broken.  And there's three reasons. Okay. I think a way of presenting this in my mind is a reason plus a situation that they can recognize.  So we think of it as objective, but it's actually subjective. And then you put like a quote or something like, yeah, or something like in a story format.  you know, that client that said this was a strategic thing to them, but they were not able to pay $10,000, I don't know.  Second reason, it's a fewer words for sales language and it just, you say it's what we do when we need to send a proposal at 11 at night and we need to, you know, talk about it.  And people are like, yes, yes, I've done this. And it's too broad because you struggle when explaining it to your family at the barbecue and like, yes, yes, I get it.  Stuff like this. reason plus something, situations that they can relate to. And then you shift into the more active, so we have this context now, we agree on this context, there's ways of reframing the rebuilding.  Okay, wait. So the word is broken. I'll to fix it, right? I'll to fix it. Okay, and you said that there were three non obvious and three obvious.  Is that it? I just stuck with three non obvious.

22:16 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  So I gave three obvious reasons why they were broken. So three non obvious ways to help you regain the fix it.  Okay. Okay.

22:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like this because then you can also, uh, acknowledge the fact that, you know, people have had access to information such as the money you're providing them, but for some reason it didn't connect.  So and, and the way it didn't connect is because maybe a lot of advice around value and pricing is like very easy to nod and not to, to agree to, but hard to, to implement, right?  So you say, I have three non obvious ways by being non obvious. There are different from the things you're being used to.  So they're like, okay, let me see what, Peter is saying, and you say, you start with price. You don't start with value, you start with price, and then you create the conditions for that price to be justified.  And this hints at your conclusion or hook, I don't know. The second is you can experiment adding a modifier.  Okay, and people start to see, oh yes, there's different ways, tangible ways of thinking about value. And the third one is like, if you really want to go crazy with this, just ban the word, don't use the word value and force yourself to figure out a different way of communicating this sort of thing.  If you force yourself, oh, When you said, by doing this, you improve the discovery and you force precision. There's two things.  Are those related to banning the word or the three non obvious ways?

23:52 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Interesting. No, because that's a good point. There's a disconnect there because the discovery process is where you determine the problem.  Yeah, there's a disconnect there. I think I would to move that out. I'd have to remove that. I honestly don't feel that there's a disconnect.

24:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was asking because there's kind of a fractal, because I'm making like a mind map of it. There's kind of a fractal nature to this.  To me, each of the three ways improved both discovery and precision. Maybe some of them are stronger, one thing or the other, but they all serve these things by banning the world is perhaps the strongest thing, but by starting  price also forces you to do to be really good at discovery and figure out what the clients really appreciate so we don't use the word value that makes it justify that price you know and also forces you to be precise in how you describe what they get out of it so to me the two advantages of forcing yourself to fix the word value apply to all of the three strategies you've mentioned yeah I guess that's a really good connection because where where pricing lives like where pricing is truly derived even if you have fixed pricing or you do cost it is derived in the discovery conversation right it's just derived in what the client actually needs wants and those outcomes that are right yeah that's where it is in the discovery is in the scoping process that's

26:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  actually where this plays. So in your scoping process, right? Or in the process of getting up to the scoping process or the discovery process, you use modifiers and you get more specific, right?  Whether you eliminate the word value entirely, your prep work, right? So if your prep work is to start with price or your prep work is to only use modifiers to think about it, or your prep work to the proposal is to think in terms of these modified value relative to what the individual said, or your prep work is to eliminate the word value and get to more precise, right?  I guess this is all converging prior to discovery, during the discovery, after the discovery, until you've settled on the price.  So it's interesting because that is now very much geared towards

27:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  my clientele which do custom specialized premium strat strategic work it's not necessarily a fixed price so I maybe you should you should say that's your clientele at the at the start yeah I think that will frame the discussion and people are like yeah I sell ads for nutrition supplements they'll instantly like self-qualify out of okay maybe this is not exact for me yeah cuz that is true like what I like what I am talking about is I mean the word value is still relative but what I'm talking about here is more strategic custom work yeah the the sound why you cannot just change the price you need to change everything around it so I think there's three  The first one is to use it as a hook, the second one is to use it as a punchline, and the third one, that just occurred to me, I don't know, could be used as in repetition.  Okay, so every time you make a strong point, you put a slide with a sentence in front of it.  At some point people are primed to, yes, I see, because this would make the sentence, you cannot just change the price, you need to change everything around it.  By connecting the sentence back to, like a spiral instead of a line, back to the concept that we're introducing, people are like, yes, I can see the POV, the perspective of Peter on this, and I can see how coherent it is.  That's another possible approach. That's a word you need to use for sure, and you need to use it in a strong way, because it's a very good, not worth the phrase.

29:07 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Your value is broken, price is paying for it, and that's because you cannot just change the price. You have to change everything around it.  I'm just saying that's technically the connective tissue right there, right, is if in the buyer's mind, I see what you're saying, which is have a have a through line, actually have a through line, like the punchline at the end, but I do also realize that at three o'clock in the afternoon and to make it memorable is either up front or at the end.  So one way I can do it is to keep repeating that one line. I think I would probably make it the make it the hook.

29:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And even if you make it the hook, can bookend it at the end. actually by using it at both ends you're doing like with editors often talk about which is you tell people what you tell them you tell them the thing and you tell them you just told them the thing right so people you know just see the the perfect connection so I'm okay with that I like that idea which is like here's the take here's a takeaway like I'm right up front bottom line up front here's the takeaway yeah in the middle I'm reminding you again right here's the takeaway now the only interesting nuance of this is the start with price concept is a little bit reverse of that right so if I say if I say that you can't just change the price you have to change everything around it right start with price is a little bit of the opposite of that right yeah but yeah I see your point but you can acknowledge this

31:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  So if you acknowledge it like tongue-in-cheek it's okay you say I know I know let me just finish this is a useful exercise for you to because the thing is the point does not contradict itself yeah when you go to the price you are forced to think about the things around the price so it's still coherent yeah right because it's not just like you can't just write if you start with price you just go from 100 to 200 and you've done nothing all right that's not going to hold and it just meant you're going to price probably the beginning but if you start with price it forces you to think what else do I need to do around my business inside the way in which I communicate outside in order to justify or clarify that price and that is actually what you're saying which is it's not just starting price it's changing the stuff around it yeah okay all right is this to so here's my question is this now to  Is this too simple? Is this wrong audience? Is this worth listening to? And yeah, what's your overall assessment as to this framework?  I think it makes sense.

32:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's opinionated, which I think is a good thing. But I think to me, if you could end on a very actionable takeaway, I know you just described three exercises, but a very actionable takeaway could be useful.  Okay, so I have a list. Let me just begin. Just a second. Okay. Yeah, I don't love this list anymore, he used to.  But anyway, so these are some ideas I've collected around things that convey that you are an expert, right? So using precise definitions, having simple explanations for simple things, for complex things, honing in on the relevant fact from a myriad.  Is it myriad or myriad?

33:33 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Myriad. Yeah. Myriad.

33:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Myriad of possibilities. Experts make less mistakes. Experts think of second-order effects. Experts are good at pattern recognition.  It's related to the briefness. And experts can usually think about alternatives, right? And I think you've displayed these things in the whole.  You start with definitions, provide simple explanations for the complex theme around value. From all the different things, you provide a simplified thing that people need to pay attention to, make less mistakes is a more unactive thing, so it's difficult to prove here.  You think about second order effects, which you do, like start with price and figure out things around it, which is that kind of thing.  Pattern recognition, yes, especially if you include examples of things that they can see themselves in, and being able to think of alternatives, which you also do by providing the three different prompts or nudges or exercises.  So related to my previous point of, can we make this more like, oh my god, I don't even want to listen to the next conversation because I want to start doing the things that Peter has just told me.  not wait. Is there anything we could put in there?

35:27 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  See, because it's centered on value, not centered on price, because I could have somebody run. Start with price as a design constraint.  It becomes an interesting exercise. What would I need to make this true? And the way is there's three ways in which you can do that.  So I let now I'm gonna just spill which is You change the perception you change the outcomes you change the buyer All right, those are the those are the ways in which you can start with price and Either raise your rates or change it that way so How Would I do that?  How would I want how would I want them to immediately start? I Don't know if I don't know if it's that stuff that way, but now I know I can think about that Mm-hmm.

36:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think maybe one thing that you perhaps do is Every single one of these non-obvious ways despite being actually  described in an active way. They are still something that requires some translation into what do I actually do, right?  So you could put it like this. So at the end, you say, hey guys, if you send me an email, I'll send you an email.  And a quick exercise is that you can do and you can just reply to me in the body of the email, right?  So you could, let me be super specific, very concrete. You send them, after your call, you send them an email, let's say something like, set a timer for 15 minutes and try to describe the value of your work for these three different combinations of modifiers.  And you can have another exercise, which is set a timer for, I don't know, five minutes and make a list of four words.  You can go and chat to PT, but it's best if you try to do it yourself that you can use instead of value.  And parenthesis, I know that this is not exactly the core of banning the word value, but it's just a way to get them to type things down.  And in terms of start to the price, the prompt is, so if you accept the truth of it's a good idea to start with the price, what things do you know that you could have been doing, but you haven't for some reason, you know, and all of these things are like useful questions, like they are like coaching questions, and if you place them in a context where answering them is easy because it's in the email and it's quick.  People might do it, you know But then you just what we want is like the bait you to be able to send these prompts to people that you know expressed interest and Yeah, either you just put your email on the slides and say say hi or just put a Link in the a link in the networks or a QR code perform, you know something like that Yeah, I could actually think about this which is for one banning the word value It's like you could actually go back now that we have all of our calls recorded now Right, you can go back to your calls your sales calls proposals and you go to your website and count the number of times in the last like the number of times you use the word value All right, what is how many times do you actually use the word value in the last such-and-such calls?

39:52 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I Think the exercise is good.

39:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, go, but it's something that I Suspect most people will not do I could go on Fatum and try to control Find8 and so on, but I probably won't.

40:04 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  What does that do? Yeah, what does that actually do?

40:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I probably do, because I know the point that you were trying to make before I do the exercise. So yeah, that's fair.

40:12 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah. Okay, I see what you're saying. This is the workshop mind. The game's mind with your guillotine, your guillotine, which is hilarious, by the way, that post.  Thank you. Okay, wait, all right, so let's pause because you just enabled me to speak for 40 minutes, which is hilarious also because this is a five minute talk, right?  Was it 40 minutes already?

40:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. Yeah, it's Wow.

40:45 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Wow. All right, I need to pause because I need to add, you just said you are, where are you in this process?  Okay.

40:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, way behind you. I don't know exactly what's, which of the several possible points that could be making, right?  So there's one which is the workshops are good, and maybe you should be doing them. And, but I think that's to transparent.  And people know that I'll talk about workshops, but I don't want to make it look like a pitch. And another one is like ways you could start using workshops in your work, like very practical tips, and I have written about this, and I can talk about this.  But this one doesn't really talk, the second direction doesn't really frame the problem, right? So the third direction is more around framing the problem.  And the ways I've been thinking about framing the problem are all related to this web of things, which is, you know, it's out there and  differentiation, problems are complex, you need to have tools to work with complex problems, workshops are like that, workshops, you know, start to become more famous around the time that science got more integrated, which is also a signal that it is not a new path.  It's a thing that was developed to deal with increased complexity, which I'm sure you guys are facing. So this third one is the nerdy one, right?  And I like it. But I'm not sure.

42:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  you are exactly where I was, which is the problem that you're experiencing is a little bit of cursive knowledge.  100% focused on cursive knowledge, right? And I'll tell you one thing. I've now we've now spoken three or four times and your emails and you know, with this  sound crazy, or you might think I'm dumb, but like, I still feel that word workshop is confusing. Like, I don't, I'm not entirely certain.  When I hear that word, I think of something different. Now, I actually, when you said the word the games the other day, I actually thought it was a perfect description, like a lead-in to workshop.  And I don't know if it's just me, but the word workshop is a different word when it comes to agencies and consulting.  Between the two, mean?

43:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is my video frozen?

43:41 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, your video is frozen. That's okay.

43:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But can you phrase the thing you just said? you mean it's a different thing for...

43:55 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh, you're back.

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it means different things for agencies and consultants. That's what you said.

44:03 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I think what I'm saying is, I hear that I think about what a workshop is. And there are different ways in which, because you're talking about how do you distill your concrete knowledge in packaging it into something smaller, right?  And I would almost go as far to say, you breaking down what the heck a workshop really is and how to get tangible, like you do when you're writing, would be amazing.  It feels like it's simple. Going back to your levels of expertise, right? You just read to me your things of expertise.  And I feel that if you were to frame the word workshop and you were to own the word workshop, you gave me the through line.  I would love to hear how you want me to think about the word workshop. Like that to me is a new word in my.  Like in my in my brain, like it's not really a new word But I feel like you have the the opportunity right now to plant that as a new word in people's brains.  I Don't hear a lot of people saying no, I don't actually you're the only individual I know that uses the word workshop the only one and I think that the dilution are you so there?  No, no, I'm here Yeah, you're the the cameras for you. Well either way is like I feel like you were the only person The only person the word offer is taken right the word gateway is taken wedge is taken like the word work I don't know a single person who use the word workshop other than you and I think you just tap it would be great for you to tap into that Okay, this is very useful And it's it's sound I feel like it sounds really over over simplistic to you But I'm telling you right now is I'm going back to your principles Man they take the complex and make it super simple

46:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  why did you why do you call workshop for the record that's that's a name that's a name of that kind of meeting so the act of the verb that you do when you run a workshop you are facilitating that's a verb and the workshop is the frame is the kind of meeting that you have when you are a facilitator but I think this really useful for many reasons first one yeah I think not a lot of people have shared definition of workshop and you're not the first person or the third maybe not the fifth that tells me you what we've been talking for a while I'm not sure what you do and and so this tells me that I need to do more work on on the definitions I do have definitions so I can use them and I think that's you know starting by with the definition we can also connect with  you know, advantages, what makes a good workshop, know, how we can help you, but we start with the definition and I think that's useful.

47:14 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I think you just said the hook, honestly, is like the word workshop. So the word workshop, know, I feel like I know what it is, but I would not apply that word to consulting.  Like that, like I feel like it's a word and the way in which you describe it, they don't go in the same place like facilitation and consulting or facilitation and agencies like workshop, like I can think of a workshop business or a facilitation business in which that's what they deliver.  But what I think I have always when as I read yourself is like, how do I apply this concept to your business?  Right? Is that what that's what you're saying? Mm hmm. Yeah. And I think. That is what is so cool, is starting off this conversation, is, use the word, and I'm not telling you how to hook, but it's like, I use the word workshop all the time, I've had conversations with people, and what's so troubling is that you are taking this simple concept and you're trying to place it in an area in which it doesn't normally exist.  You're creating a new ecosystem, right? It is the new animal inside the ecosystem and nobody knows what the heck it is.  And it's like, oh, okay, finally, I'm going to get a nice, I'm going to get, I'm going to get the definition.  So the hook is, hey, there is a lack of clarity and I'm going to give it to you right now, because I think what you're telling me, and very similar to what I was trying to do was how do I plant seed the rewiring in the brain to say, oh, I get it.  Like, oh, and then once I say, oh, I get it, like, oh, how can I actually use this in my, in my business, right?  And I think that that would be. I would love to personally hear it from you live as opposed to just your written word or just your meaning like LinkedIn or I know you've been doing videos recently, which I do like and Simple but I feel it would be effective God I like this I like this hundred people who haven't met you yet Yes, yes, no, I like this I like because like I said workshops people I've had different experiences the word is used in the wrong way but Facilitative consulting and more and this kind of things are more in the you know collective consciousness.

49:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So kind of perhaps an angle is I'm not saying this the hook or the structure, but an angle is workshops are how you do facility Right, it's the context where it takes place  and Okay, yeah, I have something to work here for sure.

50:06 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  This is good And I wouldn't fear it being too rudimentary or simple like I'm gonna hammer that home because There is There is no I'll use I'll break my own word.  There is no value in going Into detail if I don't have fundamentals Yeah, which I actually think is part of my my thing right which is all support of my thing which is Like how can you describe value if you can't fundamentally describe the word itself?  How can you expect somebody else to happen? How do you expect the price? Hey, how do you and so like if I just heard the word workshop now all I'm gonna think about you like if you Peter pricing right like that was my job.  Yeah Yeah, now you need to be able to say workshop workshop workshop And plan to see this what that word actually means just like Justin Welch did with soul for no or and stuff like that Yeah, and this is just one page for sure.

51:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'll do this. It's good. It's very good Cool, what were you going to do like what did your gut tell you that you wanted to do?  I Think I was going into the Where the industry is going and why workshops help and I was I Was kind of assuming I now notice I didn't notice but I was kind of assuming that yeah, I'll say workshops Will get it, but it's true.  This has been a common thing people tell me like, you know what? It feels like you know about this workshop thing, but I still don't get it  And so that's not helpful. So I need to make people get it. And I have spoken about this. So I have content and things I can say.  And I think that's useful. can see your point. can see that I can see that's useful.

52:15 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  think it's actually really not funny, but super self-aware. To go up on stage and be like, I've been talking to this for a year and a half.  And people still don't get it. I'm going to fix that right now. So this is the place I'm going to fix that right now.  it's just a really cool setup. That would be a really cool setup. I talk to people 10 times, and they still don't know what I do.  And this is not designed to be a knock at you. No, it's not. I think what you are doing, truly, I fundamentally believe, as I read your work, that you are placing something in an ecosystem that did not exist before.  I really do. I hope it's not smallpox. thank you.

53:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's what I've been trying to do. So it's very rewarding to see the little sprouts of that. And I like that that start.  People, if you don't get it, today we fix it.

53:19 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Well, the other one where you said how it's changing and why workshops should be in that world does feel a little bit more like a pitch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, and this is why I felt like I talked about pricing. It's also feels like a pitch.  Mm, yeah.

53:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, understood. Understood. Yeah. It's good. Good. What if we do this?

53:50 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  You want to do this one more time before now that we'll have our actual speeches and do it on Tuesday and do an actual drive run or something like that?  Uh, yeah.

54:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would. Uh, so, uh, same time Tuesday, this work for you.

54:08 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm glad we did this, because we're both on the same page that we were not ready. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, let's see.

54:15 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  On Tuesday, can we do an hour later?

54:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, we can do it an hour later, yes.

54:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah.

54:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, should I set it for one and a half hours? Fine, yeah.

54:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah. We both end, end 10 minutes. That's it. 10 minutes. slides. I have to make. Yeah, I want to make my slides too.  I'm just going to make really simple slides.

54:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you paste your email here in the chat for some reason? was not picking it up on the calendar.  No.

54:51 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Sorry. What time do you use what time do you go like what order are you are you early?

55:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's see No, it doesn't say in here so I go One and a half hours ago, sorry so on my time is half past 11 All right, I feel better Me too think of it.

55:43 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It's amazing how we overthink this When you said first principles thinker I was like first principles over thinker Well, it's so it's so sad because like I have at least 20 things I've just written over  That's 20 weeks that I literally could have just turned into a talk and I was like nope not gonna do that I'm just gonna create something new Yeah, we love the work I think and then we find excuses to keep doing it Yeah, well when I was looking for me Okay, just another thing.

56:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know how you plan these things, but I'll probably Do mine on index cards, of course, and I found this to be really useful to figure out like them the structure of these things So I don't know if that's useful to you, but you know just put like The idea of the slide I put them on the table and you kind of feel the flow And if you don't have index card just enough I do that.

56:47 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I Just different color pieces of paper whatever nice. Yeah, I'll do Look at this. I'll tell you the last man.  I can't get I can't get away from this book You're the one that said it this one and um the the two bobs podcast you ever listen to bob oh my gosh they are so good they are it's annoying sometimes it is so they are so good and it is annoying it really is i'm like yes new episode  now i need to do these things i listen to many of them many times over and well all right how is how is i know that we are way over time but how is like work and business going for use since we've spoken so i think since he's spoken i close a few things and deliver i actually the pipeline now is a little bit dry i was thinking about the clever words for that and um

58:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've hired, I've bought like a training package for sales, sales for nice people from Martin Stellar. I'm excited about that.  I've been reading a book, I really like it, wait, I'll pick it up, I really, really like it. So, it's this one, let's get real or let's not play.  So, it's sales of complex services and I think it's really well explained and it's making sense. I'm having fun with it.  So yeah, what I've noticed is that basically I'm making that shift into, you know, learning less about the craft and learning more about selling the craft and being present and talking to people and so on.  But yeah, the pipeline is not great as we speak, but actually I'm not panicking. So I guess that's a good thing.  Okay, that's good.

59:29 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  That's a good follow-up, which is I'm not panicking right now. So long as you don't do work, that feels like work, but it's not actual the work that you need to do.

59:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, the podcast is a little bit like that, but I'm trying to get it out of the way and just shift it.

59:50 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Shipping things is really important. Yeah, I know you. Yes, definitely is very important. All right, well, I Don't think you're alone in the in the dry spell in terms of the pipeline.  I do I feel like a lot of people are doing the same way yeah, and it could be because we're all Getting a little bit too focused in on the LinkedIn as our buyers sort of thing.  I Really fundamentally believe this to be true, which is when we We are on LinkedIn and we think our buyers are on LinkedIn But in reality even if they are and they're the lurkers there is an array of individuals that are out there Which are not on LinkedIn or are not connected to us and we we forget about that we get too narrow And I don't yeah narrow in the sense like go brah.  I'm just saying it's like There are other people around and we have to like how do we get to them?  How do I fish? How do I how do I go and find them sometimes? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.

1:00:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  agree and I Yeah for that quirkiness, I guess.

1:02:03 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Well, yeah.

1:02:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah, I'm thinking about how to make it. It's so funny, because I think the whole thing was about me becoming legible.  And I thought that workshops were more legible than perhaps they are. And if I need to educate the market, is there something that, the problem is that maybe I'm seeing it from to up close now, but I'll just want to reap the benefits of starting to claim the workshop thing, which is starting to work.  People seem to associate with that.

1:02:43 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  The ecosystem kind of thing.

1:02:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But maybe the delivery of that is not necessarily custom workshops. Maybe the delivery of that is something else. I don't know.  But yeah. I don't know just you put a lot of things in my mind right now both for the present you know the thing I'm looking outside frame and Yeah Okay What's next For for what I'm doing for my After the presentation after what what is next for you?  I have a few Prospects I want to circle back on and I'm thinking about doing a series on of content that is relating workshops to What I've been seeing on reports from the agency world  So it's, I think it's more pitchy, but yeah, there's, there's so many connections, it's not even like very difficult thing to do, like, oh, for this thing workshop to work in this way, but maybe not in this way, you know, and, and that, that's it.  And also, I think, I think finally that that's another thing. I really need to get my  together in terms of sales collateral and the website, because I think people, people that are interested in me as a person might find out, cool, this is so much, but I don't think it's, you know, very good at clearing out the questions around workshops.  It doesn't say what workshops are, so we should, I guess, that's, that's kind of a thing. And I'm also trying to, this is kind of related in a sense, to make it share more of the little things that I make, because I think that they  they contribute to this sense of taste, because if people are buying, not a lot, but if people are buying and they don't get what they don't understand what it is, what they're buying is the vibes.  I'm coming to terms with the, I do think that I have cool vibes on the things that I'm interested in.  I'm not saying I'm cool, but I'm like, some people have no aesthetics, no interesting things to say. I'm realizing, you know what?  I think I have. Maybe I should just share those things. So I'm thinking about, you know, sharing like the furniture I make, because all the furniture I make is around productivity, and like, it's thinking made physical.  And I love to talk about that, you know, was a good line thinking made physical.

1:05:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah. Whoa. Is that the title of your book? Wait, what's the new book title? Yeah, there's a book that's focused.

1:06:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, that's not the title.

1:06:03 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  That is an excellent phrase, thinking made physical. I'll need to go in a second because I'll have another one.  you're right.

1:06:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, if tickle my macrioste, I need to show you this. So I have a box of funny  that I'm trying to build kind of a periodic table of the physical things that are interesting and fun.  So on this thing, there's tokens and googly eyes. And I just have a few. You never know when you need the googly eyes, right?  And this one is suction cups and dice and magnets. I like having these things. And sometimes I buy more things, like wire and springs and stuff like that.  And I. I'm interested about the taxonomy of this stuff, so I can really see a periodic table which is like the elements of fun, something like that.  But that's not exactly the workshop thing, but I think it's very much on brand with the workshop thing. Anyway, sorry.  Wait, wait, wait.

1:07:25 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Can we go back to the concept of thinking made physical? Because are workshops a way to make the thinking made physical?  Yeah. Okay, you've literally just clarified exactly what it is now. Workshops are a way to make thinking or workshops are the means to enable thinking to be made physical.  So you are making the intangible motion tangible so that it becomes concrete and clear, so you know what to do with it.  Yeah, thinking made physical that is all right. That's so much clearer for the record.

1:08:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That is an image that is a freighter feeling Cool I mean like the you know the big samples the business model canvas and stuff like that exactly this I mean, that's why the business model canvas is famous and some other dude I don't know the some other central European University also has a much better model But no one knows about it because yeah, it's not made physical.  It doesn't travel.

1:08:32 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh I like I really I like that that thinking made physical and You can even describe it like yourself, right is you can this is why it relates to me Look at look at the furniture.  I make yeah, right? It's like this is why it's a part of me Oh, all right, you have to go but this is how our conversations unfold 59 minutes And all you need is one powerful takeaway in there and it just changes.  It's force multiple For sure, for sure, all right, well, we'll talk on Tuesday and then we will reconvene another day post that is not specific to our presentations, but in a way in which helps our business.  Cool. Thank you. Have a nice one. Thank you for this.
