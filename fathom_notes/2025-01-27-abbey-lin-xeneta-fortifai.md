0:00 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  Last week, Brian, you weren't there, how should we best do this? Abby, have you updated Brian or should we kind of start from the start from that?  I mean, I have updated him a little bit. I think Brian was there at the meeting where you went over.  Okay. When you went over some of this, like the platform, Brian, you were there, weren't you? Well, I wasn't in the last meeting last year.

0:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

0:33 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  He wasn't in the one that we had.

0:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We had just to confirm whether or not we should do that one. I can update. Maybe I'll just share that one too with the one that I kind of showed you, Abby, and then we can also go through that and then that kind of talks about it.  It's just because we are ready to launch in two weeks part of the platform, the policies, procedures, training, communications, that aspect of the content area.

0:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we wanted to kind of.

1:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Talk to you about how you wanted to set that up in the best way possible. I just have a presentation I can share with you and then we can discuss it.  I'm just going to pull it up. Okay, here it is. Great.

1:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are you seeing my screen?

1:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes.

1:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, great. So, yeah, last time we kind of showed you the overall design and we looked at risk management and we started building the kind of app from scratch from October.

1:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we're planning for a kickoff for it. And since then we've actually changed the design a little bit even more.  And that I'll show you a picture of it and that policies and communication is ready for deployment. And then we're also building up the environmental section of it for the ISO and then we're going to launch controls after that.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the main focus is to understand how to start testing the solution and to get feedback from you guys.  And so, this is the new design of the admin view for policies. So, this is what you'll be using.

2:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And this would be the employee view of the policy that once you deploy the policy and the training and communication, what they would be looking at.

2:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, sorry, I can hear you typing.

2:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then for the policies we have, we wanted to see what kind of policies you have. That we can kind of update and actually have them in the tool when it's ready to launch for you guys.  And then what other templates that we can put in there. And then we want to understand what is the best way to test in a way that's safe for you guys.  What other stakeholders, other than you two initial ones, if you want to include or maybe not, maybe you just want to individually test it out, the two of you first.  Or you want to test with some other people. If you do, then you can give us a name and we can give them access.  or just a wider group of people. But what are the thoughts? Do you guys want to start with the two of you guys, since you're two?  Some of the other ones are only one people, so that's why we asked this question. But what are your thoughts?  I think maybe option B.

3:15 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  think we would like to give, Brian, if you have any people. no, I think you're, that's right.

3:23 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Option B would be the best, because I would like to include SAC, which is Karla, yeah, because they're also working on either part of the ISA group.  They're working on some other related topics.

3:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK, great. Yeah, so if we get their emails, I think we have their emails from this meeting, then that should be fine for that.  And then like, so the feedback right now is like we're just more about the usability of it, especially around the only showing you that one section before we move to the next one.  So this feature works here. When I click this, doesn't work, or like this. look good. would like to be able to see certain things.  So that's kind of the level that we're looking at right now. Just to see before we deploy it like wider within the organization if you were to do that.  So in terms of communication I think Abby mentioned Slack. Some of our customers use only Teams. Some only use Slack.  Some only use Google. So we're trying to find the best way to get information. So it's more like a communication back and forth along with like document sharing if you want to put your policies there so that we can put them into our platform so you can edit it within there and check it there.  And in terms of testing feedback would you prefer to individually like test it and have a 20-minute call or we could just sit on the call while you test it and then we can do it that way.  You can give us your immediate feedback. Is there any Brian or Abby any preference? I would say we can just test it out in our own time and then schedule a call with

5:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  follow-up questions.

5:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, that sounds good and maybe we can have a forums or something that you can make comments in as you see it.

5:09 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  So I think those are the main ones.

5:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  are also launching, like there's different ones that we can launch in here. I think it depends on what you want launched.  Like, you know, we could just put a basic environmental policy, we could do a basic governance on the G side, which I know you guys are interested in.  So we'll put in like the basic ones, but it'd be good to go whatever documents you have or that can be the priority and then we can help fill in the blank some other documents that you might want in the process.  Since you're not going for the ISO, it's not as like you have to have X amount of policies. If you're going for the ISO, then we'd say you have to have these policies in here.  But since you're not, then we can be a little bit more flexible, but we want to also link the controls, which will be launching next, which around like, you know, the conflict of interest policy and some of these different things.  So we might need to update your policies to make sure they match with the controls to be able to meet the requirements.  That would be great to be able to have. I don't know if there's any other questions about this process, too.  Honestly, I don't have any other questions.

6:13 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  It's very straightforward. I would just like to test the platforms where it works and just play with it for a little bit to understand.

6:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

6:23 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  So I think these are some of the government's documents.

6:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So in it, we're only launching the policies, trainings, and communications part of it. I would say a very quick one to check through.  then the next would be the controls and then integrity hub and then the third party management and then risk management and auditing and reporting.  So it's going to be almost like every two or three weeks. Ideally, we're going to launch another part of it.  So it shouldn't take that long for the initial one because it's like upload a policy, review the policy, edit it, deploy it.  That aspect of it. So it should be pretty quick. So I think For my understanding, it is Slack, right?  Where you want the communication and where you can, we can put documents I've learned using, because we're using it with Cognite that they use Slack, that you can also put documents there and then they can upload any new documents.  So it's a good place to put information there. So we can discuss that, yeah. And then Abby, there were some points that we, we can discuss too, maybe like it's just environmental points or what are, you had sent me a message, me just grab it around sustainability policy, the reporting, measuring emissions and accessing the climate risk, yeah.

7:41 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  Yeah, so some of our investors have like recently sent us a survey with these like questions. I guess these are kind of like top of mine for us.  But yeah, that's why we... when do you need the deadline for it?

8:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  could also be put in the slack in terms of like, when do you need these answers back? And then we could also maybe do a segway answer, like we're, you know, we are in the environmental process where we will be looking at A, B, C and D there.  And then we can look at it.

8:16 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Well, we have a survey that had the deadline it's March, mid-March, remember the exact date. these policies, it was more like, why would I have them, let's create a plan to create them and, you know, or start like looking into what options we have, be all the sustainability policy, the report and all that Abby sent to you.  So it's more like, let's have a structure plan to see what and how we are gonna develop these sort of policy and reports.  Now, what I told them is that we're working with Fortify. So we could get access to the platform, review it and start creating these reports and policies.  Yeah, and we can help.

9:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Create like, you know, we're going to create a repository of policies so we can also have a discussion. I'd be like or in the slack like exactly which policies are you looking for and we'll develop it.  And that's what we've done for Cognite. It's like, especially they're going through that.

9:12 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  So 14,000 one.

9:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So they have really strict policies and guidelines. So we are like setting it up for them. And I think for your environmental policies, because you're also like a digital company like Cognite, we can also use very similar.  I would say processes. And from what I've seen in, and then, you know, it's the electricity and waste that I know you guys have been looking at and trying to collect and we're going to have that designed into our tool where you can collect it in our tool.  And then the other one is around asset management. If you guys have a way to manage like all of your computers and the like when it's out of use, do you recycle it or do you do something with it?  So that's like kind of something part of the policy. then the other one would be around your digital digital cloud usage.  So that's something we haven't talked about to myself. Digital cloud usage. Do you guys use Azure or who's your cloud provider?  it Google or is it Amazon or Google or Microsoft? It's probably one of those three. Amazon. Amazon. Okay. So then there will be some directions on how you can access your cloud usage and in there it will say how much CO2 consumption ideally.  Amazon all three of the cloud providers have that. And then you would also collect that and then you can use that towards your carbon figures in terms of your digital kind of, that would be probably your biggest CO2 emission as your cloud storage space.  yeah, so we'll help you compile that too. So and then definitely by March 15th we'll have some information there.  So I think that's part of the launch. That would be in the controls part. So like launching policies, procedures first and then controls would be the next around how to gather that information, but you guys have already started gathering it.  So it'll be a little bit easier for you there. So that's the thinking around that. Yeah. All right. Sounds good.

11:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  So from now we'll just get an email from you guys saying that I have access to the platform and then I'll be able to look into it.

11:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so like in the February, I'm thinking around February 7th, you guys will have created the instance for you, but before then I'm going to like try this week or like tonight I'm going to create a Slack channel and ideally we can just like start moving like documents or kind of communication because I know we have a few on email but it's good to have it on Slack and in that it just like to provide, I would say like even like something like if you want to put in like the like copy and paste what that investor said so we know which policies they're talking about so then we can create some for you or like whichever you had one policy before that you were creating stick it in there anything that we have just so that's a central location and then we can edit it for you and just say okay are these the policies you want in your tool?  In our tool there's also an option to create your own policy but I think it's kind of nice when you look into the tool then you'll see something that you recognize but or we can just give you a generic you know tool and then you can create  your own policy and copy and paste it in there and rename it, that's also a possibility but I think it's also nice to just like go into it and see something you recognize.  And in terms of like the transparency after you guys have done some things for that, right, Yeah, we have one, ours is up in our website and I'm going to start drafting the one for this year.

12:24 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  This is June 30th, I'm not mistaken.

12:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, because we also in our S, like for Streis and another company, we're doing the S in like, you know, because we have ES and G, so the S is around the Norwegian Transparency Act, so we can also help you in terms of like the deployment part because a lot of companies for transparency actually only have the policy, they don't have the actual implementation evidence, and we can help you with that as part of this pilot agreement so that you would have the S part in it done.  like anything, yeah, so like any kind of policies on that, you could put that into the Slack too so we can see and then we can add that.  to the S part of the policy, you know, one or the communication and then also part of the controls because there should be some actions in terms of how you manage your supply chain so we could also see how you did that last year and then we can also incorporate it into the process for this year too so we can set up another time around the S.

13:18 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah, that'll be great.

13:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I worked on the transparency act last year and we didn't have much, honestly.

13:29 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah, I talked to a few customers like that too.

13:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They're like, yeah, we posted something on our website and we have like policy but a lot of them didn't actually do the implementation part of it.  They just kind of put it on the policy so we can help with that part because that actually matches quite well with the supplier portion, the third party portion that so after after policies, procedures, trainings, then we launch controls and then the next one is third party.  And that third party section works really well with the transparency act and that should be done before your deadline before June anyway.  it works out. So you can kind of get that covered through our tool.

14:03 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  right. Awesome.

14:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

14:05 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Great. Okay.

14:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Anything else then, I think? I don't have anything. It was very clear.

14:14 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Okay. Is there anything on your side?

14:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, I think it was very clear on the next steps and how hello everyone.

14:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now we move forward.

14:25 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah. Okay.

14:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Great. Okay. Well, then I'll leave you guys and then, oh, yeah, sorry.

14:30 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  I just wanted to say that it's Carla, Zach, and then Beth.

14:36 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  you have Beth?

14:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm not sure I have Beth's email, but I'll open, I'll open up Slack, like either maybe because we're leaving or like we're leaving this meeting early.  I might have in the 15 minutes to set up the Slack and then I can buy you guys to it and then you can invite Beth and give me her email.

14:51 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  There.

14:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Great. All right.

14:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much, guys.

14:56 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  Thank you. Thank you.

14:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Have a good day, guys.
