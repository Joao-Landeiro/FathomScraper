0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hello, my daughter has a dentist appointment so I will drive her there and sit and do the meetings from that to the appointment.

0:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let me show, so just opening the whole Miro thing, but I've tried to do that, breaking down the questions from each regulation kind of thing and I think we've got something usable to begin with.

0:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And Yvonne, you feel that like you need to, like I would say the launch takes priority Yvonne, so if you feel like you need to do stuff or debug and like feel free to drop off Yvonne and Brighton and I can take this first one.

0:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know how you're feeling about the launch, Yvonne. Are we on track?

1:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, you can't hear.

1:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear us? You can hear me right now. I can hear you Okay, so let me show you something that I put together on a spreadsheet.

1:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Can you share my screen? I was trying to follow you. I'm in the link that you said. Oh, yeah.  thing is a little bit different.

1:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Let me explain to everyone what we're looking at.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I've asked, I've asked the perplexity, I like perplexity because there's a lot of sources and stuff like that.  I've asked perplexity to give me all the questions from each of these three things. CSRD, ISO 14000 and ISO 300001, right?  And then I tried, I asked it to relate them to each other to see if by answering a question on one of them we would have already something done for another thing, right?  And when it says base question, it means that the question comes from the thing itself. And so this one is about CSRD, right?  And then we can see that some of them are more related than others. This view, it's impossible to go through this entire thing, but this view is still a bit more generic because the questions are a bit more granular.  Right? So these are questions.

3:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  the CSRD questions, because those aren't questions that CSRD, but when did you get those questions? Because CSRD has a large Excel and then it has like all these different data points that your source report to.  But when did you get this part?

3:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can find the source.

3:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because I think like, okay, but maybe you could talk about the overarching things. thought like, you know, it's a double materiality and then it says ISO 14,001 and ISO, whatever, don't have it, but they have a risk assessment and you could use like a very similar methodology of the double materiality as a risk assessment and you could check off all of them.  So they might not call it a double materiality within ISO, but you do require like a risk assessment. So yeah, so yeah, and maybe this is like closer to, yeah, the mapping of those.

3:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but so Yvonne, can you hear me, Yvonne? I can, I can.

4:01 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  had some issues with teams and our position.

4:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's okay. So that's an important question because I think it is bounded by the technical aspect. So the thinking behind this was, for now we can create forms and it's relatively easy to just create forms as they are, right?  But as we move through it, eventually we realize that it's going to become very cumbersome to very specific forms for everything.  And there's probably a way of just generating forms by stacking questions. Would this make sense? Where are you getting it?  What are you getting it?

4:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think it's, so like I, because now that's always been my, like my vision is like you take ISO 14001 or ISO 37001 and every step of  those match with an ESRS data point and I can show you here. Maybe I should have shared this presentation.  Let's discuss the mental model of this. so there is like, but I know, but I think I need to show it to you because that shows you this is from the regulation itself.  So you understand how the regulation is actually set up and might help you with your mental map in that and it's an Excel file.  So you might enjoy that since you like Excel and spreadsheets and stuff. oh, no, that's not the right one.  Here, I guess, ESRS right here, right?

5:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is the index, like these are all of the different topic points within ES and G here.

5:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then each one of these ESRS two, there's like points and paragraphs. And then they say some are data points and some are narratives.  And it goes through each of these different ones, right? ESRS two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and then G one.  And there's only one G, but this maps out with ISO 37001. So when they say you need to report on this as through the regulation, is that you need to find through your double materiality which of the ones are most important.  So then you map out, then you do it, and then you report on those points. So you don't have to report on all of these points.  It's the ones that you think are most material. So that's why I was thinking once we get ISO 14001 down and understand what are the actual control points that we've decided that are most material, then you can map it to these different ones and say, OK, we're going to report on G1-1.  Because we, like, description on how to integrate relationships with suppliers, taking account risks and supply chains, impact, and sustainability matters.  It's a narrative. So our whole third-party risk management section will solve G1-215A, because we have taken into risk, doing a risk mitigation of these are top 30 that we're going to do and then we're going to actually, and then taking account risks and then we actually do that.  So, like, You know, so, like, you know, amount paid for lobbying associations or expenses or in find political contributions, right?  So, like, as part of our tool, it could be, like, have you done any political contributions, collect the information and then we report G dash one dash one.  You know, this is what we've done, right? So this is kind of how it is. So there is some, like, on climate change, water resources.  We're probably not going to have biodiversity based on what we have or even pollution. So, like, you know, some of it is like disclose whether the target relates to the prevention of air pollution's emissions of water.  So some of this, like, scope one and two that we're looking at will come out like percentage total of emissions of pollution water at risk.

7:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right. So then it's like, okay, we found it's important we collected the information in ISO 14,001 and that maps to e to e dash four.

7:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I eventually would like to have like a mapping of everything that we do.

7:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So then when when you go to the reporters section, it just pulls all of that and then kind of maps it to the ESRS requirements.  Does that make sense?

7:58 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like. Yeah, yeah, it makes sense, but so yeah right here like presented the location based scope to emissions as of year, right?  So like absolute total amount of green house emissions. Okay. Then we report so we're reporting it as ISO 14,001 as a control to be able to get the ISO 14,001 certification, but it's also a control that can be used to say like, okay, well, this is what we do for CSRD ESRS because we're actually mapping this and here's the number that we can report on.  Yes, yes, I understand that the point is this is why I was asking from the technical perspective.

8:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So even my thinking is if we collect answers to the forums and the answer is related to the forum, right?  And maybe I'm wrong, you can correct me please. If the answer is connected to the forum and we have a forum that asks five questions and one of those questions is related to another regulation that happens on another forum.  Right. Is it harder to connect these things?

9:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Okay.

9:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ideally, it would be a form.

9:12 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Ideally, a form is related to only one thing, ideally. But if the requirement is that each question is related to something else, then we need to redo how we do forms.

9:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's like- That's what I was pointing to.

9:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Yeah.

9:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then each question is actually its own entity.

9:30 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Apparently, each form is its own entity. So each form is for itself, and it has some rules, some questions, answers, blah, blah, blah, the stuff.  But if we want to do this, then we have to change it to be a granular, which would then be each question is its own entity.  We have to store it that way, create it that way, and then group it on the forms, and it makes things more complex.  I would say much more complex, to be honest. On the first glance, now that I hear it, yeah. Okay, okay.

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's not decide on anything yet. Let's just export things because I understand that the way we are building things now, if we change to this, that's a big mess.  let's not move into all these forms.

10:13 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. What I'm worried about is that with that, also that approach we'll be losing with this library that we are using and that library gives us a survey builder out of the box really quickly.  So if we go in that way with things questions specific, then we need to find the way how users can create their own questions, which can sound simple at first, but then things start to add up.  So first, it's just a text of the question with some answers, yes, no, or multiple select, then you have radiobots, then you have long text, then you have dependencies, then you have things required or not required question, and start to get complex real quickly.  So yeah, I try to avoid it if we can. But of course, that's the requirement, that's the requirement. But didn't we do something like with Telunar with each question?

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  and then we're able to pull with like a Power BI and then we're able to connect.

11:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, we did but it was a mess and we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that.  Yeah, it's it we had some some so we had everything the same as we do now but then in the telomers talk we had some specific key names for the question so each question had a specific name.  Like a section like a section with the questions and something that you didn't even see in the in the UI but we had it behind the scenes and then based on that prefix some kind of a word we did some logic but that's not good.  That's not maintainable over long time and it's a bit tricky so I to avoid it.

11:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  about AI like later on because one of the ones I was talking with one of like our pilot customers and he was talking about reporting because he was like I want to map the reporting and then he was saying I get a lot of questionnaires from investors asking me for all these different things.  Why can I just take the data from your platform and then like use AI to kind of match the answers into you know the questionnaires.  And that might be like a next up solution of that. We keep it the forms, but then we do some kind of AI matching around that that goes into that possibly.  I don't know. It just came up more recently in that conversation. I was talking to Mustafa about it, but yeah, but I don't know what is easier like trying to train an AI for that, or is it actually better to build our systems?  Like you're saying, Chao, terms of each one.

12:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Probably we don't need to train an AI for that. We can just use like some open source model with the reasoning capability and do it as a batch task.  every night it just runs and checks your reports and just pulls out the questions inside of the form and individualizes the question.  That's a, I think that's a very good use of AI actually. So maybe we would be safe on that.  Okay, so this question is just for me to close the loop. It's not me insisting on a technical solution, okay?  Question. In an hypothetical scenario where a form is a compilation of individual questions, each question with its own ID and stuff like that.  In this hypothetical scenario, we would not be able to use the form builder that we have right now, correct?  Yeah, correct.

13:20 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Or we will have to have a modified in which we would probably run into some issues. So we've had to run to our own form building, yeah.

13:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which is not something we want for sure. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if we have time, then that's fine. Is there no like plug-in form builder?  feel like a lot of companies have have it, yeah. Well, yes, we are using it, so that's the thing.

13:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There's no like more advanced form builder plug-in, like even...

13:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one is advanced, but the issue is that basically the whole point of form builder is to output some kind of, it just gives it like a JSON structure.

13:54 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  As an output, and then you show and render that as a form, and that's how it works. It has its own rules and stuff which...  very good. The library we're using is really flexible. We can change design and it has a bunch of logic you'll see probably once we start doing it, but this what we are asking is question based and we could investigate a bit more on the forms library, but I think we did that before we even started using this one.

14:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  in that case, it feels to me that the way to solve the problem of addressing individual questions is doing like AI post processing, which is...  If we can, yeah. I don't think it's as complex as it used to be as an expert, but it seems that these things are moving so fast that we could probably have some batch or no thing that just goes through the PDFs and outputs things.

14:46 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, in theory we could have something, so basically did I understood correctly, we just want to map our questions to some kind of other entity in our database, like either category or ISO.

14:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'd say it's not completely impossible. Oh, so our questions will always have inside of a single form.

15:03 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Each question has a unique identifier, which is a string, usually like a name descriptive. That's up to us. And we can always have a table that maps that name to some kind of category and that way we could connect it.  But I would really, really, really be careful with us doing too much with those mappings and stuff because these things get complex really quickly.  And the problem with that is it becomes hard to maintain over time and then we are in a mess.

15:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  An example is telling our stuff.

15:31 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  yeah, we have some crazy logic there to support their logic inside of this survey builder, blah, blah. Let's not get into that.  But it is possible and I don't think it's that crazy to have.

15:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, individually addressable questions.

15:46 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So there's levels to this, right?

15:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  First level. Individually addressable questions is something that is within reach. A lot of business rules like if this question is this thing, then show this question.  These are more complex.

16:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes, and that's the problem there is if you have a custom server builder that users can use, then they create their own service with their own names.  So we cannot have our business changing depending on if question A is true, then do something because user might overwrite question A with question something.

16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Then the logic is not any more consistent.

16:22 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So we have to be careful about that part. If the users won't be able to change the build their own service, then we don't have a problem at all.  Then we can have our own custom logic, but I don't think that's the goal here.

16:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes a lot of sense to me what you're saying. I have a feeling that there's many ways of customizing questions like on one hand, they do it alone and they make all the mistakes that people make when they create forms.  On the other end, we don't let them do it at all. These are two extremes. I'd be loved. Yeah.  I think this is important also for her because I'm just about to put a new link for a meetings Google meet because I love Google meet doesn't fail on me.  Yeah, I hate Microsoft. So it's not working.

17:17 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  That's my case.

17:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not personal. I'm not against leaving Microsoft. don't want work there.

17:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we think we need to.

17:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, I'm fine with this.

17:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm just having some problems.

17:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Today and yesterday and these last couple of days I'm I know it's that's all I think it's the same way.

17:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, designers and developers.

17:38 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  They do love Microsoft.

17:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I drop a link to? Yeah, I'll let it do it.

17:43 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, drop it in here. Okay. See you.

17:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's the chat.

17:46 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  See you later.

17:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank So cozy, your office, nice. That's when you know you've won, like when your office looks like you're leaving room, you've made it, okay, so perfect.  So we were just discussing like levels of customization. On one level, we let them do anything they want, which is very flexible, but also very dangerous.  On the other one, we don't let them do anything at all, which is rigid, but safe, right? And there's probably something in the middle.  What I'm thinking for something in the middle is that maybe the way they do a customized questionnaire is that they need to.  direct to fortify the people of fortify to build the questionnaire right not to develop this not work for is not to make you guys crazy but just like let's design this thing before leaving you to create questions in the system right because to me this is a little bit like notion like you can do anything on notion but you can really make a mess and get lost and give up on it right and all of these tools that are very customizable they have a high complexity cost people need to spend time to learn them and people don't spend time to learn them and then people make  systems and then they say that the problem is notion the problem is not notion the problem is that you didn't set up notion right so i think that if we give users too much flexibility to create your own forms like alone on their own i think we're opening ourselves to this kind of thing i think it's useful to allow them to have their own forms but maybe they don't create their own forms we help them do that  How do you guys do? How do How Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. firms for sure, for sure, and they will start sending people forms for a sign up for the Christmas party and people get emails from 45 Christmas party.  And it's not good for the brand, I think. So I really, really agree with Ivan on this. And I think again, we come to a point of ICP, like what's the ICP for this because they have technical demands.  And another point that I think is maybe a way for us to navigate complexities. Okay, let's say they are a really big company and they want to pay the big bucks and they want to have the power to customize things.  I would consider the idea of a hybrid service, which is, I think we've spoke about this when we said customer success on a previous conversation, Abby.  Oh, you're really big, you pay a lot, but we sit with you and we design this thing together. But we make sure that they even get like wide go of service, right?  They get their own forms. But they are not free to get their own forms in the wrong way, right?  Ideally, I still prefer no customization at all, but since the big ones will want some level of customization, let's at least contain the damage and do it with them, not just give them the keys to the castle.  Let's Yeah Hmm Yeah Oh I'm sorry. can take care of it. Sorry. Go ahead. You
