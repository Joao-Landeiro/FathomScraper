0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello. Hello. Hello. Now we're talking. Yes.

0:04 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Did we do it? Oh my gosh.

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's up? It's it's it's changed the the angle of the the camera.

0:15 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, I so it's funny. I like design, right? I like interior design. I could tell and I I move my furniture like every two weeks and I keep going like why why am I doing this?  What I realized is I'm I had the wrong goal. My goal is to make the room look good. That's not the purpose of this room.  The purpose of this room is to have a sensible zoom conversation and light kept getting in the camera. And so I think I finally was like, okay, I've got to accept the reason for this is to be in zoom.

0:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so I'm

1:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's both ways, but you looked better than when it was facing the nonline. Okay, you know, I'm actually trying out.

1:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, this broke. One of my improvised think-of-the-jigs just came in good.

1:15 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So I'm experimenting with a game-face thing.

1:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you see, I'm wearing a dress shirt. That's very curious, yeah.

1:21 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  thank you.

1:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I created... No, yes, yes. Because I was talking to some friends over the weekend, a very good friend live, and we were talking about the whole thing of...  I've mentioned our conversation and I said, yeah, the game-face and getting ready and putting on the, you know, the suit.  And my friend that did work in sales for a while, he told me, hey, you had the same thing.  doesn't matter if it works from home, you would, you know, the act of... Putting the the buttons together and I was like an experiment to that And I'm gonna say I mean this is just a second day But I think I could change the way I I caveat myself for instance Let's see.

2:18 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Let's see because I tend to caveat myself quite a bit Well, I tell you my grandma's line on that because my grandma She was not a proud woman, but she always took care to look good Uh-huh and she always said It's important to dress well because it makes you sit like an adult and I thought wow What a crazy grandma type thing to say because she'd sit like on the edge of her chair Up, you know, that was what she was doing.  mean, it's kind of amazing. So Before we jump in can I share some stuff with you out? I love to just need okay, because I'm like I've gone nuts with the stuff This is one of the best books  right in the past year. It's so good. It's the principle you told me about things changing it from paces.  By slaying, But this is the founding book from that. I haven't read it.

3:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I went to the lecture.

3:13 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I think you showed me a lecture on it or I went to a lecture on it. And they mentioned Stuart Brand.  He was the guy who started the lecture foundation. And this was his the formula book at the bottom of it.  He got from architecture the idea that the inside of a building and the site plan of the building and the like interior design, they all change at different paces.  That's where the idea came from. So cool. So then you got me into this one.

3:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, we have the same version. Yeah. Well, you told me to get it. So I bought it right when you said and I liked that.

3:53 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  mean, he's using specific examples, but it actually feels like he's doing in abstractions, you know, and What really stuck out to me was when he said the way you would design an Indian town, and the way you would design a tea kettle, they are the same type of problem.  And that's like an amazing statement because then you go, oh, I guess there's a way to think about like what lies within a problem like the solution lies within the design of the problem.  You know, like, does that make sense? Yes, yes, yes.

4:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like that sentence, if I had an hour to solve a problem would use 15 minutes to define the problem, something like that, right?  Right.

4:38 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And so, yeah, so I've just absolutely loved, especially the pace layering thing, but this one's good. he also wrote Christopher Alexander as the guy who wrote a pattern language.  You probably knew that, guess. I haven't read it.

4:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, I know the texture textbook that a lot of stuff.

5:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  for developers like. And then last thing, and I have to take this jacket off because it's too hot. But there's a book from 1938 called Functions of the Executive by Chester Bernard.  And it's like a theoretical treatment of what it means for people to work together and how you help with that.  And this is the key line from it that I remember. The exquisite art of executive decision-making consists in this, knowing which decisions I will make, which decisions others will make, which decisions are ready to be made and which decisions must be delayed.  I mean, that's my paraphrase. like, do you see, he's like making distinctions about suitability of information and. responsibility. That's how he's thinking of work and I thought, wow, that's an amazing thought.  And then he has an essay in the back. It's a lecture he gave called The Mind in Everyday Affairs.  And he explains the connection between what he simply terms logical and non-logical functions of the mind. And his argument is that in the West, people love the logical, but that if you actually analyze most people's logic, it's faulted.  It's faulty. And he says most of the work we do is done by non-logical process. And so how can we get better at that?  It's just a really very interesting book. So that's that's some of what I have here. Thank you.

6:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It tickled all my nerves, Glenn. Yeah, yeah, you're like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. So, you seem to be in a good mood.  I'm glad to be here with you.

7:03 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  That's the point.

7:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the same, but I think you are in a good mood because other good things are happening as well.

7:10 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  mean, I was the anything cool happening in the work front that some I'm realizing so this will sound I'm realizing that the most important question I need to answer for for me at least about work isn't is where physically where am I because I spend a lot of time thinking about what should I be doing or how should I be doing it but the truth is whenever I'm in the right physical location I always know what to do immediately.  I don't I don't have an issue with that and in fact I waste a lot of time thinking what occurred to me this week was that my office which I like is  at for rest and administration. And it's not actually where my work takes place. And that means I have to go visit my clients more because when I'm with them, I'm doing the right things.  Yes. I'm not, I'm in my head. And so a big part of what I've been doing for these projects is I say, I learned this from real estate development.  Put it in a box and keep it in a box. So I say, all right, these are all the meetings we're going to have from here to the end of the project.  Here's what they will all cover. If you don't miss a meeting, we'll be fine. It's almost like a budget, but for a project.  And I learned that just because if you want to construct a building, that is how you have to do it.  But it's failing me because people are missing meetings or we're missing context from the meetings and I'm going, what's the issue?  And the issue is. I picked the wrong kind of meetings to have. They're not Zoom meetings. They're me at their offices filming them.  That's what that is. So if I'm not on the phone with a vendor or a client, and if I'm not in their office, like I should tell myself I'm actually not really working on client stuff right now.  Me sitting here is not client work, which I'm recognizing.

9:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like the young kids say I vibe with that. Yeah, yeah. There's this guy and I mean, this is the thing about our conversations.  They all like we want to like share something. But there's this guy that has an interesting idea. He has like a computer table and a paper table.  Yes. Yes.

9:48 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  In the same room, right? And I was like, oh, I need that, I need that.

9:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because right now I have everything table. Any kind of thing you might want, it exists on this table. And I don't think that's a good thing.  but anyway um that's cool computer and paper i've tried to do that but i don't have enough space do that but i believe in it yeah i think i'm going to have a smaller computer table yeah half of what it is right now yeah and yeah let's see but let me share you the the link to the mirror and all that good stuff and i'm sorry i for some reason these guys who wanted to meet last week they also could meet at the same time this week and that's why i sent you the reschedule link because that's just what they can do oh don't worry about that actually the thing is i mean it's very much fine that we move things around the thing was that the way google calendar was showing that to me was that nate wants to change something about it but he didn't tell me what it was unless i opened it yeah and then when i opened it oh i i could make it so yeah we understand each other yeah it's fine oh man this is looking cool all right keep going okay so this is uh the link  Right you'll see it on the on the chat if you want to join in his mesozoic your company Yeah, that's great.  Yeah Thank you. Thank you. I think Yeah, just it feels scientific and funny at the same time. Yeah, yeah, it's it's really cool Okay, thank you.  So, okay, let's do a quick recap So the first thing we did on our first conversation was mostly around like your own perspective, right?  Both in terms of life and your craft. Yes. What is the password? Sorry to interrupt you. It's Nate Nate Okay, yeah, I'm in And So we did that and then I can pull you to me.  Do you want me to pull you to me? Yeah, I I did it. So from that we try to extract the main concepts about it and try to  organize them in these four buckets. And the buckets are infinite, as you know. And then we tried to pick places where to focus on, right?  And there were a few. One of the ideas that was really interesting was the Saturday stuff and the Monday stuff.  And we discussed your skill, it's more than a skill, but it's called your mode, your advantage, your thing. Like this capacity for listening and how that connects to the sense of calling or what you're doing here.  We spoke about the jazz in terms of making peace with that idea that structure is not the answer for everything, but we sometimes think it is, and there's what  of dancing around that. And we spoke also about like this, your terrible relatability, like this capacity you have, which relates to the listening, right?  And the looking for the materials for your art came across as a Saturday thing, but I feel that it might be actually the inner thing that powers all the other motions which just for living in a society kind of purposes, kind of put in a Saturday box.  Okay. And then we started taking a look at the process view, And this is kind of how we need to work because we were kind of figuring out that there's the first half and the second half.  And the first half was a lot about collecting information from clients. Yep. And that was a little bit more  Formal ache is not the right word, but it's more process-oriented like there's things you do to to collect that information Yeah, and then when it came to the habit formation and the change management It was a little bit.  We were starting to realize. Okay. This is a little bit more Go to put into a box there might be a box there might not be a box there might be just principles or heuristics, right?

14:24 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  but That's where we left off Yeah, any specific thing that this brings to your mind Um in the note turbo-related ability, I would also add the word astuteness Astuteness is the word aerostatic uses not not acuity.  So instead of aerostatic You could put stuteness or yeah instead of acuity.

14:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah A Stuteness feels something of a fox But I don't know how it is in, like, your culture, but in my culture, Foxes are like smart cunning, right?  But they're not necessarily evil. They're not wolves. They're just doing kind of the, what's the name, mischievous? Yeah, I'm very, well, who I am as a person is very mischief-oriented.

15:22 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay. I like to do pranks.

15:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you did mention the pranks, true, true. Okay.

15:30 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I think the only other thing that comes to mind is I think that as I'm seeking to help other people do what I'm doing, I really could teach them how to do the first half if they have the listening skills.  And I think in time I can teach them how to do the second half, but right now I haven't done enough of it.  So I don't. I know, I trust I would do it well when I'm in those moments, but I don't have enough.  reference memories to create heuristics out of it. For the first half I do, I've just done a lot of that.  So that's all that came to mind. Got it. So let me make a quick note on that.

16:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because one of the things that I believe that, I will change the position of this. Pitch. Yeah. But the word pitching is an interesting one.  Is that,

17:01 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Is that a product for you teaching us to do this or is this more about in building and Part of me is realizing I think what this business might be is a franchise Okay, because I don't want to build it as a business and have employees and do all that stuff I just want to be like a guy out doing it like an inventor But I have people I know who I trust who if I was an inventor and I came and gave them like hey This works if you do it this way they could build a franchise business out of it And I have right now who would buy the franchise.  I have two people who would oh, that's so soon It's just it's just so I Don't want to put the cart before the horse, but that's just Where I am I mean I'm telling people about it and they're like I would like to purchase, you know I want to have that And it's similar to this company called

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  EOS entrepreneurial operating system that it would be a similar type of franchise like an intellectual capital franchise No, yeah, right Okay, given that Should we Start to draft plenty shapes and two by twos and stuff like that.  Yeah. Yeah, okay One of one of the easiest ways I think we can begin is Compressing this thing right?  Yeah. So now it's the time of the process to where it is starts get less organized Yeah, that's pretty but more alive Yeah Opening the mural here Yes, yes  So I'll be orbiting a little bit between these two zoom levels, and I know it sometimes can get a little bit dizzying, so feel free to just, you know, take your thing.  So at the very basic level, one thing we have is that we have two phases. Understand, change, okay. And now if we zoom in on the understand, we know that the understand as shape the work.  Scope. It is actually what people ask all the time, right? How do you work? What's the thing? Conceitification, structures, views, OK.  And on the change, we still don't have a lot of a process view. But maybe we have a bit of tell me a little bit more about how you think about this change management motions, right?  Yeah, so it's very focused.

20:39 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's on the seat. Nine. I show you the nine influences of performance, right? You've mentioned it. I don't know that we've brought it here.

20:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll show it to you.

20:56 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah. Because. I'm assuming that whatever needs to happen, whatever new habit needs to happen is not happening for one of these nine reasons.  So let me share my screen with you. This is from an enormous study that Proctor and Gamble did. It's basically if you're not getting the job done, the number one reason by far is the person was not clear on what they needed to get done.  Then these two through nine are in no particular order. They're not actually prioritized. So it could be you have the wrong person or they just don't have a job they need.  they just need to be taught how to do the thing. They just need a little feedback. You get this.  But my belief is that it's one of these reasons is why the habit isn't taking place. I have to discern which one and then create a solution based on the reason.  So some of these, the solution is just simply truth telling. Like if they're the wrong person for the job, I've got to go tell them or tell their boss, like, I don't know if they have the aptitude to do the job.  If they need like a checklist, you know, because they're going to these events 200 times a year and they're not packing the bags correctly, I can physically make and print out and laminate a checklist and put it on their travel bag.  That's like a job. So that's how I'm thinking about the habit change. Now what's critical though is, and I can send that.  you want that?

22:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I would love to put it in the inside of the mirror. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me put that in here.

23:08 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  What I know though is I can't just come up with a solution and then like force people to use it.  The solution has to be sold internally. And so what I've learned is I go to whoever needs to change their behavior and I have what I call a discovery meeting with them.  So I just ask them what issues are you having and I you know exactly what I've taught you to do you know and they tell me their issues and then I can say if I could show you how to solve that issue would you want to see it and then I come back with the solution that I'm I build a solution based off of what I learned from the company that will help the the other employee do their job differently.  Does that make sense like? It could be a checklist. It could be a training portal. It could be feedback.  But that's the idea. Yes.

24:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it doesn't make sense. just make sure I capture it right. Could you retrace that role play? you go to the person that needs to change?  How is that? Yeah.

24:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So the first thing I do with change management, I'm always talking about people, right? Who is the person that's not getting the job done?  And then I just go to them and truly in a spirit of humble inquiry, that's an Ed Shein phrase, I say, what issues are you having?  And I let them tell me what issues they're having. And then I actually go away and think about, okay, what will help them, right?  I'm not trying to force them to do it the way their boss wants. I'm trying to help them. I'm assuming they want to do a good job.  And I'm assuming there's some kind of a gap between what the boss wants and what their getting done. And most of the time it's role expectations.  a lot of the value of what I'm doing usually is saying we are looking exactly for these kinds of things.  This is the behavior, this is almost like our social contract with each other. So I'm documenting the process, not because I don't think they're like they're too stupid or don't understand it, simply for the sake of clarity.  This is what it's asked for. So interview the person of their need, propose a solution to them, check in if it's working.  Okay. For some reason I'm having trouble sharing a document with you. Oh, I can maybe I can just drop it in the mirror board.  I believe so. I believe you can.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I just dropped it right there, kind of on the middle of your thing.

26:03 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Sorry. There it is.

26:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  see it? Perfect. Yes. So I'll copy it and put it on starting resources. Yeah, but I also also copy it and put it next to us.  Oh, yes. Yeah, there you go.

26:39 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So basically, the idea is I become a salesperson internally. But I'm not I'm not selling them a pre-made product.  I'm trying to design a product that they would buy. know, like that's the whole Peter Drucker, Ted Levitt thing, create a customer, like literally create a new customer by creating a product that they wanted, but didn't know they wanted.  Uh-huh. That's where that's coming from. Okay.

27:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So create customer. Is a customer for the change? Yeah. Yeah.

27:38 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And it's a customer for whatever knowledge product I'm going to make. know, so for example, with blue Delta jeans, they're frustrated right now.  The guys running all the events feel like the owner is unhappy with them and he is in a way, but he's a good guy.  And he feels like they're not running their events consistently. So what I need to do is figure out, like, okay, what can I do to help them run their events consistently, and then sell both the owner and the employees, like, guys, this is what we're going to do.  And I think the solve is going to be, we all co-create while I'm down in Mississippi, what a good event looks like.  I facilitate a day-long session, and that's what we do. We're all like, that's a good event. And if everyone can agree that's a good event, then I'm like, okay, so you're saying you will do this every time, right?  Yes. Or else what? Like, what happens if it goes well? What happens if it doesn't go well? how do we make a believable plan to start doing this?  Does that example make sense? Mm-hmm.

28:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm, yes.

28:54 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I mean, I think a lot of what I'm doing is similar to people who get luxury closets installed. You know, like, you hire someone, they come in, they learn how you work, what clothes you have, and they spend a ton of time and they get everything organized so that it's really easy to hang up your clothes in the right place and enjoy wearing them.  That's what I'm doing. People could do this for themselves, but they lack the perspective and the time, so I'm coming in from the outside and getting things organized for them, that their life feels easier and more enjoyable to be a part of.

29:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I know that you use this phrase and then you change it quickly, but I think it is really powerful.  Great, perfect to change. Yes.

29:45 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah.

29:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I think it helps also to position your company as, I mean, what's different than you guys, right? I think it's a very common complaint from people that, ah, the consultants come and.  They make a couple of cookie cutter recommendations, and I think this phrase spoke to me. Yeah.

30:12 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, and it also fakes into my pricing, because what I'm realizing is I think my pricing needs to be for a year, six-month engagement, or I think a year is too much for people.  I think it's a six-month engagement minimum, because that's a much more truthful way to talk about what's going to happen.  Like the way I sold it so far, the one month for 15 grand, it's not true. It won't work in a month.

30:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Six months, you can get something done. Okay, so let's role-play these a little bit. Yeah. it. Let's say that, just to explain my mental model here, I'm putting like a wish list at the bottom and then when we have something to begin, I'll change the color and put it up.  And also of not using the model. So let's role play this. I hire you, I run, is that a specific, is usually related to manufacturing?

31:39 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I can't say usually right now because, sure. mean, we could say that. mean, that's my target is going to be niche engineering companies because that's where a lot of the knowledge is getting lost right now.  Like, municipal engineers, like I'm from this small And this is how all of the plumbing under the ground in this town works, and I'm about to retire Okay, I know I don't think you are a yet guy, but this is yet This is yet business.

32:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is yet yet?

32:14 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, yeah about people.

32:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. How do you yeah?

32:18 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, yeah. Well, no. Yeah, you can say however you want, but I say yeah Yeah, yeah, no, it's a huge deal man.

32:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's very very cool. Yeah, okay So I made a note here on on the on my paper that okay, so I I have I run a Plumbing company that is doing not like one but like this municipal wastewater process.  Yes, correct. Yeah. Yeah, and the the plant has been running for 40 years. It has some quirks and some Fixes that only makes sense for the people that were there when they were made And these people are closing  in on retirement. And I don't want to have like an ecological disaster when they leave. So I call you and I say, hey, Nate, I'm really afraid that Bob knows everything around here and Bob is about to retire.  Can you help us? Is this kind of how it goes? Yeah. Okay. And so you follow this process, generally speaking, in a sense.  you shape the work, scope, you start talking to people, not just Bob, not just me, like people, and then you extract some patterns from it, some observations.  These observations, please interrupt me. These observations might point towards like assumptions or blind spots or stuff like that. And then you make a more organized approach into those sources of knowledge, and you run structured interviews, right?  And the structured interviews, the output of them is opportunities for improvement? What's usually the thing?

34:09 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, the one that I know I have always is that they have their own portal to Fathom, and they can search for any of the answers.  So at least it's captured. Like, that scratch is the edge of, like, we're so scared that Bob's going to leave, at least we have it captured.  But that doesn't actually put it into practice. The two things that are needed are an onboarding playbook, like an onboarding training for the new Bob.  And then the other thing is like a custom thing. I have to create a customer for the change, and that means product development.  I have to figure something out that's going to make that knowledge be useful to another person. And it may mean I try to help them hire an apprentice.  You know? And there's a recruiting side to this, but my goal is not to like have a widget that I sell, it's to solve the problem for them, which is when Bob leaves, you can't have your company fail.  That's working on.

35:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I assume that at this stage of your company, we are out of the role play now, at this stage of your company, we're still trying to run more repetitions to see what this usually means.  We understand the intention of it. Yeah, I haven't proven this.

35:40 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  You know, the thing that makes me feel hopeful is that at every company I've ever worked at as an employee, I've always been doing this.  I didn't realize what I was doing, but like I would make Wikipedia's of like, what is this actual marketplace look like?  why do we do it? too and like I'd map out the networks in the yellow pages and so I was always doing it but and I know it works because I would use it as reference material all the time um but I've not done it for a client yet and that's part of like just to go up a level that's why it's like man it's tough with the franchise thing because people want to come in and buy this because they like what I'm saying but I've told them I'm like I don't have a product yet.  I just know if I'm put in a situation I will always seek to tell the truth and that will guide me to figure out what to do next and I'm smart enough or I'm not smart enough I am smart but I mean to be more specific I have a speedy enough mind and a true enough heart that I think I would do right in each situation but that doesn't mean I have a model yet mm-hmm-hmm you have a good intuition yeah okay so I understand what we're talking about here for the

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the thing. I'm just thinking of a word that will not trip us up later as being too defined.

37:07 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I think it's good to say skill will heal. Skill will heal. Basically, I figure out, do they not have the skills right now in the company to have someone besides Bob do it and then I do a skill transfer?  Do they not have the will, like the employee who should be taking the work from Bob doesn't want to do it?  Okay, well then that's their company has to have an honest conversation about staffing. Or is there a hill? Is there something in the way that makes it impossible for someone else to do Bob's shop?  Let's get that out of the way. So that's what I'm doing. Skill will heal. I'm treating one of those issues.

37:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this a model of yours?

37:57 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  No, that's from Procter & Gamble, but I can use it. I mean, it's just no, it's yeah, even the reference shows that you're serious about this.

38:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So Okay, yeah I'll put I'll suggest an expression here, you know, like change artifact Sure, yes Well, okay, hold on.

38:40 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I actually can speak to this. Go ahead.

38:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go ahead No, no, I don't love artifact because conflicts with the other ones is not mutually exclusive.

38:48 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So Well, hold on it skill the way I solve skill is All I tell people when they hire me is that I'm solving for skill And  I'm doing it in two ways. I'm either capturing, I'm making a knowledge base with Fathom Video, or I'm making an onboarding guide for both.  Okay? Okay. That's all the statement of work I give people first ever will cover. That's what I'm doing for you.  Inevitably, when I start interviewing employees, it becomes clear that there are other issues involved. If I like the company, I will propose a new statement of work to them that basically says this.  Let's shape this problem and keep me on retainer until we solve it or until we want to stop working at it.  But we have to co-create a statement of work that we both like for that. Do you see that? The only thing I want to ever commit to immediately is that I will make a knowledge base in an onboarding guide because that's simple.  Even if we don't like each other, I can fulfill it excellently and be done with the project. But if the company seems like they really value telling the truth and they want to get better, then I have a separate statement of work that's a retainer model.  I can show you what I'm doing for that for a client right now, if you want to see that.

40:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A separate rate or separate? S-E-P-A-R-A-T-E.

40:30 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I'm always amazed that you can work so well in English and you have your other languages, because it's hard enough for me to get English down.-Thank you.

40:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, show me that thing. Show me that thing.-Yeah, I'm pulling it up.

40:44 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So the basic model is... Hold on. So here's the example. This guy, he didn't hire me for what I do.  He hired me because... He has a warehouse in Detroit. Are you sharing something with me? Not yet.

41:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

41:04 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay Here's in Detroit and he needed to get it He needed to get it leased up like he wants to get clients in it and I told him I can't help you and He said well because you're telling me that that makes me feel like you could help me and I'm like And I said if you want to hire me what you really need is a commercial real estate broker But if you don't want to hire that this is what I can guarantee you.  I will make a tracker spreadsheet with you We will meet once a week. We will come up with a hypothesis for how we are going to get your space lease We will list activities.  We're gonna do that week We will then go away and do the activities and we'll come back the next week and say did it work if so Let's do more of it or if it didn't work.  Let's come up with a new hypothesis this in activities and try those and so that's what we've been doing so here's like the the trackery that's like I called common office installations I called the Detroit architects Hobbs and black you know I call Nick Emrich to introduce the furniture dealers I you know this is all this is all just like hypothesis test hypothesis test stuff that's what I'm proposing I'm stopping sharing now and I can give you that document but that's what I'm proposing I could problem-solving for people if if we have an issue besides basic skill documentation of a knowledge base and an onboarding guide you can hire me on retainer to try to solve it because I would like to try to help but we have to shape the work correctly we can't say like hey let's like have made on retainer and hope it works out we gotta say how will we know when it's like time to stop trying and how will we know when it succeeded and it either of those points  the project's over. And that's kind of like what I just showed you. mean, that's, I told the guy, I can send you the statement of work I gave him, but I told him, like, we'll do this for two months and I'm not guaranteeing any outcome.  I'm just guaranteeing that we will follow through these behaviors.

43:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I'm going to think out loud, right? Okay. For you, creating this spreadsheet was very easy, technically speaking.  Yeah. The guy was very useful.

43:37 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah.

43:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But this would be a difficult thing to sell on the first, on the first go. So it comes up.  Actually, it was your first sell to this guy. I mean, it would not generate generated demand, right? People would not ask for this.  But when they see you and they trust you, they're like, Oh, I want Nate on my side. without, you know, exuberance and crazy tools, just a real interest in getting the work done.  And we will do this together and I'll trust Nate that he's not, you know, tricking me with complexity. Right?  Correct. Okay.

44:16 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So there, I just put it there for you. And I, you know, I figured out payment terms that would work for them and, you know, all of that.  So what I'm finding is this, people are not buying Veritas, they're buying me. And whatever I'm telling people, they're just saying, yeah, sure, I'll hire you for that because I'm always telling the truth.  And if for some reason I lie or like, I don't say things as clearly or truthfully as I want, I literally come back and go, hey, I made a mistake, that's not true.  This is the truth. And it just seems like people want to hire someone who like that.

45:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have a similar sense we can put a pin on this but I think in terms of franchising that's kind of a bottleneck.

45:12 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah that's not gonna but what all I want to franchise is the knowledge base and the onboarding guide. Okay because I am antsy and like to learn and I'm always gonna want to get my hands into new stuff so that's just for me and that's not a franchise.  I would not include that in a franchise.

45:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it. Okay okay so okay let's talk about why you What makes a knowledge base a good thing, a useful thing?

46:04 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Employees spend the national average, employees spend 20% of their time looking for information. It decreases that amount of time.  The difference between cloud storage and a knowledge base is that a knowledge base is organized. Most people store all of their things digitally, but I call it the Google Drive Wasteland.  They can't find it and they don't know which version of the document is relevant. A knowledge base says, if it's in here, you'll be able to find it and it will be up today.  So I know that's helpful because I know people are looking for info, so give them a path of wish resistance to the info.

46:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A knowledge base versus... ...odd storage. What are the tenets of a knowledge base?

47:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  As the fewest amount of things in it to get the job done, so like a minimalism principle, and it's the path of least resistance to you finding your answers.  So that means it has to be faster to use it than it would be to call a coworker or pop your head over to their desk and say, how do you do this?

47:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll do you phrase that path of least resistance. the asset test of this quicker than leaning over the partition.  Yes, that's right. And asking.

48:25 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yes.

48:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. What do most people get wrong when they do a knowledge base?

48:41 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  They don't set it up in an, like, it's for customers. So you have to create a prototype and test it with customers and then tweak.  They don't do that. Most people who actually do this absolutely love structure and process. And so they way overthink it and over engineer it, and then it's not useful at all.  all because they will release an 800 page binder that no one's ever going to look at and they spent a year making.  That's not how you do this. like, you do it the way I'm talking about doing change management. You go to the people you're hoping to help and ask them their issues and then you just start solving one issue at a time with knowledge.  know, and the example I give is in knowledge management, they call this applied knowledge is like you create use version of the knowledge.  But when I was at this video company, did I tell you the example of a rush pricing for the videos?  No, I don't think so. So basically it would take about a day to turn around rush pricing for these videos we were selling.  And so I just figured out like, well, what are the factors and I made an Excel spreadsheet and I sent it to the team.  And then and then on out, we always quoted rush pricing on the call because it was like, well, okay.  It's going to be five weeks and a 90 second video with 2D animation, and I'd plug that into my spreadsheet and it spit out a number and I told them the number.  And that's the kind of thing that a knowledge base is. It's not static. Like, well, we just put it in the right file in SharePoint.  You're literally trying to solve problems with the knowledge. it may be that it's all in SharePoint or whatever. But also, if you can make that rush pricing spreadsheet, you should bookmark it and put it on your Google Chrome.  So do you see it? It's difficult because people want to make like principles and just treat it like you're designing this stagnant thing.  It's not. It's a living thing.

50:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the second it becomes static, people will start sensing that.

50:58 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And if they can't trust it, they'll stop using And so even if it's really well structured, they won't use it.  So it has to be updated all the time. And the way that I believe in that is there's this book called Two Seconds to Lean by Paul Akers.  And the idea is that the only real way to do lean is to take 30 minutes at the beginning of every day and go, how can I do my job two seconds faster from here on out forever?  It's proactive, it's thoughtful, it's before the rush of things starts. That's how I'm talking about this. And that means you need someone who has time dedicated to it.  Yes. Because employees will not do that, even though that's the right principle, unless the CEO is like, demand everyone do it, they won't do it.  So someone is full-time on staff managing this. And what I'm arguing is don't hire someone full-time, hire someone for the setup of it, and then like have them come in every three months and just do a spruce up in a maintenance.  And that's what... think the franchise could offer that I'm talking about like they have maybe five to ten clients that they just maintain the knowledge bases they've built and that's what they do.

52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so now let's create the model for dedicated versus is it outsourced outside?

52:27 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  think it's retainer you know it's like people always say fractional now but it's a vendor, vendor managed. I almost would say vendor managed because it feels like it's consistent and formal but I always hear people don't like retainers now I don't know if that's true but they feel ripped off by retainers a lot of the time.  Okay so I'll just change that.

52:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A vendor managed knowledge base. Okay, so dedicated employee, I guess, no time, first thing, right? Say it again.

53:20 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  The dedicated employee has no time, right? Yeah, I'm saying it has to be a full-time employee hired just to manage the knowledge base.  Okay.

53:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So explaining no time, I don't get it, I guess.

53:38 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay. Expensive.

53:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I wanted to put like pros and cons, yes, expensive. Expensive.

53:47 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It doesn't make sense, really, because they're going to be really busy when they set it up, and then they're not going to be busy maintaining it.  You can't really assign them other work because then they're going to get destroyed. Interacted and they'll have the same issue everyone else would have which is this doesn't become their priority anymore Yes spiky allocation, yep It's inconsistent when how much of their time is needed, mm-hmm I would say they have the inside view as well the cognitive bias of the inside view.

54:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah correct. Yeah and I would also assume that Because they're part of the system the organization as a system it's impossible that they are fully impartial Yeah, they're gonna get into that setup where You know, they don't want to lose their job and all of that mm-hmm.

54:51 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So they become more bureaucratic than truth-telling which If you're gonna do research in development, which is like what? job is.  You're going out to your employees figuring out what they need and creating knowledge products to help them. You have to be dealing with truth, dealing with bureaucracy, it's, you won't get anywhere.  You can't invent products based off of politics. I mean that's why I love that the company is called Veritas because I really think it all depends on telling the truth.  Everything. Or this doesn't work. For sure.

55:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Can I make a similar list or an opposing list on your side on the vendor management?

55:57 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Lower cost. Or you want the negatives? I think that's the bronze level.

56:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you can get to the silver level where it's not just by reading the first column, I know what I'll find on the second one, but we can begin on that.  under managed means.

56:16 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Expertise in structure knowledge.

56:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

56:23 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So they call that information architecture expertise. Mm hmm.

56:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was telling my wife about it that that expression. She was like, that's what you do. She should tell people to do that.  I'm like, I don't know. I don't think a of people know that name.

56:40 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, it's going to confuse them. I think interview skill. You have to be able to interview well, that's a journalism skill, actually.  But not only is it journalism, Matt, you need to know how to ask the right questions. You have to take very seriously privacy.  You can't tell what people told you if you're a journalist. That's not okay. You're not going to be trusted.  so there is a level of privacy that allows people to open up so that we can get to the truth so that we can solve the issues.  It's not all going to come out in the work product, but it's going to talk honestly. Vendor managed is you're going to be up to date on like, basically, if I have 10 clients and I figure out something in client number one that works better, I'm going to apply it to all 10 clients.  But that's like, I don't mean that like... expertise-wise. mean it like technologically because things are changing so quick technologically.  If you're at the update, I can shift everything over to it. Whereas if I'm just a siloed in-house person, I'm not going to find those updates.

58:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  From my understanding, you will not develop technology for the knowledge base, right? Correct.

58:22 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  But I'm saying like, if you know notebook LM can be managed really easily by just upgrading your Google Gmail account for the company.  I'm going to have you do that instead of building out a whole tool. So really quickly, I have a call in two minutes.  I'm going to call. this is, dude, I almost feel like there's, I could hire you into my clients. Like what you're doing is so valuable and I can understand that you're drawing out of me what matters.  partly I want to talk to you about the guy at Proctor Campbell, who designed their entire strategy approach when they turned the company around.  He's a friend of mine. I went to church with him for five years, and he's going to run a strategy session for Barotas, like a one-day session.  I think it would be very difficult for you to come over Zoom, but maybe you would want to just so you could be a part of his expertise.  everything you're doing here, I'd like to think with you on how I can use it as the preparation for that session, because it's all tied, and I think it would be hugely to your benefit to know this guy and interact with him.  But anyway, that's a separate thing. It's all about... I'm in. Yeah, it's all written about in this book. This is based off of everything he did.

59:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, you know this guy? The Roger Martin?

59:46 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, he brought Roger Martin into Procter & Gamble, my friend. And they knew AJ Laughley, like Zeke was the one who said, instead of just focusing on cut consumers, like the people using our soap and toilet paper,  Let's focus on our customers to like wal-mart and sam's club and so he invented customer marketing for proctor again i mean he's a really big deal.

1:00:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wow yeah i would like to meet him regardless but now i really want to miss yeah it's cool i gotta go i'm going to see you later have a nice one.  You
