0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

How about you?

1:02 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  One of the things that you will learn from me is I read a small very but important book called The Energy Bus.  Just very very simple and you know what the energy you know what the energy bus already is. It's that energy is magnetic and I learned that all it takes is that early in a conversation instead of just how are you good you just tweak it a little bit and it just changes the energy of it and I've used it for years and it's just like it just enters the conversation a whole different whole differently.  Could be remarkable, wonderful, best day ever. Doesn't matter but it gets a smile on the face and it just changes a little bit.  That's really true.

1:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean if you need a testimonial I'll give it.

1:47 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm calling it some version of digital charisma right because right here we need that extra that extra punch right and that's it but so thanks for letting me in.

2:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you, you know I okay a couple of things first to totally agree with the with a like we need to turn it to 11 on the on the calls because it takes away like I think I saw someone I don't remember her name but she said it stuck with me which was around the same thing she's like a specialist in online things events and she said you really have to be like you know more energetic because we miss so much and when he said charisma I've been thinking a lot about that in terms of like the AI doing everything and what's left for us and and I think we are about to enter like this age of charisma is even more important than it used to be is it Vanessa van Edwards by any chance that you're referencing the bit the first part on the second part the first part is no okay the second part I don't know maybe I'm sure I'm not the first to come to this

3:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  But yeah, she's a professional area and when you were saying it, it sounded like it sounded like her and I think that she has been she's a good resource for that Vanessa Ben Edwards and talking about this idea of charisma and yeah, online and being able to not not the word authentic but just be like being, being a version of you online that is like also in person but just has this flair of like humanity and just just a bit of fun.

3:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like here's the thing.

3:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Here's the funny thing about me is like I will be like this, like this ball of energy, but at the same time, not the same time, but my other the other end of the spectrum is I'll be like super stoic.  Like on calls you'll see me like if I'm in it, I'll just be stoic and nothing in between. Yeah, yeah.  I think I might do the same actually.

3:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think people that don't know me really well when I start like to throw my brow, but like getting really into it.

3:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Is it mad? No, just in the zone.

3:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yeah. You know, that's it.

4:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  That's perfect. It's no, I'm in I'm dialed in now. That's it's game time. Yeah You just had a video hold on I have to come and you just had a video the other day where you are in a boat somewhere wait I Want to go like a book on a beach, babe.  Maybe I don't know you're it looked like you were moving on water. Oh, yeah I was like, well, this is one of the best the best videos I've seen Yeah, it's So, let me tell you the story about that.

4:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I've been really frustrated with LinkedIn and I like I I Said myself a self a challenge to post every business day for this quarter And I was like, I'll not be focusing on followers I'll be focusing on keeping up with it with the habit and consistency and becoming the person that I I  of doing this right and that has been rewarding but it's very annoying that I got like 200 followers in this much time it's like and then you see like the impressions and they're really low and this is not a way to grow an account because it requires quite a bit of effort and I was like you know what screw it I'm going to start to get crazy on LinkedIn and so I did a video before that one that was I was on the beach and I made a framework from David Meister types of and people kind of reacted to it and I was like well I won't be in this place forever because I wasn't on a short holiday and said I'm going to try to get as many videos as I can and yeah I wasn't at both and I was like maybe I should make a video now and yeah but that was a really magical place because it was I don't know what's the the the name is not really a swamp it's like a thing where it goes up and the trees get submerged it's between the river

6:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  to see.

6:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No crocodiles. But yeah, lots of mosquitoes and stripes.

6:08 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Now it's good. I like this is the this is the other side of business, right? Is the nuance that we have and the the personality that we bring.  So I'm glad that I'm glad to reach out and I've I've now started to not just follow you on LinkedIn, but also your personal website is designed really well, and it's clean.  I have tried so hard. I think this back. I haven't tried so hard to design a personal website that is as clean.  But you've done it in a way that I just want to articulate is like, you've made personality, but still focused in on the business and the decision aspect.  So I just want to share I like to share feedback and and and compliments where they deserve it. And I just I think you've done a really good job and it's clean and simple and it's moved from the top down.  So thank you respect, total respect.

7:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you mean the the personal one or the company one?

7:03 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  company, well, the company one, the shaz one, the, the, I like the personal. So I've always, I've been recently trying to find this way, this way of, yes, this one.  Okay. Yes. Yes. First of all, it's the, it's a, how can we make complex expertise, it's easier to explain, right?  Just that sentence in itself, that question in itself. But you're, you definitely have skills in the design element of it and being able to see that as well, even with your, your visuals as well.  And that's what I'm saying is, is I want to compliment those that work hard and compliment those that do a good job.  So I'm telling you this right now. Thank you.

7:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. That's, that's, it made my day. I try my best.

7:43 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I try my best.

7:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  keep doing it. You keep doing it. it's, and one of the things that I remember that it's, it's nice to, you know, to find each other.  I remember when I, when I found your profile, I was like, okay, this is really specific. I think with specificity, there's a lot of courage and like betting that it's the laser focus, right?  And for me, that was very difficult. And I still think I should be more specific. But how was it for you to get like that niche because I don't have your website open right now, but I remember it was really like, oh, this is.  pricing, yeah. But pricing for strategy consulting, right? That was, yeah, yeah.

8:28 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  So I learned, I've been, I'll share this through a story. I'll share it through a story. by sharing it through a story also kind of helps me refine my messaging in a sense.  I'll share it through a story, which is I have always been in the world of strategy. Like I work at Harvard in strategy.  like, every single reading I do is always based on big picture. It's like I always try to tie it back to it.  And I've been a business strategist since I left Harvard to come and be an entrepreneur. Always. business strategist. The problem was that while I love that, everybody else is a business strategist in some sense.  And as a matter of fact, the word business strategist is confusing. Is that a brand strategist? It really actually is confusing.  But I found that in my work, I was doing a lot of price modeling and price strategy because I found that price was so deeply connected to every facet of the business that I bought it just under a year ago.  I finally said, well, why don't I just reposition what I do, but not change anything that I actually do?  And I was a business strategist who did pricing and now I'm a pricing strategist who really looks at pricing from the business strategy lens.  So I will help figure out the most obvious, which is how to charge, right? But also all the other aspects, which is like, how do I think about the messaging of pricing, not not position messaging or not brand messaging or not sales messaging, but like, how do I think about  the messaging around price and how do I solve a specific aspect within price and that was as you pointed out strategy right so those that sell expertise or those that sell strategy it's really hard to sell because it's sometimes hard to verbalize and by doing so it's hard to price and so my job is to close that gap and pricing just happens to me the the mechanism it took guts I'll be honest it's not the word took guts and I was so I've been so afraid for so long but the moment I did it doesn't necessarily change the way in which I work but it changed the way in which I speak to those that don't know me because once you know me you realize oh you can do a couple other things and it's like that it's like that thing just by niching down doesn't magically erase all the other skills that you have and as long as you can have your focus and your breadcrumbs and your connective tissue you can really like get into it with somebody who has a longer standing relationship so I just honestly refocus my attention go deeper into  facing and talk more about it.

11:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's interesting because I also assume that pricing is a recognizable problem for the client, right? And they're like, oh, yeah, this is hurting.  But if you approach that from a more abstract or some other way, they were like, yeah, that's interesting. But I'm not sure I have that problem.  Oh, you do. It's pricing. Sure, yeah.

11:25 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Right.

11:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it's such a nuanced thing, this framing of what we do and connecting with what people are asking. But sometimes people are asking like, I used to do something else, kind of related.  And they were like the academic names for that and the market names for that. And eventually just adopt the market name because people are not checking out to what's the right name to call your thing.  And I remember I always felt a little bit tense when I was talking about that. It appears, because they would use the real name, and I was like, yeah, will they call me on my ?  Am I bullshitting? I don't know. But people are not asking for that thing that is the official name. They're people asking for this thing, right?  So yeah, there's so much around that. But when did you start with this very specific pricing thing?

12:28 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It was probably the talent of 2024. Like I said, I had been doing pricing since 21. I would do these like pricing modeling and pricing sensitivity and talking to people, they would be every single person I have spoken with says, yeah, I have a pricing problem.  It may not be, they may not want to solve it right now. They may be like, I need clients first before pricing becomes an issue.  But this is where I can start to say, hey. like when you're ready or when you really want to go from having good clients to great clients or you finally want to use some version of value raised pricing or you want to go from hourly to such and such is like now you know who to kind of to reach out to and you could do it on your own like I say this to everybody is like sure you can go and do it on your own it's perfectly fine I commend you on your efforts and I just if there's a different lens if my favorite phrase is it's hard to read the label from inside the jar and let me be the one outside the jar and I think sometimes people just like agencies or established founders are like I realize I need that extra little help and that extra help could be $10,000, $15,000, $200,000 worth of value that I just didn't see because I was inside the jar.  Yeah, yeah.

13:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I, well, I think that maybe you're doing this. don't know because I see your contact but LinkedIn doesn't show everything so That that making them making them feel that they've already paying for not doing it right or that Like that the pain point of oh This guy really has been spying on me like how does he know that this is exactly how I feel right?  It's it feels like something that that can you know Make people cross the threshold it's funny. I've mentioned this because one of the things that so from as a workshop guy One of things that I've noticed is that a size of Maybe most yeah, I don't have like numbers on this but maybe most of the recent people that spoke to me They've described their problems or their challenge and what they wanted workshops for around that  the first product where they haven't built enough trust yet and just yesterday I was talking to a guy and he was telling me like there was this tension because it charges a premium and it was like okay I charge a premium I want to keep charging a premium but I understand that some people get they bulk a price right and it was like should I reduce the price should I have like a smaller thing and we were just you know add living because I'm not an expert like yeah maybe it needs to be like cheaper than the other thing but still relatively expensive so it doesn't change like the psychology of it so it's interesting because I think people are I see I see people are at least on my side approaching my thing from the aspect of trust-building and I can see that's relating to your thing for sure so maybe you're seeing the same thing in the market yeah there's two there's

16:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  more than two ways. let's just talk about what you just articulated. That's one of the solutions to the premium pricing problem, right?  The conversion. That's the conversion problem. And one way I talk about this, and you even said it was the reason why you and I probably do strategy and expertise is because it's intangible.  These are the three objections to me. It's intangible. It's long-term impact and compounding impact. And expertise and strategy is really hard to pinpoint.  It's like direct outcome, right? Because it kind of touches everything. But here's what we all know. We know that expertise and strategy is super valuable.  And we know that it is required to run a business long-term. So that's like, that's the problem. That's the problem with the trust, right?  It's like, I know all those things, but those all feel like a risk to me. And so one of the ways that people today is I'll reduce my price, right?  I will make that feel less scary, which is...

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's fine.

17:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  If that's the approach that you want to take, you can go that route. That's fine. I suggest a different route because I think there are different ways of going about it because the more that you underprice, the more that you undersell yourself, then my whole thing that I'm combating is don't underpromise and overdeliver because then you just resent it.  What you are actually saying is, all right, let's combat the aspect of tangibility. I want to attack the tangibility problem or the intangibility problem.  What I would say to this is one of the ways is, okay, you have a $10,000 package. Is there a way in which you can break off $1,000 of that, that value, and show it as your first offer?  Can you break a thousand off, create some, and build the trust, and parlay that trust into the rest of the $9,000?  Roll it in there, just like you could roll it in there. That's one way of building trust is literally pricing through gateway offers or wedge offers or early offers.  That's a pricing mechanic as it relates to service design and offering. This is why I love talking about pricing, because pricing touches literally everything.  So I love that response to it. There are other mechanics, but I'll stop because I'll stop my monologue there.  Is that a monologue?

18:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is that a monologue?

18:12 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I love it. I'll do it. It's a masterclass.

18:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a terrible way I'm starting it. Sorry. I'll tell you why it's a great way. I'll tell you why it's a great way.

18:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Here. Well, let's flip it. It's a great way because what it means is when I see you like look upwards, it means you're actually clocking into your creative brain or strategic brain and trying to draw and connect the dot.  I do the same thing. And so I saw you go like this. I do that. And I also do it as well.  So to me, that's actually a sign of the wheels are spinning and I like it. Yeah.

18:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I warn people. Hey, look, if I start looking outside the frame, it's because I'm thinking. But yeah, you're familiar with the thing.  So right now, just thinking out There's like this web of things. I'm like thinking about so what some of them are like kind of talking shop like yeah Tell me about your world like I'm gonna help you with anything.  I can tell you I'm seeing stuff like this There's the other side which which is the I Don't know I think we have some sort of a kinship of mine I'm like do what books do you like are you do movies?  know this kind of thing and There's the other one which is like the business thing which is like our is there anything here that we could you know help each other In a more structured way just by saying this out loud.  I see kind of a hierarchy, but I'll do We receive this how do I receive all three I say yes.

19:45 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yes, and if I had a third hand, I say let's go Tell me yeah, tell me more and tell me you've gotten me to speak which was Amazing right like you did a good job of doing that continue the thread of those three items  and weave it into the work that you do and the individuals that you solve as well.

20:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I said three things and then I got last. Oppos, shop, personal, okay. So, okay, talking shop, quickly, let's fractalize this thing quickly.  I've been wondering about like people that serve the same sort of markets from a different direction. If what kind of pain points they're seeing, I'll show you or you'll show me whatever you got it.  What kind of pain points you're seeing and like things that seem to be a little bit more nuanced and not everybody can talk about the most, you can.  You can say that. I love like the weird takes and the Peter schizo takes. Personal side, I don't I'm 38, no kids living in Brazil.  I'm from Portugal, I'm not from Brazil. So I spent, I'm married, I spent some time here in Brazil, some time in Portugal, and I keep, you know, alternating.  Love the book, The Business of Expertise, we like it. I keep bringing it up, it's actually next to me because I was just yesterday, I was like, hey, do you read this book to someone?  Yeah, that's it. And opportunities, I don't know yet, but I see that there's a connection between the pricing and the trust and the workshops and there's something there, but we'll figure it out on the West.  See, you did that so succinctly.

21:34 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Just so, just clear, Chris. Well, I have, The Business of Expertise, all of a sudden just keeps coming around in orbit.  I have not read it, but now this is more, you are more, there's more of the people I keep saying that, so now I have to get it.  The other thing, see, now I'm doing the, and looking up out of the frame. Game recognize game, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The, when you say workshop, So I know I kind of tried to say back to you and be a LinkedIn, what that meant.  Help me understand when you say workshops, what you mean, and primarily who it's for, and who is it that you serve.

22:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you for that. the workshops are guided structured meetings, collaborative meetings, where you mix what you know as an expert with what your client knows as their context.  they're a facilitative consulting mode, right? So you work together in a session, and they always have an outcome. So a meeting is not a workshop, but workshops are kind of a meeting.  And it's very easy, and I think this is kind of a kink in the thing I'm trying to address.  It's very easy to have been through a bad workshop. But sometimes you can call it a workshop, and it's just people talking and rent.  going on. So I've been, like, noodling on that. The people that I think could best benefit from this are, like, people that do this sort of, like, strategic work.  And they sell expertise and they need to make that expertise tangible. But there's an element of it I'm realizing more and more.  That is, it's not, there's a sweet spot of process, of rigidity, right? And a checklist is not a workshop.  A workshop can have elements of a checklist, but at some point it just becomes just an interrogatory. So I struggle to explain in better ways, which is, thank you for the opportunity.  But mostly people working together to solve a complex thing that cannot be addressed by one-on-one conversations and it just takes too long to build consensus and to build buy-in and so on.  So I just compress all of those conversations, you like in a session, okay, now we have this thing, we have this structure to address this thing, you have your perspective, my perspective, and the pressure for time and clear outcomes and we get there.  I don't love my answer, but I trust your tolerance.

24:27 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I don't love my answers sometimes either. Yeah. I use the word, here's why I ask. Well, me let you finish in terms of who, like what is and who can vary?  I'm sure who can vary, but maybe if you gave painted a picture of a clear scenario or an ideal scenario or just a scenario that representative.  Okay.

24:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I love this kind of role-playing things. you are consultant or or like either solo, I'm trying to move away from solos but or a small consulting firm and you have these expertise that is weird and common, right?  And that's why it's valuable. And you got into a project with the clients, but there are no simple problems anymore, like every problem is complex now.  So you need a way to work with your clients and work with clients is like the mode of today.  You need to work with the clients and you need a way to do this. And most people have not learned how to do this.  Either they are like good at it, like their people person or something like that. Most people don't know how to guide the conversation and interaction and the dance of it.  And the workshop gives you kind of rails on how to do that. And so if you're like a principal, founder principal, like the first person at the company or so on, I think this is useful.  But as if more useful if you have, like, other people that are not as savvy as you are because the workshop gives them, like, a minimum quality level, like, if you follow this structure, there's some variability, but you've reduced that variability.  Do you feel I answered the question?

26:18 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  You've provided a framework, but now I want to test you a little bit and say, what's, you said, complex business problem.  Give me an example or a complex business problem that you think is, like, perfect for this type of conversation.

26:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's say you are helping, you are an agency or helping someone to, you know, get started on a business idea, right?  And a business idea has, like, all these different moving parts and the ideator usually have their own lens, right?  They think about it from, I don't know, product, right? think about it marketing, I don't know, they think about it from one specific lens, right?  the more you know about, the more you explore this business idea, the more things you discover about the business idea, so it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and at some point it collapses under the entropy of that thought, right?  So as an agency, you are experienced at building digital products, and you mix that with the experience of handling the complexity with a client that is not used to that.  So you have a series of workshops, and each workshop is focused on one thing, and you kind of create eight ways in between decisions.  Thank you. That are not only practical, because I think one of the advantages of workshops that they make sense from a practical perspective, but also from a symbolic perspective.  Like, oh yeah, we had that session, there were four of us, it was a big deal, a decision was made, now it's expensive to turn back on our decision, so let's just keep, you know, moving forward.  So this would be like an ideal situation. Developing a digital product for you. You're kind of new to this thing But you have ideas like I cannot just keep from your hands and develop it myself But then it's like a structural way to take this You just said when you said the word gateway it must have clicked something What happened there?

28:19 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Was it the word gateway that you said?

28:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, thank you Yeah, yeah, because you've used the word gateway before as gateway offers as an offer. Yeah. Yeah, and then I was I Was thinking like yeah, I think it's a good analogy for The mental model I have of my clients agency owners is that they struggle with different things and one of the things is like this Long time to make decisions on the part of clients and clients Asking for too many revisions and walking back on their decisions and stuff like that So gateway felt like oh, there's a threshold we crossed that and now we are at a different level of Development so when you've went to that gateway words  I was like, okay, yeah, this feels like a good word.

29:04 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, the word complex problem, to me, I understand what you're saying, but I wanted some tangibility to it, just like that desire for, we're past the 27 minutes.  Are you okay? I am, are you okay? I am okay, yep, I made a buffer because just when I saw the 27 minutes, I thought that was the most amazing setup for the record because it gets you to ask this question in the three minutes, as opposed to being late, as do you have additional moments, right, of time?  So I'll go back, I thought, which is the concept of complex business is understandable, but it's not biteable, and I think there's a tangibility that lacks to it, that is missing to it.  And when you started to say, the word, as you started talking about gateway and started talking about deconstructing the problem and facilitating a workshop, I started to think about instead of complex.  I'm like, not like multi-variable products, like sequential products, sequential problems that it's like, you in order for you to do this is like, you need to break them down into portable elements.  And in order for that to happen is your expertise needs to kind of be deconstructed. And in order for that to happen, you need someone who's reading the label from outside the jar, right?  And I may not be, I'm saying I, the royal I right now, I guess, is like, I may not be the expert as to what you do, but what I can do is I can help be the bumpers on a bowling alley to help shape your thought so that you can deconstruct and you can be able to articulate this to somebody else.  Am I understanding you right when you say the word complex and I just broke it down that way?

30:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  am I off? Yes, yes.

30:44 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  No, you are right.

30:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it's a really good, it's a them thing, right? People see that it's a much better way. Thank you.

30:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I struggle with the word strategy. I always have like strategy has so many different definite, so does value. I have so many different definitions, and they're these vague things that I have just been trying really, really, really hard to be not just specific, but like tangible.  I've been calling things like phrases with feeling. If you can find the phrase that carries the feeling, it's hard to read the label from inside the jar is a phrase with feeling.  You get it, and it packs a punch. It just does. The word complex problems, or even in the strategy, those are like you get, but they don't just...  It's like you know it, but it's just not there. I apologize if this is coming across as a critique, but I know that I struggle with this too in the term of strategy.  I try to find a way in which to do that. I'm still working on it, but I found that as I'm starting to break these off, gateway, bumpers, these phrases have been helpful to me and thought I would share.

31:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, thank you. Thank you. This is really appreciated. And the funny thing is both of those things... relate to something you can touch, Gateways, bumpers, oh, like I can touch them, right?  So I think in terms of analogies, that seems to be like a common thing, like relate to what people can touch.  And nerds like us, we love the flexibility of abstraction, but most people are not like that, right? So it's so funny, like now hearing you unpack like this complex business and how it doesn't mean anything really, it didn't use these words, but like, yes, I get it.  So like, yeah, I mean, in which way is it complex? Oh, it's complex because of this thing. Oh, okay, so let's talk about this thing, because the complex is as an aggregating label that you put on a lot of different things, and but maybe the person doesn't see, right?  So that was really interesting. So in terms of strategy, I can't imagine because there's so many people using the word in like the worst possible ways and...  At some point, I was really interested in strategy because I felt that I had missed my career. So I studied design.  went to school for design. And when I was in school, I like design and so on, but I was always more drawn to the systemic view or the function, like I studied industrial design.  And what I cared about was not 3D modeling was like, oh, how does this fit? like, what features does this thing allow?  then at some point, was like, oh man, maybe I should have, I would have liked the career in strategy, but I was already 34 and I was like, yeah, I'm not going to shift now.  I know no big credentials or anything. And I went reading on that, right? So for instance, here in Brazil, advertising is the career you choose if you're a smart creative person.  It's very strong. So in Brazil, the word strategy is really related to the planning world of advertisement, right? And I would like, I could do the course on that and I was like, yeah, I get it, but I don't think this is like the strategy.  And then I went reading on grand strategy, great books. Really interesting was like, yeah, but I'm not at this level.  I'm not at the think tank, like in about the future of the Belt and Road Initiative. That's not me.  And then I started to dial it back to like where I'm already at, which is like, I'm already at the workshop thing.  But I understand what you mean, because strategy is a difficult thing to, and I think the phrases with feeling is probably the answer for the strategy, to find some frequency to help people tune into a frequency that they've never noticed that was always around them, right?

34:58 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Frequency, that's a good word. word yeah yeah like because I think that's that's kind of the core of a good insight it was always there and you're like oh yeah this guy's so it takes no convincing like it's self convincing but how do you approach that from us because I have the time I'm just you know enjoying the conversation I would I used to posture meaning like try to basically I would try to pretend that I'm smart versus just being smart like that was kind of the approach is I wanted I tried to like articulate all these and I think actually a lot of people do this as well until I've started to really hone in on this idea like phrases with feeling frequency that we we we how many is we this time which is like we're afraid to get specific because it doesn't apply to everyone but in reality when you present something with specificity it allows someone to actually draw a  Action to something that relates to them, right? And that's something that I think has been strategy is this big thing It really is we kind of know what it is, but it's not specific But when I start to talk about something that is specific as it relates to strategy then somebody can connect the dots to their own situation and It's this level of tangibility Specificity that I'm no longer afraid to go go into because I've learned I've realized that when somebody says something specific to me That is not at all related to what I'm talking about like I just all of a sudden turn it around and say oh That's exactly how I related to my world and that's and so this is You're saying is like what's the problem?  Like can you describe the problem so that it's like they are Inside their head I can do that and it can relate to a whole bunch of not I'm saying But just like we can do that so it's specificity and and I like to say strategy, but at the answer  is all in this lack of fear or removal of fear to get very specific on something to understand that in order to get into a house, you walk through a door, right?  That's very specific, right? The whole house may be the strategy, but or the whole house may be the problem, but you walk through the door, get specific.  And it's I've always struggled with the word niche, but it's like in reality, niche is just it's a door and you can do more than that.  But just like, can you get somebody to the door? Can you get somebody to be able to speak your language?  Can they be on the same frequency or within the same frequency? So let's relate it to the thing that you also said, right?  This big problem, break off the piece, make it a gateway offer, make it an initial like an initial hurdle to build that trust.  That's the point of that is to get to the doors to get to that that aspect of being able to speak the same language.  It's taken years and I'm so far away from being successful or clearly ending this, but at least I feel like there are breadcrumbs to this larger, this larger answer.

38:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I totally feel you. Like, so, two things. First thing, I suspect that a lot of your clients are really clever, probably on the, either on the spectrum or gifted or like, not average.  I think it's probably self-selecting, I don't know. Oh, that's interesting.

38:29 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It's an interesting question.

38:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I, so the other day, I've noticed also like, I don't ask about this, but he comes up in conversation and people eventually mention like some aspect of neurodivergence.  And I've realized, okay, so the people that seem the most enthusiastic, they seem to have these things, and neurodivergence is by definition, not a thing, it's many things, right?  different openness to look at things in a different way. But this openness is also comes with some quirks, for instance, of systems.  People love systems and they're like a play with systems and it feels like work but it's not work. You're playing with Lego and stuff like that.  And I fall for this over and over again. Sometimes like, am I working or am I playing with Lego?  Yeah, I am playing with Lego. Okay, let's get to work. So I've noticed that there's a pattern and some of the things that I've started to investigate and so far away from getting there, it's like, okay, so maybe there are things about how to work with these outlier people, right?  Because I can see pricing being kind of, what's the name of the thing you put on top of your house so a lightning bolt doesn't.  A lightning rod? Lightning rod. So maybe that's the lightning rod for their attention, like yeah, pricing. But there's like so many other things around the way they see themselves.  So like an oddly specific problem I've been noticing. is people that love the work and they give away too much for free because they're just so happy to see that the other one recognizes them as knowledgeable because they're used to being weird like their families get them but not really you know and it's like and I feel this way oftentimes so this is like I am these guys and this is very like specific thing so I've started to make like a list of pain points for some of my clients best clients and yeah it comes up a lot like yeah what's your thoughts on this that is a fascinating distillation of a problem that you do not realize is a problem but that's right it is true that I'm gonna second that statement which is those that find their work as play will tend to give it away yeah

41:03 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm glad we're recording.

41:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to want them for the record.

41:05 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  did not bring in my fathom, I'm going to. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You might get me through.

41:09 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  That was, that is a really interesting insight. You also had another insight earlier on that we did not acknowledge that I want to acknowledge here because you're on to something, which is I'm seeing a trend of people moving away from working just with solos.

41:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am.

41:29 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Like I am seeing that and I don't think people realize that even myself has kind of done that as well, where you moved more, you're moving to more of a not sophisticated buyer, but more seasoned or established or maybe experienced, maybe who's who like just realized that you said game recognized game, right?  That was a good way of saying it, which is I think that that's happening. So I want to just, those two together are two important threads that you should, as some people say, double.  click into because I think that's interesting. I'm going to have to think about that more and find the connective tissue to other aspects because I wouldn't call that a pain, right?  You what mean? Like you used the word pain about giving away too much for free and in reality, I guess it is a pain.  It's an unforced error.

42:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe it's an unforced error, right?

42:28 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  And I think it's okay to give things away for free, but if you do it too much, it's unsustainable.  Yeah, yeah.

42:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it makes it yeah, I mean, this conversation could go on forever. mean, we'll need to schedule another one.  I have a longer link. Yeah, okay, let's not open another thread.

42:48 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  This is another loop.

42:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm looking outside the frame. think you're looking outside the frame. I think we have some some things buzzing.

42:57 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Let's just look like this from now on. Just pretend it's over there.

43:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I'm so glad we got to talk, it was a very densely packed, cool conversation. Alright, so let's do this.

43:12 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  The typical question at the end is how can I help you? And my response to this is when I find the right people that I speak with, I say this.  Say two points makes a line, three points makes a trend. And that's a mathematical, that's a math phrase, but I say immediately we schedule a next call, another conversation.  Because I think this, while being introductory and knowledge sharing, the second one ends up being a little bit deeper.  And then by the third conversation, you actually figure out a way to work together, or just a way in the future, it has a mental bookmark.  So I like to say the way in you can help me, and the way that I think I can help you, is by having another conversation.  think that that's the tangible touch point. Let's do it.

43:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does that make sense?

43:56 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It makes a lot of sense, yes.

43:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Well, where are you in East Coast, Connecticut?

44:05 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  am just two hours outside of, two and a half hours outside of New York City. So what time is it there?  It's 12, 13 p.m. 12, 13.

44:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK. So. I was next week for you. Actually, what?

44:25 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, what time is it for you? I'm curious what time zone right now?

44:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's, it's two o'clock in the afternoon. OK, so you're two hours ahead of me?

44:34 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yes. Thursday, the 13th, Thursday, Friday is OK, too. We can keep the same schedule if it works for you.

44:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it? Let's see what times are right now.

44:51 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It's it was 11. Next Friday, maybe not. Let's do let's do next Thursday. OK, new. Can you do your, your three o'clock, um, maybe, maybe, maybe actually, let's do a, um, how about this?  How about you send me your calendar link and I will, I'll make it work. Yeah. I don't want to squeeze it in and I want to make sure that there's ample time.  There's ample time.

45:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My, my, my, my, my other link is usually 45, 47 minutes, but I like 47 minutes. That's cool. Yeah.

45:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)

45:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. That's cool. Just weird, weird numbers. Uh, I'll send you, I'll send it to you right now and I'll send it also on LinkedIn.  So you get the, thank you. So you get the thing. Okay. There you go. And LinkedIn. Super secret link.  Yeah. Yeah.

45:52 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Don't, don't share it with anyone.

45:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I hit it's funny.

45:55 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I call it mine the secret menu. And now with Australia mode, interesting. Down under, very clever.

46:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, people from Australia, couldn't get them. So I needed to change the windows.

46:13 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Well, the fact that you put it upside down is really a clever move there. Thank you.

46:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like to be cheeky.

46:21 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Have a great weekend.

46:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You too. Just you too.

46:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Be well.

46:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is great. Thank you.
