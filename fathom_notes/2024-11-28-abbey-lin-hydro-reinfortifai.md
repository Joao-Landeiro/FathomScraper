  I had to write to her, she has not responded, and I'll just write to her. I just saw that you had accepted a bit of this meeting.  Let's see what's the calendar. Let's see, is not really, it's like back to back tomorrow. I really don't have any time tomorrow at home.  I could try to find another time. Same here, tomorrow is totally looked at.

0:55 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Okay, I'm just going to send it to her.

1:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I think we can still talk, at least there's a lot to cover. That was an interesting meeting with Mari, who is a typical subject matter expert, Zhao and Mao, and Linda is also a subject matter expert, if she joins this call.  So they have strong opinions on how things should be done according to that. And I think it was a good reminder that there are some, like, probably issues with the third-party process that we had thought through, that I think I will sit down with her and try to map out her process to make sure we might need to redraw it based off of that.  And same with risk assessment, another IDD process I understand where she's coming from on that, I was thinking about a control.  But that's one of the challenges also. think that I don't know if we'll be able to make a tool that, like, fits 100% for somebody who already has an existing process, you know, but then if we can convince them to, like, try one parts of it that they don't have, like, the controls part of that, then it might be good.  But otherwise, I don't know, Rui, do you have any thoughts based on that last call?

2:05 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  I think, obviously, it's very good to have access to someone who has so much input to give and is able to articulate it, but I think what I would keep in mind is, as a product, where is the baseline, right, for the Toyota drivers, does that increase the threshold of getting into the tool for people like Zeneta.  So I think you need to keep having checks and balances view on that, because you might be satisfying a very advanced user while not pleasing on meeting the needs of the biggest scale of users that you might get in the beginning.  it's a difficult, unfortunately, it's thanks game.

3:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Thanksgiving now so I couldn't get the Zanetta on like Thursday or Friday because one of them's based in the US so that's why I couldn't find a time so we probably have to have a meeting with them without really an opinion there but they're really nice both of them are American and they'll have a different opinion like when we talk to them they don't have a strong opinion usually on everything they're like oh that's good okay that's great and so that'll be also interesting with Aberdeen which is the UK company tomorrow I don't know if you guys can join that but that's a to get some feedback but he does have some subject matter expertise because he came as an accountant before so he can understand this in some sense.  I have it on account.

3:40 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Okay great I know yeah. What I would what I would take advantage of because your development is going quite fast is very soon I mean it's up to you João and the rest of the team to decide but I think it's quite desirable to  will use the developed version to let them click around and have them understand because that's a very different type of user input than what we've been doing.  We've been clicking around and showing things quite fast, but then to verify usability and command of the pool, how comfortable they are with it, it would be very good if you only have 10% of the things developed, that's fine, but at least you get some input on those.  And I think since you're going very fast, and that's really cool, you should use that to your advantage. So move away from prototypes to the actual thing.

4:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I realized like we're going to be prototyping really, it got so loud in my mouth that like by the end of December, we'll have risk assessment, third party, pretty much all of it done except for reporting and board, you know, the ones that you guys are building.  And so in the process, I have a feeling like it's not going to be like when you actually click through the fall, even like when like Pinar was  going through it today. was like, oh yeah, we forgot that. Oh, we didn't have it built that out yet.  Oh, we haven't built that part out yet. And so I think that's going to come out of the process and the flows, is that the development is to build what Pinar you guys have made already, but then when you actually try to click through it and try to do that, it doesn't totally make sense.  And we almost have to find the gap, make some designs and then do it. yeah.

5:26 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  And I think you should do that based on the observations of seeing people using it, talking aloud, see what they think, see where they freeze and wonder what is this.  I think that can be very informative to focus your efforts.

5:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, can you hear me?

5:49 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah, hi everybody.

5:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think one layer is what Rudy is saying in terms of, and how the user will navigate throughout everything.  But I'm also taking another layer that we are discussing with Epic, which is the whole experience in terms of being very fluid, and it should be very friendly, perhaps fun at some point.  And what I saw in the next meeting is a very, very savvy user, would say, as you started, well, they are very into the process.  They quickly understood everything about the platform, this is developed until now. So they seemed very comfortable with everything, of course, as a huge thing to be of, you know, it's all the...  ESG parts of the platform. what I'm trying to say is like, and the next meeting we can also get more in depth about usability and also the interest itself.

7:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It should be fun.

7:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It shouldn't be fun or, I don't know, I think we can gather some kind of inputs about, you know, the whole visuals and students as well.

7:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I think like, yeah, I was finding that balance of fun, because I think users like Mari or Linda, like who are subject matter experts, they're not necessarily like looking for fun, they just want something to get it done and like there.

7:39 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But I think like to like engage somebody like maybe like Abby and like like from Zeneta or like they're not as interested, they're interested but not so interested and make it very easy for them to do.  Like I get like fun, it doesn't have to be like kind of corny joke kind of thing, but like at visually appealing to something who doesn't want to do this job.

8:00 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  job and has been assigned this job, but then doesn't have the subjective matter expert or interest in like doing it the right way or doing it all the way.

8:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  That's kind of the, and especially on the employee side, kind of chatted like texted about that now, it's like employees are the worst, right?

8:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They who loves to fill in an expense thing or like do that, you know, like, so it's more important that they have it fun than necessarily like the admin person.  But I think that will make our tool stand out like, even think about that and kind of have that in the back of our head, the way that the design that you guys have done it, you know, like it's already much nicer than a lot of the other tools, right, that are out there.  So I think if we continue to be a little bit different, and that I think it'll be good.

8:41 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  yeah, yeah, don't lose, don't lose that voice that you know, that tone, any kind of shaping, think it's good to keep developing that and understand how, you know, try to lower all the time to lower  threshold of getting into the tool, daring to click around and not being afraid to break anything. That's kind of where the sweet spot would be, I think, for the type of users.

9:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Add into that what Ed just said. I'm also thinking about, you know, the sales approach. As long as we have a very  platform that is going to do all the job, but for a sales perspective, I think looking good and looking fun is a very good selling argument.  Yeah, exactly.

9:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, so I think the integrity hub and kind of these flows, it's been nice that I've been able to show something because people do get it immediately, like once we have something, know, like before we started this, gosh, it was only three months ago, like it was everything was in my head, right?  And we had to put post-its and like, you know, that and now like the compliance map, especially on. So show that more than like the dashboard because the compliance map is what everyone's like sweet You know like they they're like, oh, she do have everything like okay I get it now and then when you go in they see that so the compliance map is actually I'm gonna pay that people will go to more than just like the dashboards especially for the ones who just want to get it done So I think we're we're onto something so I like so now that I want to think I want you to think of the back You're ahead like you know Either as an extension of this product or another part is it's like our whole branding and our whole website and how do it make everything?  Kind of match with the look and the feel of this tool right like it's like how do we like change our branding?  Do we need to change our logo to look lumina or something like that? You know like I'm like happy to do something to change it But like I'll probably leave that for you and your expertise, but I do think we'll try to change our branding and our logo and our look to match the design a little bit more so Yeah, that would be an avenue to pursue that I would recommend in terms of Shaping the brand to fit the product

11:00 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  that better. So I guess we are just using this time.

11:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  we don't we can get out.

11:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yes, we'll talk about like it more like any like we really and Pinara are like leaving soon after like the end of this month.  So it's like, or I don't know, maybe around, I'm guessing, but like, is there any, any other questions or Xiao or Mao, or otherwise we can just get off and save you guys 15 minutes or something else.  But is there, do you have what you need or, well, we have everyone here. I know Maurice reached out to me earlier, but I was sick and then I got took some time to get back.

11:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I don't know if there's still any lingering.

11:37 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  I hope it was a better.

11:40 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah. That's good.

11:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We are we have everything we need right now.

11:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think was what we showed two days ago was was good for our reflection. So we are working on top of that.  I think we are fine.

11:57 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  We intend to do

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If help Abby and need to do something, are going to reach out. Okay.

12:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Linda misunderstood.

12:09 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  She had accepted, we can find a time next week then.

12:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  She's only available before lunch, but I'll write to her and try to find another time with her. But okay, then we'll just leave off that and we can be in touch.  We still need tomorrow. exactly.
