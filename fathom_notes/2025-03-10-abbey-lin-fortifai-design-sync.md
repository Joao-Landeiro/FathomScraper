0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How was your weekend yeah it was good we went to the sauna and I how about you I did a lot of fixing things around the house and I met some friends for coffee what's a perfect weekend for you even well I had a nice one and the perfect one is just relaxing but yeah whether it nice I went to the countryside here and drank wine and ate some food and that's it so it was winning

1:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I cannot complain, to be honest. Nice.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello, Abby. Oh, no.

1:10 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Hello, hello.

1:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK. So let me share my screen. Do, do, do, do. Window, profile, share. OK. Using my screen, infinite mirror.  Yes, nice. OK. OK. So, Romeo, I'm going to present here something that you can tell OK.

1:36 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I think I was wrong about that test that is in review, that is in progress at this OK. Do you want to start with something?

1:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. Anything specific?

1:47 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, I'm working on it but I don't have anything to present. OK.

1:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Anything that is blocking you? Anything that you need more information on? No.

1:57 - Romeu Rodrigues
  OK. And then there is nothing to show now.

2:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this was a mistake that that task was not actually in review, still in progress. So we don't have much to show today on Monday, but we can perhaps use this time to discuss other things.  This is question from the design side to the development side. Anything from us that you guys need that is blocking you?

2:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, not right now to be honest, so we finished with controls on the east side, we tested it and we are ready for release if you are okay with that.  We can release it to production. So for all of you or like including like the carbon or just no, no, no, Sorry, G G G production so that our users can see that's ready.

2:57 - A L
  Seems okay, right.

2:59 - Ivan Ćelić
  And I think also tested it. mostly there is an email missing which we didn't have but we didn't plan it so that's like a small thing that we can discuss if we need and that's it.  So really if you can just quickly scan through it if nothing pops up out then we are ready to release you.  Okay. Okay Doki.

3:20 - A L
  Can I have a look at it? Yeah.

3:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah let me know, let me know when you take a look if that's it there's also a question that Abby sent I think on Friday regarding the integrity hub he said I realize I've missed the integrity hub that should be developed before risk assessments.  Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

3:48 - A L
  So once we have all the controls and then the policies and procedures and then we kind of have the things that we can brag about externally like you know we are doing all the X amount of controls we're doing all of this  And I think especially with the regulations coming in, there were the non-regulations that are coming in, it's not like we need to do this because we need to beat some kind of regulatory pressure that's no longer there.  But we need to do this because we can brag about everything that we do and can use it for customer tenders and we can use it for that.  So it becomes more of an important feature in our tool, rather than saying you have to do this for CSRD compliance.  And now that we actually have the control section, there's something to talk about within the integrity hub that wasn't there before because we didn't know what the controls are going to look like.  Because the controls are the actual work that you're doing. So you can talk about, like, you know, we have a set register, we are looking at carbon reporting one, carbon reporting two, carbon three.  have a conflict of interest register. Like so everything that we have in controls, along with the policies and procedures, we should kind of outline it and kind of put it on like a show off wall, which is integrity hub, is like look at all of these things that we're doing around ESG.  It could just be a list like it is right now in Vanta. So it doesn't have to have any data around it, because they might not want to show the data, but it's actually talking about  about the controls that they're doing. And then eventually after we have the risk assessment, we have other processes, we can put that in, but it's in between then, yeah.  Now we have more content for it. think before we did the control section, we weren't sure how it was gonna land, but now we have it so there's some content that we can actually put in text that we can put in it.

5:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That logic makes a lot of sense to me. So if the regulation is changing, what's left is the breaking rights for now.  Would that push the risk assessment towards later in the calendar? I don't think it will take too long for the integrity hub.

5:45 - A L
  And the question is, is even Ivan's team that does the integrity hub, where's it like we get a web developer as part of the, because it's an external link is what it is.  Like at least you see on other, companies like TrustUpVanta.Portify or something like that so it's kind of an external thing but it is kind of linked because you can also build it within the tool like I would advise to keep it in the same technology and same team but we can we can discuss maybe once we see a bit more because of the layout the design everything will be the same so I would suggest we have we have it built like we do everything else of course external page everything the same but but as part of our app yeah yeah I see I see things the same way so this is the redesign that has been going on on the integrity hub right we put that on ice to deal with the latest things yeah but there there's a design for the integrity hub that is a bit more it's leaner right it used to be more complex yeah I think I I feel like it has like almost like it shouldn't be just text and maybe we can look at I think the other one had too many pictures that we didn't have anything  to go towards it. But then now we have a little bit more control. So you can look at where like TrustSuppanta.com has it, and how they have it, where they have some text.  then they like, yeah, you can look at the Vanta and Tech of Your Hub, and how they do it, and Sprinto.  So then like, so yeah, so one is having a nice intro on top, like the selling point, know, like a welcome, know, fortify is the leading crest, but like this is like people have it right there, know, ask a question, request information, that should also be there.  Vanta. And then you have, you know, on top, have a little thing that says like overview FAQ, because the Integrity Hub is also a place where external people, you know, maybe the suppliers can log in at Integrity Hub, or like the different places there.  and then Sprinto, the link was also in that Figma file, it was in that, I mean, in that that's Figma.  file the the task right there yeah fortified center right there yeah that's our yeah so what even I think was bringing up something is this public to this page I'll be right these are these are websites so we take this and link it to our website to show off what we're doing so this is a public page that sits on sprinto but it's only for fortify so you can see then you can see all the controls ideally we have you know environmental controls or and then we list out what we're doing environmental you know or or you could just put controls and just put them all together um there but like I guess the the main point is that they have like one one header that talks about like you know they care about this and maybe kind of linking it with the company like both Sprinto and Vanta have on on top you know I think Vanta is a  cooler, know, and then there's like ask question request access, you know, and then and then there's like some you don't need all of this.  I think it's too much and they have a lot more controls, you know, on what they're doing. But I think if we have it on like just our controls, maybe our policies, controls, you know, I don't know, hub, we could be a login to the supplier hub that way.  But it's, these are just like to kind of talk about what we're doing, you know, yeah.

9:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So conceptually, I think this, I understand all of this, but this, the decision of pushing this ahead of risk assessment, have clients asked for this right now?

9:51 - A L
  No, because it doesn't really exist in the market. So this is like kind of a differentiator for us. And I also think this is a  good selling point for us because once we get Cognite to put this on their website where they're bragging that more people are going to know about Fortify.  That's kind of how Vanta and them spread out their company because they they did this. So I think in terms of like kind of business wise and getting us out there and like having companies talk and brag about us I think it's important and I think I didn't push it earlier because there was nothing to kind of brag about but once they have actually the controls and they have the third pay in along with the policies procedures trainings then there is actually something to brag about risk assessment yes they brag about it when they do it but it's not as important as the other controls that are there.

10:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No I understand but I think my point is this is a big road map decision in my opinion because everything is possible but everything has more ramifications than it seems at first glance right.  So what I'm thinking is this is a core aspect of Vanta and Sprint job right they probably have a theme of like at least seven people working on this maybe five.  So, if we're trying to do this as a customer acquisition move, it makes sense to put energy into it, and it makes sense to really dedicate some energy for that.  And my thinking right now is if customers don't have a model for this, they don't know they need this, but they know they need other things, I would focus our limited attention on the things that they are already talking about, it seems to me that risk assessment could be more within their own perception of what's missing, but maybe I'm wrong.

11:38 - A L
  Yeah, I don't think this is a lot of work, because I think that this is an external website, especially if we want to do the light version, not actually integrated to our systems on that.  I think it's a quick win that they can have and to say what they're doing. So, I don't think it's necessarily a lot of investments, but I think it's more like a webpage of design that can be used.  put up in there I think that so in terms of I think this has always been on our list I think it's more we didn't have controls to know what we're going to write about it I think in terms of risk assessment I think risk assessment needs to be I so I guess my point is like I think this should be it shouldn't take more than a day or two and even correct me I'm just like putting up a one page yeah like a link yes so what's what's necessary so maybe maybe around the week about the week I don't see everything yet but we need to aggregate all the statuses for each organization so on the back and said we need to create these entry points we have them but we just need to list them we need to create a public page from the designers it won't be hard to do especially from what I've seen it's nothing special but it will take at least a day to implement all these different layouts that we have so it will take in the end you will it will take at least three to five days

13:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  We completed with the release, testing, bugs, everything. So it will delay us for about a week, plus, minus, of course.  That's like. Like in terms of, I guess, like, because it doesn't necessarily need to be integrated.

13:12 - A L
  It's like, for me, it's like in the beginning, if we think about the easiest thing, it's more like we know that they're working with certain control, like then, like, it's more they deploy it than it turns green or something or it does not be linked at this point.  Because like Sprinto, for Sprinto, it's like we went in and then we just pick the ones that we wanted to be shown.  It wasn't actually linked to our system, whereas I think Vantage is probably more complex, and it's actually linked in real time to the system.  So they turn red and green. Where Sprinto is like you just collect, just pick the ones that you want to, like, brag about, and then you select it and it goes to the site.  Or we can, like, just be like, OK, for her pilots, we don't even have that selection process. We just create a web page that we, you know, let them, you know, and then we manually do it for the pilot, just so that it starts.  but I wouldn't say that's that complex, to do still, and I wouldn't

14:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe cut the corner because I'd say we can do it. It's just like a week is not a lot But this to us right now.  That's the thing, you know, we would cut the corner We would save like a day or two more maybe and we'll have us some kind of hot product While we do this properly I really want to see the quality design then I can give you better better estimate that then I can say really It is a week or it's less or more or something So but but I would I would suggest we do this proper at least from the back-end side because it's it wouldn't be that hard Maybe but still I need to see what needs to be shown because if we need to show that someone has a control set up and active That's that shouldn't be a problem.  We just need to aggregate all the data That will be the only thing we need to do we need to aggregate all the stuff for each organization and Show them on the trust page Yeah, so I think that So for I think I think we should prioritize this Because this is kind of a competitive advantage for our company.

14:59 - A L
  I don't think people are asking about it but I don't think they're gonna like say I don't want it either but um but I think to have an updated drawing and then for Yvonne to say okay is this gonna take one week or two weeks yeah how do we do that could be good but I guess the question is like does Romeo have enough information now to just drive or do I need to have a meeting with Xiao to discuss what should be in it or it to be drawn or can we kind of copy a version that like we I think we even have a UX UI designer like the previous UX UI designer she just copied a version of like of like the trust center from Vanta or something and see she made it like we could just you know use that version or just like I don't know for Romeo so what you have enough information this version I have in front of us is the second version of our integrity right yeah because the first one had a lot of things and then then we decided to remove things which is we

16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's fine. So the question is, is this version we are seeing now not good enough or not? This is not a good phrasing, but I mean, should we change the second version?  Should we should we move into the third version? Yes, okay. What should we change? What specifically should we change?

16:18 - A L
  Well, like I said, like there's like that pop header part that is there in the other ones. I do think we need to update this to match the new controls that we have in our system that are going to be like, you know, carbon reporting one or carbon reporting two cloud like the text should match.  If we can have like either an FAQ or like a submit request button kind of like the Vanta, I think if actually just make it look like Vanta, like a nice version of Vanta without like the certifications and then without so many controls, like you have to send the request, you have the different things and like, then it's good enough.

17:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  just making a list. What is AFK? is that? Request for information? RFK? What happens when I request information?

17:31 - A L
  I think it would go to a contact point, probably be like it would send an email or like to or it goes into like you know it's like a whistleblowing thing it goes into the controls and then you get like a feedback from somebody like whoever's probably the manager like so whoever's a contact point for the admin portal would get an email.  Got it so but anyone can can ask for this right?

17:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

17:58 - A L
  Okay so

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not part of, if I'm not an employee, if I'm not a third party, and I request this information, would I have to sign in for an external person portal to see, to track this?

18:13 - A L
  I don't know, I'm curious, we should check how it's done in Vanta, like they have an ability to secret information.  From what I've seen, I think when I click on it, it's like it's a submit button, you're just like, yeah, go request information on top, all the way on top, there on the purple right there.  This is access, not information, so okay, request access, yeah, and it goes here, and then, actually, I wonder if you go to Sprinto, because if you go to our official one in Sprinto, does it have a request access on it?  it might not because 39 policies, sort of conduct, because there's no way to access it. If it can come to us, then we can say, we can see where it comes on that side.  So like, Sprintos is like, maybe Sprintos is like the initial version. We don't have request access on it. And then we just do it like this.  I don't know.

19:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK.

19:33 - A L
  Oh, request access, request access for the policies. OK, so sure.

19:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, we can put a button, it's just starting to branch out, right?

19:49 - A L
  If we request access, we need to manage this user that has access to some things.

19:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For now, that would be good.

19:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  If you could have a first version without it, that would be good. This is crucial for the integrity of requesting access.

20:04 - A L
  No, I don't think so. don't think we can have the supplier hub link in there. I don't think requesting access is key.  I think if we want to have a Sprintel version and then have the email, you want more information, go to info at like, I think it's one of the.  For now, that will be the best for this order.

20:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Later, we can have these things like they have you requesting.

20:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if we took our list of controls and put it in the design, a little bit like this, as opposed to this, would that be good?  Yeah, and then like you could put the policies.

20:46 - A L
  know, we have all the list of the policies now that we have for ease. So you can put that in there and then trainings.  You could also put all the list of all the trainings that we have that are there. communication I don't think you have to have but it could be interesting on the we want to add that or not for bragging but I think the other ones are more important.

21:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so Ivan in order for you to feel more comfortable making some sort of estimation design is important I assume.

21:23 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah I did get the feeling for the back and stuff already I think it won't change design but I just want to see how how much stuff on the front that we need to add.  You'll see it we'll know if we miss something because that's usually how we all work when we see it we'll be we'll know for sure but but yeah.

21:41 - A L
  And it could be good that this is just the outward page right like and this is the the question of like for initial ones do we want to set it up just like how would we set it up from internal website and I can log we can log into Sprinto and show you and then there may be another call where you kind of just go in and be like you just go select which ones do you want I wonder if I can even get into Sprinto I don't know.  Brighton's here. that's another layer of things, right?

22:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Brighton, are you able to get into Sprinto as an admin?

22:09 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Can we?

22:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is it really important to select which ones you want to brag, or can we just have a simple select all or none?  Or maybe basically have the website available or don't have it available for the first word? No, ideally they can select it.

22:23 - A L
  I don't think everyone's going to do every control. you know, so you can kind of just like, here's a list of other controls, select the ones you want to do.

22:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can maybe show only the ones that they completed. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

22:33 - A L
  Yeah, only show the ones that they completed.

22:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  think that people don't want to be called but I'm not completing it. Yeah, exactly.

22:38 - A L
  I do think we're going to have to change our entrance page on policies, procedures, training and controls that you go into first one page.  Step one is like select the controls you want to execute and then step two is like the deployment within it.

22:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  I do think we're going to have to redesign that based off of the feedback and everything.

22:55 - A L
  But that could be a point, you know, when they go select the ones you're going to do, then that also triggers it.  the other ones that aren't there. But in the meantime, I think... Brighton, are you able to log in to Sprintone and speed the trust center?  Brighton, are you there? Yes, excuse me.

23:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, let me try sharing. Can you see Sprintone?

23:19 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Yes, it's coming.

23:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Okay, so trust center here.

23:22 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Yeah.

23:24 - A L
  Oh, are you not an admin?

23:26 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  I thought you're an admin on the trust center.

23:28 - A L
  Let me try. agree.

23:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think we try to also log in.

23:34 - A L
  Preview mode. it's a preview mode. is only...

23:37 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Oh, N. We don't have N.

23:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  . I thought we took N.

23:41 - A L
  Yeah, we are admin, but...

23:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yvonne, are you admin then?

23:46 - A L
  But I see the same as Brighton. I thought we took... We did. I mean, we are... we took N out.

23:56 - Brighton (Fortifai)
  Oh, N is still inside until we delete his microsoft. Yeah, but I thought we had...

24:00 - A L
  He can him off as admin like who's admin then is that me then why is he listed there? They're all admin so me you Brighton most of all we are for for admins here I see okay then why does it say we have to only visit you do not have access and then it opens mail what what is the total request access anyway because I have ends email so just send a request access form and I can see if it comes by but otherwise um then you should reach out Brighton reach out to Arjun at Sprinto and have him give you access yeah request access I have it doesn't seem to be going through either because it doesn't seem to want to go through because I have an email forward to me so it should come in but it's not so I mean it opens my email client which is a bit late your message you you'll see I'll okay okay then Brighton can you write to Arjun  and asking him to give you access to it. from what I remember, think, I remember N showing me, like you just go to a page and select what you want to view, and then you just select it.  So it was like, it wasn't like a super high tech, like you could have lied and said, like, we've done a lot more than we actually did.  It wasn't like super high tech for at least Super Sprinto. I think Santa is a little bit more on top of that.  I'll be, I'll send you any moment, maybe you can give me access to some.

25:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, let me see. Oh yeah, I see it.

25:32 - A L
  Did it work? I just clicked on that link, but nothing happened. I'm requesting access. It's really.

25:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, it doesn't.

25:42 - A L
  I think you to do it in the tool, but it just goes to the link there. So I think there's just something.  Something's being on their side.

25:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

25:54 - A L
  Yeah. But we can, we'll check with our contact point and try to figure out. Yeah. Yeah, we can check that we will come back and next one.  We'll we'll we'll check with our contact at Sprint to find take try to take n out so you guys can show you this.  Hello.

26:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. But regardless of that, I think we're discussing the v1 of the integrity hub and generally speaking, the least customization, the faster we can put these out, right?  So on a very basic level, this is a list, this is page with a list of things that they have done.  It could be just like a static page that's on the back end, there's no integration and Abby or Brighton or someone else would put these things in.  It would probably be faster to put out, that would also create some sort of a technical debt as we grow and oh we forgot to update this thing so ideal this is not ideal but and adding people as users to the integrity hub is not it is not trivial it just it's another layer of complexity because we need to manage users and we need to do this thing that we just did now as users for our clients like help them recover passwords and stuff like that so it gets complex really fast for now my understanding is we need to just kind of copy what what Vanta has with the header that explains our the client's commitment we need to include the controls the policies in trainings and controls policies and trainings should have some way for people to ask for more information and right now this feels like a button with an email people type in the email and there's no customization right it's it's

28:00 - A L
  Is it?

28:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I think there might be a need for this version.

28:04 - A L
  this version, I think we can just do it manually.

28:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The goal is for them to use it and see if they like it and test it out.

28:09 - A L
  And I know we will have some technical depth. I think once you have the static web page, because right now our customers are still testing it.  This is also like a, yeah. then we do risk assessment, and then you can go back and maybe fix some of the integrations and the other things later on after that.  But I think for the first one, it could just be a static page so people understand what we're talking about.  It's also good for sales as we're going through this process, especially without the regulations to be like, OK, why would we use your tool?  It's because you have this along with this. it's a, like when I show the admin portal, the employee portal, and then I'm able to show the integrity hub as part of that.  So that's good, because we need to get sales in more.

28:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so in terms of priorities, let's create another card.

29:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, but I wanted to suggest one thing regarding priorities. Can we just have a big board with five cards, like visual can be my or whatever, and just list the priorities from top to bottom, because things are starting to get confusing to me.  And I'd like to see them in order. Because first are controls, carbon reporting, that's on that side right now, the ball is okay on our side now.  And then what about the others? if you could, I mean, I can create... Third party management, I guess.

29:31 - A L
  And then it's...

29:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, before we answer that, let's create a structure for that answer to be permanent.

29:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we use this with the epics? Can we just, for instance, hide everything that is not an epics, and use the epics as the priorities?  Yeah, sure, sure, whatever.

29:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Just, I want it to be simple, and visually easy to understand for everyone. Something we can trust, right?

29:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, actually. we want to see the ethics. So right now, this is what our board represents. The highest thing is the release of V1 policies procedures and trainings.  We have controls and then we have user and group management. Apologies, third-party management, which is in progress, is also a priority.  What about dashboards?

30:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  Come again? What about dashboards for controls? Is it part of controls or? It's not here.

30:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We should put it here.

30:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  And I think it's part of it. No, I think dashboard is not part of controls.

30:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Dashboards is for everything, right? Yeah, we are. Yeah, I guess we have dashboards along with that.

30:49 - A L
  Where are we on the server?

30:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's what I wanted to check also. Is it something that we are waiting to spill on IBM Brighton or design?  I think it's now Romeo is supposed to take what Yeah, from Friday to today.

31:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay.

31:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  I just I didn't know what's what's the latest that's just okay. Okay. Yeah.

31:08 - A L
  Actually, No, you're right. I think it's risk assessment will come after dashboard and come after or come after integrity hub.

31:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, here you are. Okay. You sent it on fortified design, right? I don't design a content content. Okay. That's brightness control controls graphs.

31:39 - A L
  Perfect.

31:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm downloading this thing. Share this step. So everyone can see it. Oh, can you give me access to it, please?  Just so we leave all the information and things. So what did you into design design? one page with dash words.  OK, this is v1, right? It becomes better later. So this is the highest priority for the first three. You're not showing the sign name.

32:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  Thank you.

32:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK, coming here. OK, creates. Is it here? Add to design screen. Where did it go? So annoying. But where did it go?  Do you know how I can find this?

33:03 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I'm sorry, using search or you should be in backlog, I guess, but maybe we didn't assign it as a design.  Maybe it's in development board. Can you check it there? I don't think I can go into the development board.  And on the left side, if you click design board, on the left side, design board, left, left. In the left or menu?  Oh, here. Okay. Yeah. There. Check under Epic side. have no idea. Okay. Let's kill it.

33:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's just go back to design board and create it again. No problem. Just check if it's at the category.

33:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe it was developed or something. That's why we're a category. Okay.

34:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, just a second, open, what, okay, open, open, what, okay, okay, file, export, download, SVDF, yes, download, yes, okay, no, I want to add something.  Highest priority, right, dashboard jumps to the top. Why isn't it visible? Why matchprop, after design spring?

35:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, it's fine, I think you just need to refresh for something, I don't see if you refresh, Jira is funky sometimes.

35:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, Jira is funky sometimes you can say that. Why? So funky. Fortified software, great dashboard, design springs. It's good to me, baby, in design.  OK, that's it, probably. OK, fortify software.

36:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't get it. I don't know. Let's just create a list for now, and then we then maybe. screw it.  OK.

36:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just anywhere, anything just can be a bullet point.

36:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  It can be anything just to list the priorities. we can then go back to the point. so controls G.  Sorry, I'm missing out. So that's carbon reporting, blah, blah, asset management, if I'm not mistaken. Where are we with asset management design?  Is that completed from the design perspective or? It is yes, okay, okay Okay, okay again dashboard, I would say Then integrity hub maybe then risk management You'll see what I mean.  I'll third party manage third party management should come Yeah, I should come before The integrity hub before the integrity, okay Okay, good.  Is this happy, okay priority wise this this list are we missing something?

37:43 - A L
  Yeah, I think so the question is I can dashboards could come also after Third party because but or we just need to add dashboard third-party stuff into the dashboard That's already completed Then we can update it later

38:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  You can update their words with this stuff, and we do it so it doesn't necessarily have to be answered so it can be recorded.

38:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

38:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay, then that's how, how then from your side, I would say so controls are done, right? More or less this, yeah, sign done, then I'm done.

38:19 - A L
  then dashboard we want design, we are waiting on the design, right?

38:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's it. Okay, good. And then, yeah, that's it. so priority-wise then... Do we have any time estimates from Romeo on these, just so we can kind of...

38:36 - A L
  No, we just...

38:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and then third-party management. We just started talking about dashboard on the other things on Fridays, so we'll get the...  Yeah, I'm like, I don't expect him to be done.

38:51 - A L
  I'm just thinking like, based on what he's saying, yeah, I'm just like, like, as he could be good to know, but like tomorrow, like, it's anticipating one or two days now that he's seeing...  it and same with like third party manager as he decided a week because then we can compare it to Ivan's development time and we might need to move things around to like get him to have some stuff to be able to work on.  Do you know what mean?

39:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can have it do the two stuff the pop-up you know the onboarding for example we have that and we can work on the asset management that there we have works to do so I don't think I think.  But how many more days have worked you how many more days of work do you have? I say this week I would say at least a couple of days even I would even say probably.  Okay because you might have have PDF upload to policies instead of the text so yeah to do before when would you put it to be another don't put a job but just so that I know where would you have you put it in these numbers between which number

40:00 - A L
  I think well I think it's hard to say I would say that like obviously you should put it in if you there's not enough design work For it, but I don't know how long does it take to put in a PDF if it is a couple hours Then I would actually just prioritize it It's at least the day Is that also for training In communication it's all like we need to have upload functions from them too based on the feedback Yeah, can upload it without questions just like upload function Yeah, I would say yes it's same for all three I would say around they maybe a little bit more But I won't I don't think so if you're it should be fine Yeah, I would say like I don't know I would try to work on everything else and then if there's a break Then let's use that break to fix that because I do think we need to like rethink the entrance  for all of it and so that could just be part of the whole entrance page redo you know so yeah I would not prioritize that unless we run out of things that they which is what I'm trying to avoid but kind of the planning on the drawing so yeah I think you're fine there every week you do carbon reporting the more nice already working on the backend stuff we need asset management as I will start working on that hopefully tomorrow so we have plenty of work to do for the next couple of days and then probably that's it so I think we'll be okay there if we can then if we get the dashboard by mid one like by Wednesday have the dashboard ready then you can work on the dashboard on Wednesday Thursday while Romeo's finishing third-party management by the end of the week and then maybe you can work on third-party management on Monday or something yeah I have plenty of stuff to fix and do with if something is not that I don't think that that will happen

42:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay.

42:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right.

42:05 - A L
  Okay. Everything okay then? Uh-huh. On our side on the design side, we'll work on getting an estimate for the dashboard and start working on dashboard immediately.  Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Thanks a lot then.

42:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. We'll be in touch.

42:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Bye.

42:29 - A L
  Thank you. Bye.
