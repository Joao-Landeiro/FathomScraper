0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes indeed.

0:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You suffer a lot with allergies.

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's that? Is it difficult for you with allergies to usually have that stuff? I always have that.

0:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's really annoying. Yeah.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't use to have anything like that but here in Brazil I sometimes have it. yeah. How far away are you from the coast?

0:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What coast? Like the sea.

0:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like 20 minutes away? Okay.

0:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's it.

0:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm like 90 kilometers away so it's no sea. Anyway let's go but other than that I think you're okay right?

0:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Nice.

0:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I saw that you've pasted something about service quality. I think that was the thing.

0:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh yeah it was just... So I don't forget it. Yeah, yeah.

1:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I have something to send you afterwards, which is the five ease of experience design. Oh, that would be nice to have.  You might like this, because the serve call, I believe it's more like a quantitative sort of thing for designing services.  And because I've been doing a project which is using all of that stuff, so it's good.

1:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK, if you can illuminate me with specific knowledge about it, I will be grateful. Yeah, I'll send you.

1:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll put the notes I have in the email and maybe in the video. So today, it's planning day, right?  So I'll try to move fast. If you need to take a break or something, take some water, you are at home.  Let's move at a speed. of the light yeah nice okay so last session we arrived at the business goal definition we figured out the project boundaries do you see my screen yes you see my screen and we also developed some criteria to make it help us prioritize later today we're baking it down right they're composing it into tasks prioritize tasks and build a development plan okay so we will use that timeline project okay so based on our conversations from yesterday I've arrived at this sentence in terms of the business goal and the and then this sentence in terms of the deliverable okay let's see let's let's see if this makes sense to you okay I'm going to see at your screen and then I go back to mirror okay these my

3:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  because for v1 or I'm not reading the right sentence oh v1 version one version one okay at the end of February 25th will have a six-week program that generates revenue yes good and now going deeper into that deliverable we have the deliverable that we're considering is a community community-based online program for technology leaders that are going through change and want to unlock the next level right nice this is the form this is internal right maybe you can also use it for them because they have a kind of mind that can process it is mostly for us

4:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  this point.

4:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So this is the format. It affects everything else.

4:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If it wasn't a community, use different tools. The audience goal matters because it defines how the market will evaluate our solution and the audience affects what is the goal.  So actually, I think I should have made it like this. Okay, now it's better. Right? If you agree on this, we can move into the next step.  Okay.

4:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I agree. But I don't know if it's the best concept technology leaders. Who do you think will like?  Do you think that's a great concept? In your opinion? Like, it's talking to the technology side of the people as we defined yesterday, but is it too long or it doesn't matter?

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For no aspect, I think it doesn't matter. When you start talking to people, sometimes you don't even have to say that this is for technology leaders.  It just shows up in the way you explain the problems, in the people that you tag, in the posts.  I mean, I think technology leaders is not too long.

5:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I think we can find ways with copywriting and stuff like that to make it OK.

5:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it's best to be precise and to be super short. I would feel confident with this.

5:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK.

5:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's go down. We'll spend most of our time here.

5:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And we have a business goal, which is that thing you saw at the top. We have the end product, which is the thing you saw then.  And then we have the deliverables.

5:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the deliverables are made of several work packages, which are kind of the tasks. If we were going to be super specific like in terms of project management, these would have sub-tasks, but I don't think that it makes sense for our context.  If we were part of the same team, like working together every day, and like I'm a designer in your coding, that's the thing we were doing, it would make sense to go into tasks.  This way it doesn't make sense to go into tasks. Just to be sure, I took this stuff here, I got it from this thing here.  I will phrase them a little bit, some of them.

6:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  For instance, these two, I've made it just one, because by addressing it for one side, we will address it for the other side.

6:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this one, just left it, I think like this, just one. Support, I rephrased it. to mean support system or support processes and this what you see there is only the must have okay and if we have time we can go into the should have and now we are already stepping into the world of unpleasant decisions okay so we will be doing this in a series of short timers hmm actually let me put like a something I cannot not see all right did I tell you let me know when we start but when you tell me I was just trying to tell you that I got a I dream I dream yesterday uh someone opened my my school and took out my brains  out interesting dream wow that's dance was it the nightmare or just different now it was a nice one they're going they're installing me more creativity okay okay it's like neo yeah something like that so i was just like okay interesting nice nice omen yeah okay let's try let's try to do that let's let's do our best there so for now i think it's best if you get into the mirror because the zoom level might be too small for me yes i'm going to the zoom i'm in the okay i see that you see what i'm pointing at okay so let's just do a first one together and then we start to put up the speed right to have the circle community ready what specific things  do we need to have done, to have completed?

9:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do I start? Yeah. Can you play some beats? Oh, yeah.

9:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll put a potential funk.

9:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do I start with a circle community, right?

9:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's that? It's easier for you, we can also do that. I didn't get you. If we want to start with something else, because it's more in your mind right now, you remember it better, we can start somewhere else.  It's just a suggestion.

9:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfect, let's go. So you took a minute already for the packages. you. Comporting spaces and Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you got it so before I set up the next timer um because you're moving so fast I'd like to just check some of the things that you already did okay so you said something about email automation and affiliate program for the circle I think we said that this would be like not as high priority yes yeah so I'll just I'll not delete them I'll just empty

15:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So you can use that for something else.

15:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And another thing that I think will help you in the future, but is annoying to do now, is that do you know exactly what are the spaces that you need to do on the circle, what form?  Do you have a list of spaces you want?

15:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I haven't decided, but just, like, perhaps let me see. It's like in the first one, it's like, because I have already my community, you know, so maybe it's just changing that.  Like, I have a start here. You have that?

15:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Start here.

15:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  me put a screenshot of that. Perfect.

15:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank

16:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Where do I put it?

16:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just drop it here between the part, yeah, perfect. So we have start here, we have calendar, we have modules, we have we have resources, we have members, we have announcements, we all need more space for this.

16:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm putting another example, because there's something that might go away. So far I like that, start here, calendar for live sessions, modules as lessons, yes, do you like best modules or lessons?

17:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Lessons.

17:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so change modules for lessons. And then recordings for the workshop recordings. And then, I think, let's take out resources for now.  That's going to be in another section, like the section of the knowledge base of the program, not the actual cohort.  But in the workshop record after workshop record is let's put members and then announcements. I don't know if at the end or after it starts here.  What do you recommend?

18:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I would put announcements at the very top or maybe after the start here. Okay, perfect.

18:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And then the second one is about like knowledge base. And we're going to have the maybe discussion. I don't know what do you prefer discussion or chat.  I think the name. For now it doesn't make much difference, we can always change it later, but I'll think more about the function like you want to have a discussion so just Blocks Okay What what will you have in the video library?  Maybe like a Different inspirational videos I like from YouTube and things like that or I don't know if that like in resources I have inside resources a section of  videos and Books, you know that could be better. So I can I I want to have less and it'd be more simple You know, so we want this to take out the complexity.  So maybe resources. We have in say resources video library and book recommendations cool, so I'll just The blog is blog posts What's that?  What's blocks? Blocks, it's me writing blocks like okay, so my Okay, that's good What your suggestion may maybe my blocks can serve as a newsletter You know, but I don't know if maybe the people that wants to get in there have access to that section You know blocks and newsletter.  I don't know or maybe there's exclusive blocks and free blocks, you know, like Spotify But you have these blocks written Yes, I have tons of blocks  yes so it's going to be easy to fill it in but I'm just I can automate it to be you know deliver two three a week or once one a day things like that I already have like 45 now if you if you have that many I would leave blocks as it is so inside of not space but not inside of resources yes if you have yeah yeah it's outside right okay yes it's outside it's different let me just check in with another no let's let's say I just I it's because I take also inspiration from different sources so let me just check in it's because I'm trying to to create my own way all my experience with different courses from circle and school and things like that yeah I think so far we could stay with that I think it's it's more than enough  But Okay, we have a star here in the start here the start here is like kind of the onboarding right or do you think it's a start here?  And then another one of onboarding. No, I think it's the start here is the onboarding. Okay. And what about introduction?

22:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, I like that.

22:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I think it's good like introductions So people like it's just a section of introduction So people can know members.  It's just the actual member. know, it's not the intro. So it's different and What about course frequent ask questions like Facts or none not necessarily.

22:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you can always create those later because see what other questions are but for this version one I think you have quite, you know, quite a quite enough things now Okay, I think yeah

23:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's more than enough, so it's just making sure in... Look, I'm gonna put another one here, just to... I'm just...  I like this because I can say just I need to have this, but it's just like let's decide and give the details now, you know?  So I don't lose time there. Look, I have this one, so I don't know... Because there's lots of them that are not necessary.  I tried some of them in my own experience, we actually... Like, there's a few people that share their wins, maybe that's...  I don't know if it's interesting to push it. I know I can change this here, but also just trying to get a little bit of feedback of what you think.  Sharing the wins, know, like the progress or something like that.

24:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking I'm thinking so I would say that for now I would not put it for the simple reason that everything yeah and everything that you do now you will not need to do on the next session but if you go for the next version but if you don't do this version you'll never get the next one so just I would do if it really like a skeleton yeah simple you always have inspiration you always have access to that I'm just gonna leave here this okay so I've put a little bit more detail on the visual design like covers and graphics and because it's important to know like how many is mean it means at least 10 right seven for spaces and three for knowledge base so it becomes a little bit more tangible when you talk about  Pardoning experience and instructions. What are you thinking?

25:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What am I thinking? Like how deep because I mean, obviously it is possible to do in a very deep way.

25:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But what's like the simplest that bronze, not the golden version, not the silver version, but the bronze version of that.

25:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. I want to have like how to navigate. Okay.

25:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a good one.

25:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Navigation of the circle, telling them how to um put the word shop schedule into their calendars, you know, if they need to download something or they need to here, you know, if you want to and like have to sync your classes with your calendar, go here, you know, in the calendar section, then you would click in this and you will have access to all in one.  Introducing yourself, how to introduce yourself. Like the first one could be named community to or no, or just have to navigate circle.  You can change the name later.

26:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm using this boring names because I'm sure you'll remember what this means in the future. Okay.

26:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfect. Yes. Let's go and setting up profile. Yes. how to, it's one, it's introducing yourself and then the other one how to set up the profile, know, like put the picture, things like that, notification preferences.  And what else could be important? Yes, maybe community guidelines, like the guidelines how we're going to be behaving here.  And I think that's it, let's do not complicate this. Got it, got it.

27:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And these instructions are they text, are they video, how are you thinking?

27:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I will put like a video, I think it will be better maybe doing a loom, or maybe me just taking a video of myself, know, maybe that would be more personal.  and just a text got it perfect so on to the next one when the workshops are ready you've listed six workshops right do you have the the themes for each workshop do you know what they will be about okay so so far I've decided in two like mapping your story like storytime like that is the number one yes they're doing a mapping the  story of your life or your story time life, know, so they can see where they're coming from, like different things about it.  Got it.

29:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll take just a note here, which is make a list of all workshops and their goals. Okay, so you have this one and this workshop, when this workshop is ready, I assume that what this means is, you need a mirror or a mural, whatever.  Yes, you need the instructions or like the script with the times, like, oh, at this time, think script and  Timings? Timings?

30:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Timings?

30:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Timings.

30:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Stopput and timings.

30:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can show you how I do this. I use a spreadsheet. Amazing.

30:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Remind me if I... Okay, I'm going to take it out so it's a spreadsheet and something else. At the beginning you talked about the customer experience something.

30:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, that I've written here. Don't worry about it. I made another spreadsheet for workshop.

30:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  For workshop planning, Planning? Okay, what?

30:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And yeah, I think these are the basic things and I also think, okay, these are the basic things.

30:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  With these things you can run it.

30:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And all of them need these things. Okay? you were asking me before how long I take to make a mirror and it takes me like I said like three hours something like that so that's makes sense to assume that because I spend all my day on mirror probably takes me a little bit less than what you would take on the first few times yeah maybe I will take six hours or at least for the first one the other ones maybe start you copy and paste but okay and you still need to figure out the name of this oh number two it's about second to the number two

32:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  it's about the three seats like there are three seats this seats like i see the uh it's a million yeah the third one uh yeah just draw draw your future and this is just for now right just to have my ideas there yeah are you reinventing them now as we look like i have them correct okay you see me yes i see yeah  It's one of the first drafts of that program and the fourth one it's The four sets it's Yeah, like like mindset, but this is for set the like soul set mindset house set Mm-hmm and emotional so it just called the first set Five it's Just put really about relationships You

34:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the fifth, sorry, and the sixth.

34:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Not sure yet, but just put something about framework or priority, but it's kind of like have them build their own, like, kind of minus structure to to grow faster.

34:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, perfect. So you saw that we went a little bit deeper into this stuff, so it's set up a timer, just really, if you really try to, I'll say a shorter time, if you really try to add this detail, we can do it.  together of course that's how we rule but if you know like okay so I need a deliverable like a workbook so I need a workbook and I need a video you can just write it there okay so I'll put another song sunshine jam which I like but for for what because what we did now is that we did the first five minutes and you you wrote some stuff and then we went back into it and added more detail to it right and so now I'll put more minutes and you continue to add stuff to the ones and if you already have in mind details you can already add the details that's what I mean like for instance support systems okay I need to hire an assistant for instance I don't know if that's okay and I need to find I need to train this assistant you know you can put more  More detail into it. I think it will help you.

37:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thanks watching. I You music music music music music music music music music music music music

39:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So this one was a shorter one.

39:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Don't be scared. Perfect.

39:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we spend a little bit of time adding detail to some of the some of those that are already there?

39:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

39:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So provide my psychedelic bibliography and favorite books, videos, podcasts from sort of apps as a repository.

39:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

39:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I make, can I suggest we break these things into topics, like favorite books, videos, podcasts? I think that will make it easier to prioritize.  So books. movies. It's here, no? Ah, okay, okay, got it. Sorry. Okay. Yeah. Okay. The toolkits, what are the toolkits?

40:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How many of them are there? The ones are going to be part of the workshop, I want to, you know, have the, have you been into the facilitator, the school training, they have like this library of, let me, I'm going to put a screenshot of that.  Maybe lots of people have them, but they don't have like, you know, I want to just have like 10 simple toolkits that they can use.  I don't know if this is, these are called toolkits. Or just templates. Okay, what's That's a good question.

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I never know. I think it's a little bit personal. I think the toolkit is made of different templates. So the toolkit is like the the box is the set, right?  That's all I look at. But so that is a great opportunity to choose like what are the 10 ones that you want.  Do you know which ones? What are the ones that I want, right? If you haven't, if you don't know yet, you can just pick a note of making the list of 10.  Or maybe five, know? Why 10?

42:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you put just decide on the 10 toolkits that I'm going to provide? That's it.

42:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's better. Just decide on the 10 toolkits.

42:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because have infinite tools, you know, and it's not about having that infinite tool. So even have this kind of things, you know?  Have you heard about this? Yeah, you have everything. I don't have problem with that. I just need simplicity. And you know, this is what works best for me.  At the end, maybe the one that always goes, hopes and fears and sailboat, those are the things that I always use and they're really useful in every situation, you know, so I'm just going to recommend what's best.  Maybe you can already put hopes and fears and sailboat. And I like the, I like, I wish, I wonder.  The priority pyramid. I also like it. And I love the Moscow, the ones that you show me. You I start stop continue also.  I think for now, those are nice.

44:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this thing that we just did right now is exactly the sort of thing that it's helpful. Yes.  So we started with a big thing that we mean a lot of different tests and I know exactly what they are.  And probably you have them ready. So this is this was perfect.

44:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And if you have any suggestions on which one do you think it's nice to consider? I would love your also feedback on it.  Actually, I don't know that many because I keep going to the same ones.

44:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is this one is one that you always use? CST in Portuguese is Certeza. supposition, duvida. So, certainties, assumptions and questions, because duvida is not doubt.  Certainties, assumptions and questions. And questions. I like that. It's really good at the start of a project that you talk about, like, what do you know and what you don't know about the project, right?  You really force it to be explicit about how much you know about it. It's so easy to make and I use it almost all the time.  I'm surprised we didn't use it to ourselves.

45:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Is it the one that is called hypothesis, assumptions, confirm and not valid? Yeah, it sounds like that. Yeah, I didn't know it with that name, but yeah.

45:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to put it here also.

45:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  know it's good to have. How do you know it's not this one? I'm putting it here. Okay. Do you see it?

46:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I like this because it's been taking me a while just to decide Uh, yeah, I don't think this is the same thing Now that I see it, I don't think it's the same thing, but I like this way of thinking I like the hypothesis assumptions invalidating confirmed.

46:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think that's good because Certainties could be confirmed assumptions assumptions and questions Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see your point.

46:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  see your point. But anyway, um, they are so similar That my suggestion is that you just use the one that you are most most familiar with So if you use this one often, just use this one, you know, because it will use I use a lot Assumption mapping and empathy map.

46:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So maybe but the empathy map I don't use it for the customer I use it for myself or for a client.  So maybe we can put that empathy map Mm-hmm And also, there's one called culture map. Yeah, that's also from Dave Yes, I and also maybe in the in the in the resources section I put visual frameworks Provide provide Why why why do you want to include those because what I'm teaching also in the in the program It's about you know the the bridge between Psychedelic abstract experience and tangible results.  It's people can use visual thinking to translate the abstraction You know, so what at the end of the one of the the workshops it's about then cost creating their own framework in a way Because I see that visual thinking it's the bridge between  What I think I saw with what I'm putting in the paper so people can understand what I like in a way they can they can feel or understand and we can have the same reference of viewing things because I can tell something, but people don't see it.  It's it's a way of me translating so they to have the skill of visual thinking. It's going to be something nice.  So they don't need to be an expert in how to create new frameworks. We have visual frameworks so they can use this to OK.  Maybe I can. I like this is how I feel like if I have an image of an onion and different layers in this layer, I have this in this.  I have this in this. I have this so they can communicate their feelings or certain things. Thankfully, thanks to the framework so we provide providing visual frameworks is providing a new language for them to communicate their feelings and their.  or their thoughts and things like that? I understand.

49:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's a little bit ambitious. OK. Because it's a skill that is super valuable. I completely agree with you.  mean, every time I like to reverse engineer frameworks. So whenever I find a visual framework that I like, I try to find information about how it appeared.

49:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And it's almost always true that people have visual things in skills, almost always, but they never start from scratch.  They were used to thinking visually, and then a framework came out.

49:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's a difficult thing to teach up to a level that people can use it. And if you start teaching it, but people cannot use it, it feels like you're setting up with an expectation.  that is very difficult to fulfill unless that person is already pretty good at visual thinking. So I think that's a valuable thing to teach.

50:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm thinking of myself teaching it at some point, but I think it's his own thing.

50:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a big thing.

50:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, it could be like an actual course of some visual thinking. That's why I don't want to be a visual thinker teacher.  It's You know, I just got a book in visual thinking for me. I'm not an expert, but it helped me already like translate so many ideas that I couldn't before, you know, and now I'm teaching through writing.  Every day I'm not perfect in creating and I don't know how to draw, but it's just the ideas are more tangible and people understand me better what I'm trying to say.  So it's more to to put the voice out there, but I get you about the ambitious thing up that this is.

51:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to, when I said that this is something that at some point I might make a course on, I don't want to sound like, oh, I don't want you to do it because I want to do it.  It's not because of that.

51:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, no, no, no. I think it's kind, it's like several hours of, you know, exercises and theory and stuff like that.

51:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, so that's, that's okay. I think we I would feel a bit more comfortable if we now, instead of finishing the library of templates, tools and resources, we spend some time around making the offer a bit more specific, the offer aspects.  Is this okay? Mm-hmm.

51:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So detailed offer with bonuses.

51:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we separate these into tasks? Like the offer and bonus. Yes.

52:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

52:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll put additional bonus. Okay. So when we talk about the detailed offer, what's inside of this card? What's missing?  I mean not missing, but what's the detail?

52:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What's Okay. Detailed offer. I wonder you with substacks. Not substack, sub tasks.

52:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm going to give you an example. So at the end, the detail is not the detail. The offer is the outcome and the delivery method and the guarantee, all of these things, right?  And we have some parts of it and some parts we need to define. Right. So what's the outcome?

53:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, that's a great question. So the problem is psychedelic integration. Also the problem is not understanding what's happening in their inner process and what to do with the outer process.  So it's, in a way, reducing stress, saving time, energy, and money. And use the psychedelic insight to gain clarity and balance in life.

54:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You are writing that somewhere? Yes, I'm writing this somewhere.

54:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Just before our session, I was just asking chat GPT, please help me reflecting on the user that we found, the technology leader.  What is the problem that we actually want to... In a way, they already are using psychedelics, right? So they're coming to the psychedelic space because they want to have more performance.  But if I want to talk to the frustration, maybe their stress or their pressure, they don't know how to integrate...  produce into their life or into their performance or into their productivity or into their professional culture. they want to have a connection between what's happening inside of them and what can it help them do in their work in a way.  So they need a system to support the journey in a way. So that's why they have a method of how to understand what is the psychedelic work in a way.  one outcome is understand what is the psychedelic work about or psychedelic transformation work about. So it's about education. That's an outcome.  Like I don't know if it's an outcome, I don't see the text.

55:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, it's because I'm a blazer.

55:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So In a way, we want to save them time, energy, money, frustration, because they don't have time, you know, to read all the books about psychedelics or therapy or psychology, they just want more well-being, creativity, and performance in a way.

56:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you paste it there? I'm just trying to lend my ideas, sorry, if this is just abstract.

56:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Got it. Okay, attention. Also, okay, so. why would they want to integrate psychedelics in their life what is their any mind or the primary benefit that they're looking if they integrate this so yes it's personal and professional performance well-being and balance and amplified your leadership so they have to go they have to come clarity balance understanding performance okay I think I as of now I've  I it's this like amplify their leadership or their impact in the professional or personal life outcome like that in simple terms clarity they want clarity in what's happening they want balance in life and work life balance and psychedelic experience and moon in life balance they want understanding like what's happening inside of me and what I'm supposed to do like in a way part in understanding and purpose and with that they get performance so that's also like a result of everything that derogating from the course you know you got it so the goal is to amplify their leadership and impact the outcome is clarity balance understanding performance okay and the delivery we know because

59:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a community, a six-week community, and do you offer guarantees?

59:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's offer a guarantee. If they're not satisfied within 15 days, they get the money back. No questions asked, bro.

59:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but this is important because in 15 days that's two weeks, right?

59:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's a third of the program. Or let's just put two weeks. If this is not what you were expecting, ask for the money back and you will get it.  No questions asked, bro. But my point is, if I remember correctly,

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  directly. Guarantees are super important. Also, there's many ways of doing them, right? And it feels to me that defining the guarantee is a very sensitive aspect that maybe it's like the task in itself.

1:00:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If you're not like maybe if you're not gaining the clarity or to understand that you're looking for, we'll give them more.  But because we're promising clarity and we're promising understanding and performance, know, if you are not receiving one of these, or this is what you're looking for, or can you make an example of the guarantee that you will use?

1:00:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, I don't know which one I will use, but I'll tell you about one that somebody else was doing and I was like, okay, this is a good one.  So the guarantee was I think it was like, oh, if you don't pay back the program with the leads that you get, we give you your money back.  However, there was a bit of, there were some conditions, right? And they said, the conditions was basically their method.  They said, if you don't get the results that we promise and you have done these 17 things, we'll give you the money back.  But if you don't do the things, we don't give you the money back, all right? Which I think made a lot of sense, because otherwise we won't.

1:01:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, like kind of after doing the workshop, after you've done all the steps required, if you don't, if you're not having clarity, we'll do the money back.  Thank Yeah, like if you do the full six weeks and on the exercise and participate in the community and you still don't have clarity, we give you the money back.  But let's put that and participate, know, and participate in the community. And we don't have clarity, yeah, because at the end they want clarity, know, this is not, it's like, you know, any other product, you know, you know, a brush can clean your teeth.  But if you don't clean it, it's up to you.

1:02:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not the problem of the brush, you know. Exactly, exactly.

1:02:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh, I bought a book, this is so common. Oh, I bought a book about project management and I suck at project management.  Yeah, but did you read the book?

1:02:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I never read the book. So of course, people need to do their part, of course.

1:03:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  so and in the pricing tires let's yeah we're doing good man so in the pricing and tires it's I have the  premium why is that because let me show because it's like you choose your path you know you choose your level of support and what does that mean choosing the level of support is let me see if I can get this book let me write out I'm just in case choose your level of support because there's some people that say I just want the worships okay you you just have access to the worships but there's a guy that says I want access to the worships to the lesson recordings and to the community perfect but then you know there's other people that they want not just them  workshops or the community, but they also want a coach in one with me and group coach calls. How does that sound to you, so are you there?  I am there.

1:04:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm here. I'm here. So what I'm thinking is, if you have different tiers of pricing, you need to do different things for these people, right?  And from an operational perspective, I assume that the things that are the most valuable take the most time, right?  So in my mind, especially because it's the first one, I will do just two.

1:04:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:04:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:04:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's do two. The product premium or essential and pro which one do you like better?

1:05:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking, I'm thinking. So I'll call it the full and the pro. The full and the premium, because the thing is, we don't want people to think that they are getting less stuff, right?

1:05:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:05:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're getting...

1:05:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Nice one.

1:05:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice one.

1:05:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like that. get...

1:05:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah? Yeah.

1:05:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So... I understood it. Perfect.

1:05:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the full is everything and the premium is everything and four sessions with you, right? I don't know. Yeah.  Something beautiful.

1:05:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Okay. Okay. Let's... Do we write what's included? You know, so included it's everything. And the other one? It's everything plus coaching one-on-one and coaching  Community access for six months. There's one aspect that I think could be, okay, so I'll just say this and then I'll make another comment.

1:06:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  These guys, your clients are probably people that they throw money at the problem. They don't throw time at the problem, right?

1:06:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because they're busy.

1:06:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They have money, but they're busy. And if this hypothesis is correct that your target market throws money at the problem, not time.  What things can you do? So my point is I don't even think they need more access. I think that's the thing.  You can live in there because it costs you nothing, but it's not something that they will convince them

1:07:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, fine. I want the checking out things for six months. Let's take out the six months things What is something that it will move that will move you out, you know in an offering Oh, I'm a terrible customer to be honest.

1:07:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, I don't buy from anyone.

1:07:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't buy from anyone. I'm stingy You need to Yeah, I think it's a morning we talk so it can come back I know I agree.

1:07:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I I've been dealing with that aspect. I've been dealing with that mental block of mine I think I think because What would make me throw the money If I mean I I'm not your target market.  think but no, I know I know but you're here for the knowledge Might not right?

1:07:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's it.

1:07:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah

1:08:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Also, they want, in a way, my expert guidance in something, so one-on-one coaching sounds like a deal, but is there something more to it?

1:08:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Something more? No. I think it's less about adding stuff and more about the way you do the stuff. So, for instance, I think it would convince me more if you tell me there's four sessions with Jorge that follow a specific process, like the somatic integration, then there's four sessions with Jorge, because for me, I feel more comfortable when I understand exactly what I'm getting, because I'm suspicious of all of these selling tricks of selling courses and stuff like that, because now I see them, so everyone is using them, right?

1:08:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We see them. Yeah.

1:08:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You take off your glasses. say bye bye bye bye bye bye selling selling you know yeah we already know the matrix yeah we see we see those tricks so for me it's a lot more about I think the trust and you know connecting with my pain points and stuff and stuff like that like I had a bad experience the other day the guy was very nice the conversation was great but he was really forcing me to make a buy during the call which guy work yeah I don't want to I don't want to name names but anyway what it didn't work yes I paid him but then I was like no I cannot it doesn't make sense for me to buy this thing right now this is I think this is a good product but I don't want to buy it right now and I asked for my money back and he was okay he didn't he didn't complain but I felt really oh this was very manipulative I know that happens with me a lot with a lot of courses you know and they want to sell you 30 30

1:10:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  30k programs and I'm like, Hey, wait, why are you selling me? Stop, you know, don't sell me things. I'm just, we haven't finished the work together and you're already trying to sell me another thing.  You know, and yeah, that's bad.

1:10:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry about that. No, no, it's, uh, so we know exactly what we mean with this. So for me personally, what would convince me is like a lot of clarity, like, because you know, you, you have the luxury of having the knowledge.  So if you have the knowledge, talk about the knowledge and then it's easier. So that's one thing.

1:10:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The other thing I wanted to say is my experience, my one one integration method.

1:10:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, something like that.

1:10:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Something like that.

1:10:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm really stressing out a little bit about time now. Yes. Let's hurry.

1:10:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So let's figure it is out.

1:10:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Where can we focus best? the clear program outline okay that's clear additional bonuses I will change this task and I'll call it come up with three now two additional bonuses okay no more than that just you to figure a couple deliverables maybe workbooks yeah I don't I don't think you need a workbook because the deliverable is is like the the recording of the session and the access to the mirror you don't need to make more stuff I think you have a lot of stuff that you can put in the package so let's go into the support systems to to analyze this hire and train an assistant do you have a list of assistance already do you up  So it's just a matter of picking somebody from that from the belief that's correct How much time do you think you'll need to train them?

1:12:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Could I need two hours? Okay the psychologist as a team member is this I already have it and she doesn't in training it's just so maybe when I was thinking about the one-on-one also like access to the therapies if they were you know it's the review if they need it but I don't know if it put it because also like psychedelic integration it also like open up things you know and I'm not that you're not coming to me to talk to me about your problems like emotional problems yes we can talk them but if you need more deeper  deeper support, we have our psychologists. That's very good, for emotional support.

1:13:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so you have this person already, so this task is done, right? Yes.

1:13:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so done.

1:13:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this one is in progress, which is good. So, keynotes and classes, design the keynotes, record the views. How many keynotes are there?  Six keynotes?

1:13:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, no, it's like, I'm trying to do like four classes, three or four classes of ten minutes for each lesson or module.  So, it's going to be six lessons. this yeah six models yeah the work like the models are are like pretty quartered because that's the theory and the words of it's like actual hands on okay okay record the videos just also this okay upload it in the circle perfect this should not be complex four times six is what 34 right 34 videos yeah i can i can do that in like two days yeah record the videos time six right yeah but will you already put that right no i will cut  It's recorded about design record.

1:15:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, it's yeah, it's so I'll delete it. Okay, cool. Keynotes and classes. Cool. So I'll delete this one.  Great design. Jorge's frameworks. Tell me more about this and I'll put a timer to help us both. This one.  Design Jorge's frameworks. Jorge's frameworks.

1:15:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh, it's it's not deciding. think I already have them. It's just like deciding, not deciding, deciding on my frameworks that I'm going to use for the classes.  You know, with you already did some and I then I did some and there's some frameworks that I use, you know, like, like change.  management models that I use for to explain my the psychic journey and things like that. Do you have a goal for that?

1:16:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you have a minimum number?

1:16:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, when it's the cycle of the training side, they look like training or learning cycle from learning or and training cycle.  Yeah, that's one pushing the envelope the road like the road or the path to mastery El radar de las heridas, it's like the wounds radar.  Inner process and outer process helix. The cycle between a state of consciousness, a state of consciousness cycle. El The funnel of the levels of consciousness.  The bridge. What do you call the, like, I don't know. It's not a mind map. It's like when you go from a function to another function to another function.  It's just like the user.

1:18:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's that?

1:18:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like the journey map.

1:18:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but it's not the journey map.

1:18:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's like the user functionality. There's a name of it. A diagram. From vision to reality. any diagram. The hero's journey, and the future's gone, like the count of the future you know too.  And the stages of integration. And just a last one could be the, the, the twin cycles or the Ecosycling, but it's like a loop, like infinite, infinite loop of, of, of growth.  The, the, the tree cycle of growth. And so far, I think we are good.

1:20:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. So I'll put this as done because they're selected.

1:20:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:20:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for now, you'll see me speaking faster and faster and faster. We'll take all of these things and let's just put them all into the to-do status.  To-do. I sound like one of the things to do. yeah. So we have these things. And now we bring all of these tasks and we place them.  It's talking like I was listening to some music that had somewhere else, Jackson. I got this in my mind.  Copy, paste, I'll make this a little bit smaller so we can reorganize them and I'll bring you to me.  Come to me.

1:21:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Not yet, sir.

1:21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, not yet, not yet. Okay, I'm ready.

1:21:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ready to go.

1:21:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  so...

1:21:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Take me with you.

1:21:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's go, come with me, hold my hand. So, the idea here is the following. Basically, the things we've done the most, we are better at knowing if we know how to do them, of course.  And the things we don't want to do, even if we've done them... a lot we won't do them especially people like you and I creative and you know so the idea is that you take this stuff and you place it place it on a matrix so here low experience high enthusiasm it's okay the best one is high experience and high enthusiasm oh i'm really good at selecting frameworks just that's the perfect zone i hate let's say you say i hate putting together course outlines okay that's problematic but we can work with that and later as we do that we can figure out external suppliers that we add to those tasks these will be the people that you just hire and they do this this thing for you okay so i think it will be faster if we just if you just drag the things into their position and only talk only talk about it if it's really a different thing that is a bit unexpected okay  I'll put a three-minute timer, four-minute timer, and I'll put an agitated tone to influence you, okay? Is it clear the task?  I think it's quite clear, sir.

1:23:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's go.

1:23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's go, daddy. You you It's okay if they overlap, boom, the man is fast, the man is a legend.  Okay, so from this stuff clearly you're not too excited about setting up the circle space, which is useful information, you need to hire and train the assistant, but that's not very interesting for you, and provide a psychedelic bibliography question.  Why is this something you're not enthusiastic about? A lot of which one?

1:27:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  provide the second type of bibliography. Oh, what? This one?

1:27:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, yeah. You said you're not very enthusiastic about it.

1:27:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, it's because, you know, organizing it and writing in the computer, you know, everything that it's about programming, like technical things, I don't think it.  If someone is asking me and I'm telling you, okay, this and this and this, I provide the information, you organize it, you know, like I have my information, but you organize it, I don't want to organize it, you know.  Okay, okay, understand. So to look clean and things like that, you know.

1:27:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. And you are quite excited about this. You haven't done it yet, but you're quite excited. And this stuff, you're enthusiastic.  It's funny that you're clearly a person that like new things because the things you are most excited about are not things you that you have done the most.  It's just just a pattern. Okay, so about this, how would you...

1:28:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  don't like to do the same. That's a thing that I have found out about me. I don't like to repeat things that I've done in the past, know, that I know I'm like not the best but I'm good, know, like it's like it does, you know, challenge me in any way.

1:28:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you like to figure out new things, right? Yes. Yeah, I can see that. Then it gets boring. Cool.  So of all of these tasks, and remember what you've said about the budget and the time and all of these things, if you could hire external help to take them off your plate, like they will get done but not by you, which tasks would you hire help for?

1:29:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you repeat the question?

1:29:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if you could hire somebody to help you with some of these tasks, and this person does the thing, you don't need to worry about it, they just do it, right?  Which tasks?

1:29:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. No, but I need to teach them, know, I'm going to do it in a way, you know.

1:29:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's no way of hiring external help. I can hire, but I need to tell them what to do.

1:29:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So at the end, for them to learn, it's I need to do it in front of their eyes.

1:29:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

1:29:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I don't know how can that work, because also all of this, I'm just going to do it once and that's it.  I know I have to do it. I'm just not excited. Yeah.

1:29:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Cool. So in this case, because it's the first run, you don't have a team yet, they would know already this  things you would just accept that yeah I'll have to do it and that's it perfect so in that case we'll just bring this all of these things let me just close you this we'll just just bring all of these things and we place them here I will bring you to me bring everyone to me so I'll place them here okay and now we need to organize them in sequence okay and this will be quite a bit of stuff okay so first thing I'll do is to remove these these example tasks okay and this one is about workshops and let's change the color all the ones that are about workshops I'll put them in that blue color so this  Yeah, it can be this color, can be this color, can I select several, I cannot select several this, it's unfortunate, okay, this is also a workshop, this is also a workshop, this is also a workshop, all the workshops are together, yeah, make a list of workshops 2, 3, workshop 4, workshop 5, workshop  Okay, so all of these are about work jobs. We'll look at the ones that are about the library, the offer, kind of green, the offer.

1:32:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's put it this way.

1:32:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Select, come up with two, edit bonus is also an offer. This part is boring, I know.

1:32:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But it's not necessarily, when you produce the music, you like, you love to get the beats going, but there's some technical things that you need to do that.  Yeah. What else is there?

1:32:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Detailed offer, come up with additional bonuses. Okay, perfect. So the offer is done.

1:33:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What do you think what delivers the most value for my program? Now that you're getting close to my program and what I'm trying to do, what do you think it's the most valuable thing that I can give to my client?  I think it's the integration.

1:33:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like what do expect from the integration process?

1:33:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like the methodology and the lesson, the teaching, everything, you know, that's the knowledge. Yeah, yeah, but okay, I want to answer in a way that's more helpful to you.  You have the knowledge and you have the knowledge balanced out with other things.

1:33:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I feel that for me, the biggest value would the certain predictability about what I should expect from a psychedelic experience.  Because I'm a , I'm always scared about this stuff, so for me that would be very nice.

1:34:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But for other people maybe it's a different thing.

1:34:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does it make sense to you?

1:34:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, this is going to be pure integration, it won't include the psychedelic experience itself, but I think, we'd thank for your answer.  No, no problem. So, create candles for impact.

1:34:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, this is the green one. clear program outline. That's also a offer thing.

1:35:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:35:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  course, let me know. The keynotes. I think just with that we have a path a lot, you know. Yeah, I feel that to me it's a little more clear exactly what needs to be done by visual frameworks.  It's a lot of things, right? It's sometimes surprising like how much stuff is behind every task Like oh, yeah, I want to do this, but then what does it mean?  Oh, it means a lot of things Uh knowledge page I think this one is No, this is not that this is the circle The circle is the red one The circles go to at the end because I know I have to do it and I will do it But it's just I want to finish the first things first So higher psychologist is a support thing and I thought I've got also about doing the webinar Um provide my psychedelic library.  I believe this is like this Okay, I need to have also myself system

1:37:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  webinar and cell system. I forgot about that.

1:37:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, we need to add that. Where's the visual stuff? Oh, that's the red one. Okay, here, cool. Yeah, all of them are here and now we need to add the webinar cell system.  that it? Webinar Sales system. Okay, this will be a big one and I'll mark it with a strong red one because I have no idea what this entails.  Okay, so now we need to spread out things across time. Some of them could be parallel, some are not.  If you're doing everything your own, yourself, let's first think about how much time they need. Okay, so this one.

1:38:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How much is it?

1:38:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Table view.

1:38:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Make a list of all the workshops.

1:38:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How much time do you think this takes?

1:38:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I've been trying to do that for quite a while and I haven't actually defined that. It's about making the list, it's about defining.  Defining the outline. Do we have the clear program outline? I don't know if that is first because with the clear program outline, I can go out and then choose the workshops, right?

1:38:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, correct. So, now that I see that there was a much better way of doing this thing, I don't usually use this function on a mural.  So, detailed outline, this one, right? Yeah, perfect. Exactly, yeah.

1:39:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's a high priority. Cool.

1:39:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:39:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What's that?

1:39:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no, no, that's...

1:39:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Where's the clear program on that? Here? Detailed offer. Yes. And with that, the workshop, it will take me... Once I define this, I think it will take me just an hour to define the list of the workshops and their goals.  No, maybe two hours.

1:39:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think this is in days, okay? So... It's in days?

1:39:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:39:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's do it one day.

1:39:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah. a date? Is it possible or just put one day in each?

1:40:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I never tried that, but maybe you can overlap them. Let's, instead of doing all of them, let's see how the system works.  I'll shift back to this thing. The time one, okay. Today is the 13th, and you can start working on this.  I think, actually, I think you can start working on the 13th, right? That's when you come back from the 15th.  So this one will be here. That's when things start, right? This should take you a day. clear program outline is a day.  Okay, and detailed offer. Is it day at the moment? Okay. Make a list of all of the workshops after that is a day.  It's the same day, maybe. Are you comfortable with this?

1:41:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes.

1:41:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then each workshop, let's just take all of these guys. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank Thank you. So let's not be overly optimistic.  Just spread spread them out a little bit. I'm here man. Okay, come up with two additional bonuses. So let's start, let's go back to the table view and select the high priorities.  which all of the ones that you see that are high priority, just put it on high priority, please.

1:42:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That dies.

1:42:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can do the team and just do the high priority. Okay. So you're bringing them up. Whenever they are up, they are high priority.  that it?

1:43:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

1:43:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, this is a question of mine.

1:43:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ah, yes. think it's the ones that I need to tackle first. Okay.

1:43:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And everything else is less prioritized. Okay. So this is a library. This is lessons. to this circle, to this circle, to this circle, to this to this support, I remembered this.  This is support, and this is webinar, which is like this whole thing. Okay, now we sort by descending, create a canvas for impact.  believe this is library, this is library as well, webinar cell system is the web in R. Cool. About, there's two at the end that don't have any priority setup.  Got it. So if you do a little bit of a smell test, does this make sense, intuitive sense?

1:45:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, and it seems that I can finish it before January.

1:45:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, if you move really fast, I think so.

1:45:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I will test it, bro.

1:45:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  will test it because I think I appreciate it if I test you, so I will test it.

1:45:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You will have a taste of my power and capacities. So, okay, is this or the by by yeah it is right it is ordered by so we need to select frameworks but i think they don't have this all of those don't date sir okay let's put all of them on december 15 because nothing begins before december 15 right it's because the problem is that i need to decide decide because i have so many things in my mind that i want to do i need to decide and just test test i don't know why it's been so hard this time you know i okay maybe i have so so many things that i haven't see that i know they're powerful when i need to be patient with me you know i cannot fly you know i'm a human being so yes okay i know what you mean like earlier today i had so many ideas

1:47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  same time I could not sit in my chair. I needed to walk around the house because I had too much energy.  Okay, so this stuff, I don't think it's ordering, filter, order, sort by priority, ascending. Oh yeah, it's descending, correct.  So the things at the top are the highest priorities. We are good on that. Your frameworks to select them.  Okay, I will need, I'm so sorry, I will need to go. Okay, no worries.

1:47:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, let's figure out what to do.

1:47:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is my suggestion on what you can do. then I'll ask you to just send me a message and say, check it out.  But just drag these things to how long you need to take, but keep in mind that this white thing and this gray thing, that's a whole week.  And so maybe you have some blockers there for Christmas and stuff like that. But like, record the videos for now, record the videos taking how much time?

1:48:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I can record all the videos in a day or two.

1:48:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay. So, yeah, I really, really got to go because I have something coming up right now. If you find the blockers, just record the Loom video, send it to me and I'll get to you ASAP.

1:48:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, that sounds perfect.

1:48:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. No, no problem. This was exciting. Wow.

1:49:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We did some interesting things. We did, we did.

1:49:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Okay, I got to go.

1:49:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you so much.

1:49:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I love the, the test me, test me. So, yeah, let's test you. And what's important is that at the end, you get that thing you want.  So you'll get it. Of course. Thank you, Joao. Thank you so much. a nice one. Thank you.
