0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, wait. We didn't do this right. We didn't do this right. You did laugh.

0:11 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Hello, hello, hello. How are you? Well done, sir. Well done. I'm learning from the best.

0:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's happening?

0:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh, that is funny. That is good. Og það er að það er

15:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah.

16:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Það ennig að hérna.

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would forget, for sure. My wife gets on my own. It's not good. I literally just will go full brain power into this, and I just will, I will forget.  It's terrible, but I don't know.

17:46 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  How I just made the decision that I'm probably 80% of the way there, and I just need to now see better at what I say.

18:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe change the slides, but it's all there. It's all there. It needs to be all there. Otherwise, I'll just keep doing this.  I will admit that our conversation was remarkably helpful because after I left and came back, I make this memorable, and I just simplified it.

18:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  And I think my, at least for me, my format makes it easy.

18:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The threes, like you'll see the threes, makes it easy.

18:37 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  And I just think it was very helpful. for me as Thank you. Okay. You start today. I start today?  Okay. So here's, I have the speech. I don't have the slides. have the speech. I don't have the slides.

19:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yes that's correct that's a correct statement so this is obvious can i let me say something is um the word complex problem is like we all want to believe that we still we do complex problems right it's like i want to work with open-minded people everybody wants to say they're open-minded like i bet 95 of the world would say oh i'm open-minded but  I like how you define what a complex problem is. You do that in your Imagine. I remember in one of our conversations, we were talking about the abstract, and you said a better expression was nonlinear.  And maybe nonlinear is because people confuse complex with hard, and it's not the same thing, right? That's correct.

18:25 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  So maybe nonlinear, it's something that gets you like, hmm, what do you mean with this? Yes, yes, yes. I love that.

18:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you also said something last week, remember? It was like, I make thinking physical?

18:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Workshops are thinking made physical, something like that. Yeah, like, that is the most amazing line right there. Workshops are thinking made physical.  I love that, right?

18:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love that.

18:53 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I don't know how to put it. Because you're defining it. like, you want to know what a workshop is?  Think of workshops are thinking made physical. It's like, oh, oh, that's interesting. That's cool. Now I get it. You'll see.  You see it all over the place. And that's how you attack nonlinear problems, right? That's your thesis.

19:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So I don't say if you can do this, it's a good sign. And then I say it makes sense because that's how you solve nonlinear problems.  Okay. Then maybe I say nonlinear problems are everywhere. I'm not sure about this part. When I say nonlinear, complex problems are everywhere, like clients asking for things they don't understand, clients their own systems in practice that don't make sense.  I don't think this is adding too much to it.

19:38 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Well, not if you say, if you change it with nonlinear, it's different, right? Yeah. Because you are right. Because complex and hard, right?  We all want to know complex. But when you say nonlinear, like that, that is not because I have problems that I solve that are sequential, right?  Because that's what nonlinear really means is, right? It's some version of sequential. Yeah. Non-linear is a great word. That's a really, really good word.  Yeah, I got it from you. You said it.

20:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, you said it on the first, second conversation. So the characteristics of these problems, I think four is too much.

20:23 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Four is always too much.

20:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I'll just say connected, unfamiliar, and conflicting goals. I think this whole, okay.

20:47 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Workshops are thinking made physical, right? Because non-linear, basically what saying is like, non-linear problems don't require a linear solution.  And I like the ending because you're like, make it tangible. How do you make it tangible? Well, you write off something small.  You focus on one. It may be a decision. It may be an outcome. It may be, what was the phrase you just used?  It may be something.

21:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I take it like this. Squarity or a decision or a plan or an artifact. Perfect.

21:24 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Okay. So in my brain, in Artifact, that was the word you used. That's a really good word. In my brain, when you were talking, was like, all right, what's the difference between a workshop and a meeting?  And so I like when you said, when we talk about thinking physical or even where your concept is like, I want to know the difference between a gateway offer.  Because I know that that's like one thing, like a gateway offer, a workshop, and a meeting. Like a strategy session, right?  There's a difference between those three things. The game. The gateway offer, the small offer, is designed to build trust to get you to the larger offer, right?  The meeting is a strategic session with boundaries. Actually, you didn't use the word constraints, but that's what I heard in my head, which was the word constraints.  A meeting is an ongoing or a time-bound conversation designed to meet an agenda. A workshop is thinking made physical.  Why it's different than these two and why you see it all in the wild, which is called a workshop, is this.  This is why it solves non-linear problems. I don't think we're changing anything. I think it's just you're just cutting out the complexity.

22:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, I think the complexity is the nerd in me trying to talk about this stuff. One of the things that I think that's useful, like comparing workshop to what people know, like workshop versus a meeting or versus an offer or versus a webinar, I think it's useful to illustrate in which ways they are different.

23:24 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, you follow Alex Smith, right? Alex M.H. Smith? Yeah. He talks about that familiar but different, right? Weirding the normal?  Uh-huh.

23:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maya, most advanced yet acceptable.

23:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Uh-huh.

23:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll make it to you for this for sure. So I'll take away the complex.

23:49 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  No, don't take it away, just shrink it. Yeah, yeah, Don't turn it into a lecture, right?

23:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not a point.

23:56 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I felt like it was a point. You're not trying to make it a point. You're trying to, that's a step.  It's setup. Yay.

24:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just a setup. Okay. Final thing. Question. When I mentioned the paradox of solving real stuff that no one understands what it did, is this useful for the context of the conversation?

24:17 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I laughed. I think I laughed when I heard it. I don't know if it's useful, but it's not not useful.  Meaning it aligns with the nonlinear problems, right? That anytime you use the word paradox, it has some framework associated with it, and your framework is workshop, the style of workshop.  I think it's in the middle. Okay. I would like... The only other thing that I would love is an example of a workshop somehow.  Here's why I say this. You know the guillotine post that you had? Mm-hmm. You're cutting out the... Like, to me, that is so tangible.  That's so cool. I'm assuming that was for a workshop, right? Yeah, that's, like, a really good example, because I don't think of a game offer.  I don't think of anything else as, like, a game, right? It's like, oh, like, that's a really, really cool thing is facilitation, because in that, because that's really what you're, like, facilitation.

25:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Yeah, for sure. We need an example. Something that people already know, right? Did I break it? No, I think, no, no, no, didn't break it, because I'm thinking about, okay, what do people already know, and I think if I get a picture of people, like, playing around with the business model, on Canvas in a group, they get it, because everyone has been to, like, some startup weekend, whatever, where people do that.  And they will understand, oh, yeah, there's an expertise, there's a model, and there's an experience around it. Okay.

26:12 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  When you productize with workshops, you're basically saying, here's one way to productize one of your offers by using workshops.  Is that a question? Yes, that's a question.

26:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so that's my challenge. I think it's similar to the thing that you faced with the name, which is, I don't think I have time to both explain the workshops and how to productize with them.

26:40 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, but that's okay, because I can now, once you describe what workshops are, my brain can lead the breadcrumbs to say, there is a way to productize with them.  I'm curious now. Yeah.

26:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I'm trying to do, especially with how to get started a bit at the end.  Yeah. Yeah.

26:59 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah. Yeah, so- You have a leading, so you have a leading title, which is Productize with Workshops. What I'm going to do is I'm going to articulate what and why workshops are valuable for solving non-linear problems.  And I am going to leave the open loop, which is, oh, I can productize with them. Follow me or learn from me for more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. How long was that? didn't time it.

27:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the times I've been doing it, it has been around 11 minutes or so.

27:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  11, yeah.

27:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that's fine. But now I think I'll need to marinate on this or let this marinate. I never know what to say.  You can tell me yours and I'll just make notes.

27:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I also think my last thing will be, like, when you have visuals. It would have answered my questions probably sooner.  So also take it with a grain of salt, is I'm trying to visualize it in my brain, whereas I know the way in which you operate is you plant the seed, right?  You specifically draw the diagram to encapsulate the visual. Yeah, yeah. So throttle back my statements, some of them.

28:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The other day I was reading that book, the Write Useful Books book, and I think I've mentioned how nonvisual it is, and I think it doesn't need to be.  It works really well, because I think the guy got it really dialed in. And I'm pretty sure that that was a very conscious decision to just keep everything on the text.  And I think that if you solve it on the text, then the visuals amplify it. If you rely on the visuals...  It's good, but not as good as it could be. Let me just get a piece of paper to write down that is going to happen.  Okay. Thank you, by way. You're welcome.

29:33 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm actually going to just do the whole – I'm doing – I'm doing present mode all the time. I'll just do it from here for now.  Okay. Let's see. It works. Wait, does it still change? Hold on, let see. Oh, it does still work. Okay.  Okay. Thank you. Do you have, are you going to put your stuff on the screen, like your written word, you are?

30:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, no, I'll put the, like a visuals framework, slides, I'll use slides, yes. Okay.

30:20 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  All right. Let me time this. Just see. You want me to time it on this side? No, got, I got one, I got one right here.  The word value is broken, and it's price that's paying for it. All right. And the reason why I articulated it this way is because bottom line up front, you cannot change the price, you must change everything around it.  And the biggest thing that lives around price, the thing that's most associated with the word price, is the word value.  Now we all use that word. word. We anchor to it, like we defend our prices around it. But I don't think that we've actually really stopped to ask, what does value actually mean?  Because value and price will forever be linked, right? There's the famous formula, right? Price must be less than value, right?  And obviously that must be, and price must, oh, I missed that one. I'm going to cut that actually out.  Hold on, pause for a second. Pause for a second. I have the wrong one up, but that doesn't help.  Sorry, João. No problem.

31:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hold on.

31:40 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I have old notes. Oh, I'm we did this. I'm very glad we did this. Yeah. The word value is broken, and it's price that's paying for it.  Now, what I'm going to tell you this whole time is this one statement, is you can't just change the price, you must change everything around it.  Why does that relate to the word value? Value and price will forever be linked. We all know this. We say the value all the time as it relates to price, but we even use the word value as associated with our services, our offers, our designs, whatever that may be.  The word value itself is confusing. It means absolutely everything, and it means absolutely nothing. And I'm serious, and I'm going to tell you why about that.  Because... Why? What is going on here? I have this slide in here. You can't just change the price. You have to change everything around it.  And one of the biggest things around it is value. We all use the word value. We anchor to it.  We defend our prices. We've never really stopped to ask, what does value actually mean? We assume it's clear, concrete, stable.  But it's not. It's stretched, it's bloated, and it's overused. And when the meaning breaks, price starts to wobble. It changed the intonation, so I don't know.  you reading it for some reason? For some reason, I thought I had written something down. I'm just... It doesn't feel right.  Something just doesn't feel right. This version was edited on Friday. Is this the one? No, no, I am, you know, this is right.  This is the right version. I just, for some reason, as I'm going through this, it doesn't, you know, like when you, it just doesn't feel right.  just doesn't feel right. No, but just go through it and then we...

34:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right.

34:15 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, I'm going to keep going right here. All right. The word value is broken and it's price that's paying for it.  What I'm, what you're going to walk away with here is that you can't just change the price. You actually must change everything around it.  the reason I'm actually talking about value is because the words value and price are the most linked words associated.  Nope. But these two words are persistently associated and will forever be linked. All right. Now, the thing is, the reason why I'm talking about the word value is because I just no longer understand what it means.  Like, it's like words like strategy is I thought I once know it, but the more I say it, the more I don't understand it.  And I do think that we all use the word value. I've used it on podcasts. I've had conversations with people, even my own clients or...  And even online LinkedIn, I just see the word all over the place. And I really have just been thinking critically from first principles, breaking it entirely down to think about this word value and as it associates with price.  And so what I want to say to you is up to the point, at some point when you start your business, like it's easy to kind of just talk about price and to talk about value because you have so many other things going on.  But price early on, it's easier to do. It's easier to settle on. It's easier to raise, right? Because there's no actual inherent – there's nothing behind it, right?  But at some point in your business, when you're kind of done playing small and you really want long-term pricing, the word value needs to change, right?  João, I'm making a mental note. This is not connecting right here. This slide no longer connects. It's bothering me.  Okay. So fix that thing. So here's what I want to share with you why I think value is actually broken.  Three obvious statements as to why value is broken. So we treat the word value as it's an objective, even assumed truth, but it's entirely subjective.  Let me give you an example here. If I were to ask you to pay me $10,000 and I can give you $25,000 back, that feels, that seems like it's $15,000 worth of value.  Objectively speaking, I could say $25,000 minus $10,000 is $15,000. That's how I would see it. But the problem is you, the other hand, may not know me, right?  You may have no context as to how I go about doing it, and you just don't trust me. So despite it being $15,000 worth of value in this formula, it's a risk to you.  It doesn't feel valuable, right? It's subjective to the buyer. It's subjective to the prospect. Value is totally dependent, and it is totally in the eyes of the buyer.  So while sometimes when we go into sales conversations, or we go into pricing our services, considering, oh, look at all the value that we're actually putting into our services, value doesn't mean anything to us.  It only means something to our buyer. And so even if I were to say, if you give me $10,000, I could turn it to $25,000, that may not be a value at all to you, right?  The second reason why the problem with value is that we treat value as though it's absolute, but it's entirely contextual and relative.  I gave you the example that of $10,000 turning into $25,000, even if you were to agree, It was $15,000 worth of value.  Now it has no value relative to the second option, which is $10,000 to $25,000, because value itself is used to compare.  It is relative and it's contextual. So in these two examples, basically what you can prove is that value is not absolute.  Value is always comparative. It's always contextual. It's always relative. And the third reason why value itself has no meaning anymore is that we use it as a catch-all phrase, right?  We use the word value as though it actually means something, but it has multiple definitions. Right. There's perceived value, contribution value, replacement value, market value, lifetime value, intrinsic value.  All of these are modifiers. The word value itself is actually too vague. And so when the word value that is closely related with price is not working, how can you actually expect to price it accordingly?  And so your value, if you want to, if you want to price, right, if you want to price with any power, if you want to price with any real impact, the definition of value must change.  So let me give you three frameworks or three ways in which you can actually rewire the word value in your brain and your client's brains to control your price.  The first one is let's go back to that. Treat value like an objective or assumed truth. Right. My statement would be to go through the exercise of starting with price.  Now, you may look at me and be like, well, that's crazy because you're telling me that if I can't just change the price, I need to change everything around it.  This is an exercise. What I'm saying is, is put a number on the board. Put five numbers on the board, right?  What is the price that you actually want to charge? $5,000, $10,000. And then ask yourself, what are the conditions that need to be true to support this price?  And what this does is it changes your lens from a subjective nature, right? You are actually from an objective nature, and it actually changes it to look at from the client's lens to be a little bit more subjective.  Put a number of $5,000 and design everything around that would need to be true in order for you to hit that price.  Do you have to change the offer? Do you have to change the positioning? Do you have to change the business model?  What do you have to change in order to make this true? The second option, and the second non-obvious way, is to act like a scientist.  Now, I say this is because we treat value like it's absolute, and we use to compare. And so what we do is when we go into our discovery calls, or we go into our sales calls, we walk in with a confirmation bias that we have a, right, we're trying to square peg around whole.  The value that we actually provide is not ours to contextualize. It's our buyers. So instead of walking in trying to assume that you can solve the problem, that your solution solves their problem and act like a scientist, try to disprove the fact that your value, right, that you don't actually even have value instead of going to confirm your bias.  The third way to change and rewire the value itself is to, as I would call, never let value run naked.  And maybe you're conjuring images of Will Ferrell in old school, but what I'm saying is that for every single time you use the word value, use a modifier, or even better yet, ban the word entirely.  Because when you do that, you actually make the outcomes more concrete in the buyer's mind or in the prospect's mind instead of using it as a catch-all.  And so these are, this is actually one way to rewire the brains. You can start with price, you can act like a scientist, or you can never let value run naked.  And that is to use a modifier or to ban the word entirely. Because if you change the lens of value, right, if your lens or use of value is broken,  Then your pricing is broken too, but value is broken because now you can actually fix it with clear framing, unbiased discovery, and concrete language because you can't just change the price, must change everything around it, and it actually starts with the word value.  right, I'll stop there.

41:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. How do you feel? How do I feel?

41:28 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I feel like I didn't run through it today, and I have – didn't like it at all. I like – here's what I like.  Here's what I like. Here's what I like. I like the three. I like the example. I like the solutions.  I don't like anything as to how I set any of it. I don't like any of the story. Okay.

41:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so – Can you share the screen again?

42:02 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yes, I can.

42:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, this is the cover. All right. Okay. This one, I think it's useful to have a little bit of a setup, because it's obvious that people always want to, you know, increase prices, or it's likely that people always want to increase prices, but I think it's useful to make it very explicit here.  Like, if you think about, I'm going to suggest three levels of correcting this. The first one is a bronze one.  So, the bronze option to correct this, it'd be like, you want to charge more, but you can't just change price.  This slide, this sentence, it feels like it comes after a however or a but. Or it's in opposition to something, and if you put the thing, the opposition, I think, becomes stronger, the contrast becomes stronger.  So I think that would be like the bronze option, it would be to add, like, you want to charge more, but you can't just change price.  Maybe there's other more elegant ways of doing it, but that's all it comes So on the next slide, slide number three.

43:27 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Value and price. I don't think I need this. To be honest, I don't think I need this.

43:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think, or at least remove the forever link. Either take away the slide or remove the forever link.  I think it's not a wow slide. It's a setup.

43:44 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I don't think it's needed. The whole intro, like, the fact that I just flew through slides, I actually don't like that.  Because it limits my ability to kind of just go off the cuff if I want to. Because it's like, all right, now I got to go back.  I've already said this thing. Not that I will go off the cuff, but it's not used. It's not needed.  Okay.

44:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the word value is broken. I'll use the word value. I would say, like, every time you use value, you use the word value, and you're referring to the word, I'll put it between quotes, or just change the formatting, because I think that primes the reader to understand, and always talking about the word, not the meaning.  word. Yeah.

44:32 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah. I also, it's so ironic, because I don't want to actually use the word value in this conversation. I want to try to minimize it.  You can be obvious about it.

44:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You can start by using it a lot, and then eventually, you say, okay, now I'll stop using it, and then, like, I don't know, halfway through, or last third of it.  And that would be amazing, because then it shows that there's all ways of thinking about it. Okay. If you're done playing small, what do you want to say with this?

45:09 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It doesn't come across right anymore. So here's what I wanted to do. right. Here's what I wanted to and I didn't.  It's like, bottom line up front, right? Here's the title, whatever. I need a statement, contrasting statement, right? Because here's the bottom line.  Like, here's your takeaway. You can't just change the price. You must change everything around it. When I say everything, right?  So the word everything, you must change the value. I think the word everything is going to be confusing here.  Because that's not what I'm saying. I think I'm trying to get too fancy. the everything to be easy. What I'm saying is like, you can't just change the price directly.  You need to change the business mechanics behind it. You need to change the positioning, right? In order to justify the actual prices, you need to change the positioning or you need to change the outcomes or you need to change the buyer.  You need to change the perception. That's really what I want to say. And in order to do that, it all hinges on this word, like value.  It's not just the word itself, but it's actually the meaning behind it. Okay. And what that word actually means, like the word value, it's just overused.  Okay. Okay.

  So the problem people, let's see if I got this right. The problem that I believe people are trying to solve by attending your talk is to price better.  They feel that they are not pricing as well as they could, and there are ways of pricing better. That's my assumption of, like,  I get out of watching this, right? Yeah. But pricing better, it's more complex or it's more nuanced than it could feel like.  And people that understand these nuances then get stuck with the simplistic advice, right? Like you read somewhere that you could just double your prices and you get really pumped up.  And then you go open the slides where your proposal file, and you cannot bring yourself to change the value because there's something in you that, you know, is holding you back.  Like, I don't think I can do this, right? So there's, I'm assuming, and you know if this is true or not, but I'm assuming that some people can understand clearly that they could price things differently.  People might have a feeling of how to solve that, and one of the simplistic advice is just like double your...  But then you, as a specialist, you know that there's a more nuanced thing, which is like the pricing hesitation or something like that.  Because the three exercises you suggest, they act as ways to solve that pricing hesitation. That's the transformation I get from watching your presentation.  I get actionable things I can do to deal with that pricing hesitation.

48:36 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  The juxtaposition of three obvious statements with three non-obvious statements. You're right, okay. Let's go back to its core, which is I could have gone through the process of just saying how to improve your pricing.  What are the tactics to improve your pricing? But really what I think I'm saying is in order for you to improve your pricing, in order for you to do this long term, able improve you Here Here's  Not just surface level, change my rates and so forth, but I mean like fundamental long-term pricing strategy that supports your long-term business model, not just like a short-term blip, is that you need to change your relationship with the word value.  Now, I think we've all read the books themselves, which is like value-based pricing, or we've all used the word on countless occasions and different variations of the word value to our clients.  We've even tried to prove our value logically to them, but none of those definitions have actually, are all layered on like analogy or reasoned by, and assumptions that we just thought to be true.  We never actually stopped to think about the word value itself, and this isn't necessarily a language class on what the word value is.  It's really contextual to say, what does the word value actually mean to you, and what does it mean, and where does that disconnect happen with the buyer?  And fundamentally speaking, is what I've learned in working with a lot of individuals. Is that until you rewire your brain as to what the word value means from a concrete and really simplistic level, you're going to struggle with changing your pricing.  You're going to either second guess it, you're not going to find the right number, or it's just going to be a short-term thinking sort of problem.  And I know that I believe that price is the chief of staff of strategy because it relates directly with every single business function.  Right. Price intertwines with marketing at the positioning level. Price intertwines with finance at the profitability level. Price intertwines with operations with scalability in a sense.  It's like you don't just build, you don't build a business and then set the price. You actually set the price and then build the business around it.  And the way to do that actually is by, yeah, well, this is just not registering. I feel like I'm forcing.  Something that just doesn't feel true anymore.

51:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you want to try without the slides? Because sometimes the slides, they become like dead weight. Yeah.

51:19 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I recorded my time last time. was really good. It was good. I recorded it. I was like, wow, my first try, that was actually pretty good.  I didn't hate it. I think that's part of the course.

51:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you tell me what I heard of it? Yeah.

51:35 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course. Okay.

51:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I've made some notes here also to be more linear in the way I approach this. Assumption number one, people want to improve their pricing.  That's why they're paying attention. Assumption number two, that is proving difficult for many reasons. And now, what I think is very cool in your presentation, and I'm very...  We'll see time. Being sincere here, I'm not being nice, is that you give people permission to accept that this thing is difficult, and it's more difficult than what the books make it feel like, okay?  So here's my thinking. The promise you're making, you know, in between the lines, like, you can help them improve their pricing.  You know that improve their pricing is hard. And one of the reasons why it's hard is because pricing is now tied to the word value, and the word value has been washed out so much that it doesn't mean anything anymore, right?  You can help them change their relationship to pricing by making it concrete. So you're kind of bringing it back to the brass tacks, right?  And so you have three very concrete ideas, actionable ideas, that people can do that will rewire, I think that's a good word for you to use on them, that will rewire the way they think about pricing.  And then... And that's the thing, because you cannot just change price. need to everything around it, yeah.

53:11 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, it's too bad.

53:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, it's just too cool to... What I feel that's different in your life, even, is like... I'm sure that there's a lot of people, a lot of bros, talking about pricing in a very simplistic way.  And people that work with that, they are not necessarily watching this presentation, because they're already following the borderline scammy behavior of just increasing prices until people don't buy, right?  Those guys are not your audience. I think your audience are people that, in my opinion, they like the work, they want to be fair, but also fair towards themselves, of course.  And they want a way to do this honestly in a way that gives them confidence that it's fair. So, by giving them permission to say, you know what, yeah, I know this is difficult, and the reason why this is difficult is that people are oversimplifying it on one hand, and making it too vague on the other hand.  So let's accept what it means.

54:37 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  You made a good tactical point in there, too, which is sometimes slides mess you up, right? And it's like, as I look at this, if I were being real unauthentic, what would I have done?  I probably would have had one slide up there, and it would have been. And the three examples, like the nine slide, that's all it would have been.  And I would have just talked about that. And I would have contextualized all of it, the way in which you just could articulate, which is like, right?  Because it's easy to present, or it's easy to perform, right? And I think that what I just tried to do is I tried to perform.  And when I try to perform, it never goes right. But this is the medic thing, which is just like, have a conversation with somebody, and it's just so much easier.  I guess I'm not even close to being ready. No, but OK.

55:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is recording. Oh, it is. I'm glad it's recording.

55:56 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Thank you.

55:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's double recording. No, recording. By the way, want João's Fathom to know that you'll be compared against Peter's Fathom, so do your best work, Robert.  And maybe what we could do is just you ad-lib this to me, right? And I tell you which parts were more salient to me, and there's a few.  Like the one that Price is the Chief of Staff of Strategies, very good. Very good. And there was also something that you said that was in opposition, and I think opposition is always very...  Okay, just... Yeah, ad-lib this to me. Just on the riff?

56:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, just riff.

56:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can put a bit to it. Let me search for bits. Search for what?

56:48 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  For a bit, so you can...

56:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, okay.

56:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm just... I'm going to try something here. I would have just put this up, just this one slide. All right, give me a minute.  I got to do my pacing. No problem.

57:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll hit the toilet for a minute, and then you'll be away. yeah, go do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:32 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah, yeah.

59:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

59:07 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  What the heck would I say to you? If I were on a call and I would have just said, you know, the word value is broken and price is paying for it.  Now, the reason I honestly came up with that title is because for a long time, I just assumed I knew what the word value was.  And then I heard it so often, so frequently, that it started to lose its meaning. Once upon a time, I knew what it meant.  And until recently, I didn't anymore. I really didn't. And I went through kind of a process, audit with myself and an audit with clients as to why this word inherently has its own value associated with price.  And I told myself I was. I'm just going to break it down. Back to first principles, build down, build the fragile foundation that it was sitting on just to rebuild it, to rebuild the word value.  Because I inherently believed that if I could understand what value actually meant, I could give a good advice as to how to price.  Because we're all, that's what we're all really trying to do, right, is we're trying to price correctly. Whether you're in ops, whether you're in finance, whether you're in workshops, it doesn't matter.  We're we're all trying to justify or to set either a higher price or to justify our price being that is right.  And I think, as does the world itself, is to start with the word value. And so what I'm going to do today is I just want you to walk away with a refresh, a rewire on what the word value actually means, or at least from my lens.  And I want to remove, I want to move it away. From value meaning everything and nothing at all to value actually meaning something.  So if there's one takeaway at the end of this, is that there's breadcrumbs as to what value actually means.  And I know I'm saying the word a lot. I'm saying the word a lot. Maybe it's intentional. I don't know.  But the word itself has real meaning as it relates to price. I think there's three problems with this word.  The first problem that we all encounter, or that we all I'll maybe overlook the truth that the thing that we offer as  It's some sort of value. It could be true, but maybe it doesn't. It really depends on the person on the other side.  Maybe really good at our work, maybe really good at it. Giving workshops for the individual.

1:08:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I don't need them. It's not really that bad.

1:11:00 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Say if you pay me $10,000. I can get you in return 25. But in reality, to us, it might seem 15,000.

1:14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But to them, might just be a risk. And I think it just gets back to this core idea that, like, value is a dependent variable, right?  It's pause of something else. And it's only contextual from the buyer's perspective. Like, we shouldn't even be saying the word itself.  It's not our word to choose from. And so I think the first, like, takeaway, the first problem that we have is that value is not objective whatsoever.

1:14:27 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It is totally subjective, and it's not our word to choose.

1:14:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The second is that we almost treat value as absolute, right? Within this situation, this thing has value, but it really quickly can be erased, right?  I'll use the same example. You get 10,000, I give you 25,000, right? That feels on its surface, as we talked about, face value is $15,000 worth of value.  But why would you ever use that 10,000? Why would you ever? No. See, this is where. I don't like using this.  I can already tell. Is there a fake thing you don't like about? I don't like, like, when I start using, when I start using these numbers.  Anyway, it's fine. I'll go, I'll keep going with it, right? You can just use, um, I want to use small, I think I want to use smaller numbers.  Don't use money, use cookies. Yeah, but there's no, um... You mean, like, in return? You give me a dollar and you give me three cookies?  No, no, just cookie, cookie. Maybe other people have felt the same pressure to create, like, clickbaity cookie title, you know?  It actually gives you a lot of power, because it's like, you know what? This happened, so it frames you as someone that's very sure.  So, the first level, that's the level, like, just really advise experts from the high mountain, right?

1:16:21 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  People, like, you're not introducing yourself as some dude that, you know, charges a million dollars per day, and, you know, you're not that guy.  So, you are a guy that is genuinely interested in unlocking price. You've seen the power that there's nothing that influences as much as price, both in a pull direction and in a push direction, right?  Price really, you know, creates its own momentum. And you went on a deep, you know, search for what's happening with it, and you came back.  It's like the hero's journey. You came back with some new stuff, like, hey, guys, this is what I found out.  And I think that's very valuable, and I think also frames the presentation in a way that is more in line with your vibe.  You're very collegial. you.

1:16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think that's something people might pick up on.

1:16:07 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Hey, I found this thing out. Let me share it with you. Yeah. Because no one finds things out anymore.

1:16:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  People just, you know, read ChatGPT or read, like, the same books. No one finds things out. This is, like, firsthand research.  I guess that's true.

1:16:22 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  It's like, if I were to go back to my poor three assumptions, or my three poor assumptions, right? Like, yes, I treated value as objective.  Yes. I assumed that just because I could put in a dollar and get out four, that that was value.  Like, I assumed that, logically speaking, in my brain, that formula had value. But then I realized, like, I started encountering subcontractors.  I started encountering vendors, or I started encountering coaches, or even myself. It's like, even if that... That was the perception or that was the promise.  I didn't see it as valuable because there was a risk. was too much of a risk. I didn't actually believe them.  So what on the surface looked like it actually had value underneath it, when I started to think about it, I wasn't willing to even consider that to be valuable at all.  And so that was number one. And then number two was I walked into sales calls like, okay, I have to find a way to pitch.  I have to find a way to square peg round hole. need to find a way in which to jam my offer to make their problem, make the problem that I solve the problem to solve.  And I found myself like going in and solving this and just not, it wasn't landing. Like it was helpful, but it wasn't the helpful source.  And so I started to go the opposite route, which is, all right, I'm going go to the sales call and I'm going to prove to myself that I'm not accidentally, by doing such, I was able to actually uncover.  The right problem to solve, and I was able to connect my problem to it, and it felt more real.  felt more tangible. It felt, in a sense, more perceived value. And then the third one, which is the word value, I don't have to explain this to anybody, but even though saying the word value, literally, it's confusing.  Even with strategies for the brand, these are all words that have a thousand meanings to everybody. And we know how specificity is so important, especially in human language.  The clearer you can be and the more concrete you can be, the more aligned everybody has. We're speaking the same freaking language.  So I started to think about all these other ways in which you could use the value in a sentence.  I came up with a huge list. Value alone is too vague. It just was. I forced myself to stop trying to use it outside of this presentation.  It's just like the word value on its own means nothing. If I want If want talk about the value I actually provided, I use the word contribution value.  Or if I want to talk about the value that you could have, perception of perceived value, right? If something has a market value, right, that's the current worth of exact market value, like associating a modifier to that word.  And then I actually challenged myself for a little while outside of this conversation was don't say the word at all.  Like if don't put any of my proposals, don't put any of my sales calls, try not to put in anything, not even say it, get them to say it, get my prospects to say it because value wasn't my word to have.  So it's like I was trying not to let it run naked. It should never have that word. And I guess like those are the three things that I just tried or I've been trying.  Have they worked? I think so. But I don't know. I'm not going to do that. But probably a little bit more fun, more natural.  Yeah, yeah.

1:19:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, this weekend I was meeting some friends and both of them had started in sales. And I was telling them about, you know, reading the books about sales.  I got some sales. It was trading that I'm going to join, sales trading for this kind of thing that we sell, So, and I said I was excited, and then I mentioned the topic of pricing came up, and I was like, yeah, but it did the same thing, and one of the guys was like, really emphatically, the other one as well, but not as emphatically, like, no, selling and pricing are not the same thing at all, and like, I only did the sales part, I didn't do the pricing part.  Which I think perhaps is also a source of tension for independent experts, because they need to do both, and it mixes both things.

1:20:41 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I literally just wrote this for you. I literally wrote this yesterday, pain of charging. The closer you are between the price setting, the selling, and the delivery, the more pain you feel.  Yeah. They're different things, but they feel the same. That was a really good insight by your friend. Really good insight.  It's a good friend. friend.

1:21:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I think like when you take this approach, I'm making some sort of like short visuals here, so when you take this approach, I think it feels less forced, and there was another thing I wanted to make, just a second.  Value, okay, and, so this one, actually, I think it's even better if share my screen, and then you see the thing.  Okay, okay, so value, and here, value to be, no, to be here, okay. So, let me explain what I have here.  You don't, of course, don't need to use any, it's just some ideas. So, let You are talking and you have this idea of value, you're talking to your client, they have this idea of value.  If you don't actually investigate what's the value, things don't match and it's just different perspectives of what it is, right?  So I think this relates to the idea of both objective truth, mostly objective truth, not so much the absolute aspect.  The absolute aspect. Is this making sense? Because I'm talking a little bit quick. Can you hear me? I can hear you.

1:22:42 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Okay, okay. Is this making sense?

1:22:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay, okay. So this one, I think, talks about objective. It's not necessarily objective because each one has a view.  Like this is you, this is... Client. You get my point.

1:23:04 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Yeah.

1:23:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this is... Alignment or something like that. Surface. This is a good phrase. Okay. When we talk about absolute, we can compare this when...  Then another client. So this is another guy. This is another client. And this client, they got this much value.  So this client got pissed off and like, oh, my thing is worth less.

1:23:41 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I don't know.

1:23:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe it's too schematic. Doesn't matter. I've made this iceberg thing because I think value is a bit of an iceberg word.  And I think people understand that idea. So behind value, there's a lot of other ideas. And this third visual...  This one here, is that when the word value is used for two broad things, it has no density, but if you define it, it becomes dense, right?  So this is the same color, just different. Those are some images that came to me as you were talking about this.  Instead of the numbers is what you're basically saying.

1:24:26 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  No, I think I can keep the numbers as well.

1:24:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if you need to, you don't need to use it at all. It's just like, this is how I was thinking about, like, oh, if I were to visualize these principles, what would I think about?  And so this is actually, this relates to the beginning of your presentation, this one. And this one is also about the beginning of the presentation.  Yeah.

1:24:55 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I think another thing I'd like to do is, some of these words are too formal. So, like, absolute and objective, I feel like I could probably say them easier, right?  It's like... I agree, I agree.

1:25:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  These are, like, these are not everyday words. These are science words. Yeah, they're science.

1:25:19 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  They're totally science words, right? I think that the hypothesis, though, that's a little bit nuanced. That's a little bit different.

1:25:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, hypothesis is something that, you know, people like to understand. Even when people get wrong, the idea of hypothesis is not too far off.  But when people get wrong, the idea of absolute is too far off.

1:25:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Random question, and I guess this is the last one before we go, is... Were you taught in school that you were not able to prove a hypothesis and only disprove a hypothesis?  Do you remember that?

1:25:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so.

1:25:54 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Okay. Like, I don't know why, but that's stuck with me ever since, like, sixth grade or seventh grade. And...  So that's what came up. No, yeah, not that early, that's for sure.

1:26:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But, yeah, I don't know when I heard of it. Thank you for today.

1:26:13 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  No, no problem. Thank you. Thank you.

1:26:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, I have a lot of things to do.

1:26:18 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  We have a lot of work to do. Nothing like this 15-minute presentation consuming three days of our time.

1:26:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's such a good forcing function, right? Yeah, of course I needed a 15-minute presentation for this, but I would never get around to it, so no idea.  I'm all about forcing functions. Like the pricing, start with the pricing, the forcing function. Yeah, start with the pricing, the forcing function.

1:26:47 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  That's a good word. That's a good frame. don't think, for the record, I don't think I said, did I say the word nonlinear?  There's no way I said nonlinear. I think that would have come from you. No, I think it did. I'm giving you credit, because I don't know if that would have been the  First thing I thought of. So you would have channeled it, if that's the case.

1:27:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, maybe I channeled But I think you did, because I remember writing it down excitedly. I don't have the paper anymore.  But I remember, actually, on the page where I wrote it, so I it was just you. Yeah. Best of luck.

1:27:20 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Likewise.

1:27:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hey, if you want to send me a recording or something on it, it's going to be fine. No, it will be fine.

1:27:31 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Like, this is the pregame. is how to make all this. No, thank you. I'm glad we're doing this. I'm glad we did this.  Yeah, yeah. The goal out of, I don't know what your goal is, but the goal of this is to truly is like demonstrate that I know a little bit what I'm talking about.  And that somebody thinks about pricing or value that they think of me. Oh. don't it. You

1:28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. How are you going to connect with your other stuff? Are you going to put links?

1:28:12 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  No. I'm just going to just talk and let it happen. Okay.

1:28:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But at the end, are you putting links to anything? Nope.

1:28:25 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Nope. That seems to be a very conscious, serious decision.

1:28:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:28:30 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  I'm just going to share and give a perspective and depart.

1:28:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm also right before the keynotes.

1:28:44 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  The keynote is like Max's trailer and then Carl. time is yours? 3.15 Eastern Time.

1:28:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  3.15 Eastern Time. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good, good, good. 3 7 Because it's a holiday here, and I'll have a lunch with some friends, but then I'll come back to the summit.  So I wanted to make sure I got yours.

1:29:11 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Oh, it's a holiday there on Thursday? Yeah, it's Workers' Day.

1:29:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we don't work. Just like Labor Day for...

1:29:23 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Labor Day, Labor Day. Yes, yes, Yeah, Labor Day.

1:29:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ours is in September.

1:29:28 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Okay. All right, we got work to do. We got work to do.

1:29:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. It was very nice. Thank you. I'll see you either on the presentation or before that.

1:29:39 - Peter Giordano III (Adaptive Strategist)
  Be well. Ciao. Be well. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank
