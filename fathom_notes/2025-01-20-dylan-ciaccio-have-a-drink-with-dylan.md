0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  meeting is being recorded.

0:04 - Dylan
  Hey man. How are you?

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hola.

0:08 - Dylan
  I'm not ready to speak, man. I'm, I'm, I, you post. Okay. Okay.

0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not bad. Not bad at all.

0:18 - Dylan
  Do you have, do you have a do you speak Portuguese or Brazilian Portuguese? Because you said you, you were born in Portugal.

0:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. So I speak, remix Portuguese now. So both sides make fun of me. Yeah, I've been living in Brazil for 12 years now.  So yeah, at this point, people in Brazil, they can tell right away that I'm Portuguese. Yeah. And people in Portugal are like, there's something weird about the way you speak.  I just get, I'm a pariah now. Nobody takes me seriously.

0:50 - Dylan
  I feel that every time. mean, I don't have a, you know, a British accent, but I, I've been away for six years from the US.  the more I speak other languages, I think the more my brain is like, it doesn't matter how you speak anymore as long as they understand.  So now every time I go back to the US, my family, and my brother thinks I'm faking it, he's like, you don't speak correctly.  No, you have an accent. I'm like, well, what accent do I have? They're like, no, actually you don't have an accent.  You just speak really weird. So now I don't know what to do about it. can't, I don't notice it to me.  It's the same as it always has been, but I get that.

1:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've heard kind of the same thing from native speakers when they went to study abroad and they started, you know, living so much with people that were not native speakers.  exactly. It's like a vampire thing.

1:47 - Dylan
  I become better at English because of you, but you become worse because of your accent. Yes, yeah, that's it.  I mean, I think you have to adapt because, I mean, I hate it when I'm speaking a different language.  which and they just use expressions and speak super fast and it's like all right put a little bit of effort and so I try to do that as well and I try to speak clearly um and I think now it's just uh my default so yeah but yeah I make so many mistakes that people doubt my English ability so does it happen to you when people ask you like do you have this expression and you're not sure because maybe it comes from another language but yeah yeah yes yeah no like sometimes I will like I'll say something in English where it it I mean it's kind of like that but it's basically like I have the expression in my mind in French or Spanish or something and so it makes perfect sense to me and I'm just it it sounds like it I can't see it from the American perspective anymore of how it sounds weird like I don't know a good example but like there's sometimes  I don't have a good example in my mind, but yeah, exactly.

3:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we share a little bit of that, leave the experience. Oh, thank for being up for this.

3:15 - Dylan
  Yeah. Dude, I just get a glass of water, no Bargherita here. I usually try, like it depends on the time of day for me.  If it's during the day, I'm going to have a coffee. I've got a coffee with me. And I don't usually, the Margarita is just a joke to make people feel like, you know, it's a friendly conversation.  know, sometimes I'll have a beer with people, especially because I have American clients and it's at like 8 o'clock here.

3:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm like, yeah, I'll have a beer. Why not? Yeah. It's at the clock somewhere.

3:49 - Dylan
  It's funny that you say that because I actually, I have a watch and I really love the watch. It's a gift from my brother.  But I think I went into the beach, into the ocean with it on.

3:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now it doesn't work.

4:00 - Dylan
  But I have the time set at five o'clock so no one knows that it doesn't work It's just kind of like fashion, but it's five o'clock, and I'm like that's five o'clock somewhere Dude, I just I saw your your profile, and I was like yes I was like finally someone that gets it and I was like it's it's It's so niche because it's it solves a specific problem like you like on your post today You the problem I solve is like how do you make complex expertise easier to explain?  And I think that's just it's a problem that so many people have I Run it. Yeah, no, and it's like I had like I was talking to this another like a positioning expert the other day and I was telling him like Sometimes you get imposter syndrome you're like, oh, maybe I don't know as much as I think I do because I can't do this for myself Yeah, but then you realize like half of it is just  Half of the problem is that you're just human and humans suck at seeing things from other people's perspective Like knowledge if you have that in your sub-stack like we can't unsee information in our mind that changes our perception of things Yeah, so yeah, that was was cool I just feel super I still feel a bit but I used to be much more self-conscious about about that And and do you know because you are you're also working with content?

5:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So maybe this familiar, you know the unignorable challenge from Neil and Katie They're like the hooks clean hooks guys.

5:37 - Dylan
  Okay. Yeah.

5:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah So they're like this challenge course thing last year. I signed up. I never finished anyway I know this never happened to anyone else, but it happened to me and On it they mentioned the Solomon paradox.  I think that was the name. I was not familiar with that Are you familiar with it?

5:57 - Dylan
  It sounds familiar, but I don't I don't think yeah, so

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Apparently, Solomon, like the myth goes, it was a very, very wise king, right? And at some point, there's a famous story of two women that came to him and said, this son is this child is my son, right?  And they couldn't decide. And he said, let's just cut the kid in half. And each one of you gets half.  And so the paradox is like, Solomon was really good at giving advice to other people, but he sucked at, you know, giving good advice to himself.  And when you realize that these things have a name, and you're not just uniquely weird or  up, it's like, Oh, I'm just like, you're normal.

6:36 - Dylan
  Yeah. And yeah.

6:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that was very reassuring. And now I keep talking about, I keep talking about Solomon products to everyone, because maybe they'll have the same feeling I had.

6:47 - Dylan
  Yeah. But I mean, that's like, it's kind of the value of, of these services, like, it's like, yes, you need positioning help.  Yes, you need niche expertise help. But also you just need another human like to, you need a sounding board, you just need someone to see someone see help someone get someone to see it from a different perspective.

7:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah.

7:12 - Dylan
  It's just incredibly incredibly important. Yeah.

7:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's true. yeah, it's totally totally feel like the thing you're saying, maybe I don't know if this happens to you as well.  Because I would imagine to be really strong when there's some relationship to content and the algorithm and stuff like that, which is like, because like 5k followers, which is like cool number, I have three.  And I would imagine that one cannot avoid but comparing like, oh, there's this guy with 500,000. Right. Right. So I would imagine it's good mental gym to to deal with it and just come out come out on the other side, right?

7:58 - Dylan
  Yeah. seeing that the followers thing and I've been because I've been focusing on on this problem I'm solving on LinkedIn and it it's just so much about these numbers and it kind of it's a human thing it's always coming back to being a human thing is that when we're given a number like number of impressions number of followers number of likes like there's so much meaning that is not there so it's like when we're posting like we get 500 impressions for each post there's like we don't actually know if that's our ideal client like we don't know if I don't know I think a lot of my followers are just like virtual assistants from like the Philippines and like they can't they can't buy my service like there's like why you say that because there's a lot of there's a lot of like I get lots of connection requests from virtual assistants India Philippines is like a huge like base of virtual assistants  cool people, I've met a lot of them, but I know that they don't need my service and that was like, that was not my ideal client.  And so, when I look at that 5,000 follower number, I'm like, oh yeah, that's great. But like, below the surface, what's not obvious.  Those numbers are not very good. And so it's like, and I think this is, this is a problem on LinkedIn because people like, I want more followers, I want more impressions, I just need to post more, engage more.  It's like, well, if you saw a specific problem, and there's an ideal customer profile, you don't know if that's really the people that are, that's getting in front of your content.  like, like I was saying in the DMs is like, LinkedIn doesn't have the same kind of discovery feature like Instagram or TikTok where it's interest based.  it shows you niche content on LinkedIn, it doesn't work that way. So if I want to get in front of my ideal customer  profile, having all these virtual assistants from, you know, a different country is not going to get me closer to that because when they engage with my content, it's going to show to their followers.  Their followers is probably a similar demographic.

10:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, numbers, the issue of bursting the bubble is even more relevant, I suppose, right? I don't know if this is a common expression in Brazil, people talk a lot about this.  So Brazil spends a lot of time on social networks, right? Maybe the one country where people do this the most.  And one of the things they talk a lot about, I've noticed, is when something becomes like a niche meme and then at some point becomes mainstream, it just bursts the bubble and flows into like common  discourse, I guess.

11:01 - Dylan
  Right.

11:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what you're telling me makes me think that online is even more besides the boosting the right things and making sure that the good things get the targeted audiences.

11:13 - Dylan
  Yeah.

11:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it's even more relevant to make stuff that actually bursts the bubble of yeah, maybe one needs to be more because if people just agree with you, it doesn't go very far, right?  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

11:31 - Dylan
  Well, I mean, I've been I've been thinking about this for for several years now, and I'm still not, I'm still not 100% clear on everything.  But like, for example, like this summer, I was like, I had a pretty big role. It's a small agency, but I was given equity to really main thing was like post LinkedIn content and get clients from that.  And it was like really good at that. Let's do that. And so on the surface, I was like, Okay, make content about the problem and this has worked really well for 54 for my clients before but then and I was I was constantly posting it doing everything that I thought I needed to do and we got like one client from like one lead and it was not even a good fit and I was just like well this is the problem that they have I feel like the message is on point I've talked to people I think the messaging is right but then I realized like most of my impressions are probably agency founders because that's who agency founders virtual assistants those are who who are my followers and there's just a very high percentage of agency founders and consultants on LinkedIn but I was trying to get in front of like CMOs of tech companies that have above 200 employees and so the content that I like  doesn't matter how good the message is if it does not get to that right audience just doesn't matter and now I think that like I know those people are on LinkedIn but it's it's like when you have a niche message and you have to get to a niche audience there's a lot of problems with LinkedIn Organic that I don't think people realize and I think the main reason is because all these content gurus are saying like it worked for me like it worked for this client yeah five years ago yeah five years ago when there was no one on LinkedIn and then two it's like if like I have a friend that just doesn't believe in like what I'm talking about here and it's like because he targets solopreneurs and it's like dude it's like the percentage of people on LinkedIn like they're like you're gonna get most people feeling your content are gonna be your ideal customer profile but there's other people that just simply can't get in front of that audience yeah there's an audience channel fits kind of thing right yeah yeah exactly and I mean  I haven't completely solved that for myself because like, for example, LinkedIn ads targeting is limited. Like you and I, like we need, we want to find niche consultants.  Like, well, how the hell do you, that's not, that's not a criteria on, on targeting. So it's like, , all right.  Well, it's like, okay, so you, you can like, to some degree get a niche audience, but then there is like a limit to how to criteria.

14:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you know what I'm, what I'm thinking about this now, because I mean, you know much more about, about this than I am.  So I'm not giving you any secret, but just sharing like my, my thoughts on this. So, um, so this year I'll start to, to, to do like this small podcast thing, slice it in, yeah.  And then I was thinking like, who should I invite? And I was at, at, at and people that I've spoken to and so on.  And I started to put it in on, on spreadsheet, no big data, no, you know, just Google sheets. And I was like, oh,  I think I can see like a few different clusters here like there's some people from product management and they are really references in that world there's some people from the boutique agency kind of thing there's there's like this there's some people from the facilitation world and what I've realized that I probably should this is my operating model right now I probably should just do like this bleed skrigs into a bubble like I talked to everybody on the boutique consulting in a very short amount of time put a lot of content and people from that level start to see me and they but not I would like not to miss it too much like go by season so this is the season of x I don't know this is my current hypothesis I haven't I just have the the spreadsheet I spoke to some people like to figure out where to connect it because I'm thinking more about these clusters yeah yeah so like you're inviting the idea of client on or you're just trying  content about running a boutique agency, right? David C Baker, that kind of thing. And I'm thinking, yes, if I just appear around the sphere of this guy, even if these guys are not, if their clients are not looking for workshops or frameworks, eventually, I mean, they will see the connection and start thinking, yeah, yeah, I've seen these names, familiar.  I feel quite a bit self-conscious about telling about this because I seem like I'm telling, I'm teaching this to the, I'm preaching to the choir.

17:33 - Dylan
  mean, you know, this stuff.

17:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But maybe it's useful to you to see how other people think about this and mental models and so on.  So, yeah, my hypothesis is these people are not looking for workshops, and they are already following other guys that they trust on things that are not workshops.

17:54 - Dylan
  Yeah.

17:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But there's a connection between what other guys talk about and perhaps workshops. Yeah, and if you see like the snippet that looks uh I just maybe if I share screen it just becomes a little bit more tangible um the link then uh look smears okay share screen oh you I think you need to authorize me to share my screen I suppose I think I just murdered murdered English for a second there I think uh I think I did it okay my English uh isn't any better at this point man so is this guy okay so this guy is the consulting forum performance advisor and yes uh quite a bit of followers
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/S6xg-EpwDdkZz_riAzN3K9L_xEytit6M?timestamp=1121.417295  from Belgium. anyway, he has this kind of serious vibe to him, let's say. And it talks a lot about signature methodology, you need to have a signature methodology, you need to differentiate your consulting business on the way you work, you need to talk about your method.  He says these like in different ways, but it's kind of his thing. So there's clearly a, they're primed, his audience is primed to be convinced about workshops because he keeps talking about method workshops.  So yeah, so my model, I'm not even very close to this guy, but just sending a couple of messages over time, like over months, like, oh, I like your stuff, thank you for sharing, not more than that.  And yeah, my current theory is that I should just do like this, I don't know, bleed screen into their bubble and be everywhere for a little while.

19:55 - Dylan
  Yeah.

19:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And maybe that the tools spread out. And then eventually try to go into adjacent verbals, right? But yeah, sorry, this was a little bit of a monologue.

20:11 - Dylan
  No, I mean, that's, I think you got the right thing in there, man. So my question is, like, why don't they do workshops right now?

20:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's a very good point. And I think I need more clarity on that. Let me try not to let me organize my thoughts.  believe I need more clarity on this, but I believe that the reason is that either they don't do workshops because they don't know that workshops work.  They don't understand why workshops work. Yeah, or they think or they think. they have like the wrong definition of a workshop which I've seen these a lot which is there's two extremes one extreme is people just do a keynote presentation and call it a workshop to call it something different but it is in the workshop that's a keynote presentation so if that's your first contact with a word workshop you're like yeah workshop is  this is nothing special right and on the other extreme you have like these team building HR activities that they call them workshops but everybody hates them and thinks they're silly and stupid and and now you tell me oh I love those I don't know but these really contaminate how people think about workshops like the definition of a workshop and I think for a lot of people they have this idea of the workshop facilitator that has a funny print shirt and colorful glasses you know and trust the process and everybody can be creative you know I'm really not like that um so  Yeah, I think that's my hypothesis, but I should I should have more clarity on this why they're not using workshop Do you do you use workshop in your work?  By the way?

22:10 - Dylan
  Well? So I want you to defy I want you to define it for me because I think what you were just saying there is is it like I think workshop for me was is kind of like the Because I don't think I've really participated in a workshop before so my understanding that word is limited and so my perspective is that workshop is You like a like a Three-hour session.  You've got a bunch of people there Digital or in person And there's like yeah, there's some content like maybe presentation beginning, but you're working through the concepts With the people Making it, you know more actionable That's what I that's how I see a workshop  as of right now.

23:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's pretty good. think it's pretty good. So basically a workshop is a collaborative, guided experience. So you do things together, but you don't just throw people into a meeting.  So it is guided, and there's a little bit of structure, right? And that experience is to solve one thing, one problem, and sometimes people struggle with this because they don't define exactly what they're solving.  So it just feels like, oh, we need to have more ideas for our next quarter initiatives. This tends to be a little bit too vague, then it's funny.  It feels like a break from regular work, but you're buying credibility on credit, and then you have nothing to show for it, and then people are like, oh, that was a waste of time.  You need to put people together in a place. To work together with structure to solve a specific thing. Yeah, and you need to have something at the end so if you if at the end of that session what you have is a lot of opinions and Just very vague ideas like AI or let's do more is I don't know automation this is This is not useful and that that's where most workshops break is most things break at the Intersection with other things right so if you have a bicycle and you go downhill and it breaks It will break perhaps at the welding point or a specific area where the bike is more fragile to make your own meat So that's where things break and workshops they break at the beginning and they break at the end So you have at the workshop.  You don't know what what you're doing there It's they try to make it too different from regular life, and it's like yeah, just feels like very performative And also at the end which is like oh, this was amazing.  Thank you guys and then you all the outcomes of the workshop, they never make it to monday.com, azana or trello or gyra and it's like so weird ideas and plans and they they don't fit with our daily life so yeah are we going to do this so that's where workshops break but i think you have a very accurate definition if i were to change anything it's just that they don't have to be three hour long but i think a lot of people have the same which is like this long session thing yeah which is good i've talked to you because i'm realizing these might be like a objection point yeah interesting well so i think i'm wondering if what i currently do could be considered workshops because i have like i have basically like my current program the way i've designed it currently there's about four stages in it

26:00 - Dylan
  and to get from stage one to stage four, there's weekly calls. And at the beginning of each call, there's a pretty clear desired specific outcome that needs to be achieved by that call or by the kind of group of calls, maybe like there's a group of four calls because it's not, it can't be done in one call.  How is that different from a workshop or does that meet more of the definition because...

26:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, yeah, I think that's...

26:43 - Dylan
  They're just consulting calls is what I would call it.

26:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. And this is a good conversation for me to have. It depends on how they go, all these calls go, right?  Yeah.

27:00 - Dylan
  Maybe I think there is a little bit of a range between like a call a more actionable thing and yes at work session or something Yeah, and So I do have worksheets that go there that were reviewing on the call So it's like before them I before that the group of calls basically I'll have them fill out To the best of their ability the worksheet I call it the point of view worksheet basically kind of What's the problem you solve?  Who is that person? You know, what is the root cause of all of these pains that they're feeling? It kind of listed out kind of word vomit because you know, they've got you know Oh, there's this problem that problem.  So they're not very clear And so we kind of use that worksheet at the base of the call But sometimes we just kind of have to talk things out on in person.  So that's why the calls exist Yeah, so that's that's kind of it's kind of a the tangible thing doing and we're not just getting too abstract sometimes when we talk and when I call it you can just be theory and But a nice film and not be tangible enough Now this is really interesting to me because I think intuitive intuitively a Yeah, I can see that Not not because of your work just I can see how many people have this question you're you're you're saying like Well, I already do these calls.

28:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They have a structure. We use the worksheets. Is this a workshop? Is this another job? Do I need a workshop?  So I think that's what I but that's what I'm what I'm hearing is a very valid question so And I mean I should have more clarity on this answer as well.  So I'm exploring this with you very valuable to me Thank you. I Think in your context because if we think about like

29:00 - Dylan
  checklist of things. Yeah.

29:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You already pretty far ahead, like you have structure, there's there's a way you work if you transform this way you've worked into a method and you've realized you need some questions, you need to answer some things, and you've created some supporting materials to help you answer these things.  Right. You also are good at navigating this problem space because you realize, oh, this guy's lost. I mean, I cannot just follow the worksheet because this guy's lost.

29:27 - Dylan
  need to go and bring him back to me.

29:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This more tangible thing.

29:34 - Dylan
  Yeah.

29:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if I were to think of from non-workshop to workshop, I think you are, you know, more than halfway through.  And then I'm thinking, okay, so why would you make a workshop then? Right. I think that maybe, yeah, I don't know.  Maybe I'm called new shops. This workshop is a, is a name and just by by people that know about workshops, right?  It's a little bit like you go to the mechanic and they tell you, oh, you need to replace the gizmo, whatever, and you're like, okay, but then it explains it to you, oh, this thing is important because it presents your breaks from exploding, and you're like, okay, okay, yeah, I want to prevent my breaks from exploding, let's do that.  So maybe when I use the language of workshop is a very much subject matter expert kind of expression, and people don't think in those terms, they think about outcomes, right?

30:33 - Dylan
  Yeah.

30:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, yeah, maybe I'm very divided on that.

30:38 - Dylan
  And actually, I have a question for you.

30:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, this is this will cut my monologue. You've mentioned the niche boosting thing, and you explained it to me and it made intuitive, it made intuitive sense.  Okay, yeah, I get it. I can really see that being important. I have never heard that expression. Is this the thing of yours?

31:00 - Dylan
  category you're creating? Yeah, basically, that's, I mean, people have used the word content boosting a few times. I've never seen anyone as their service.  And two, I think there's a problem with just content boosting because if you just talk about content boosting, it's literally just boosting your current content.  And I think there's a big problem with most people's content. So that's why I'm calling it niche content boosting is because the whole point is to get a niche message to a niche audience.  the problem that I'm solving is that most content has an irrelevant general message to a broad audience and in an unsustainable process.  And so to me, the solution to that is niche content boosting. And so honestly, I'm a big fan of category creation, all that stuff, language.  And I've tried languaging in so many terms. different times.

32:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I found myself just kind of creating words just because I thought it was quite his language.

32:05 - Dylan
  Like coming up with a new word, basically. Okay, so yeah, so I can send you a whole article on it.  It's really cool stuff. But I found myself doing it just for like the sake of it. And the whole point is to make it more clear and simple.  And so I've kind of made a rule to myself. It's like, don't create a new word unless you find yourself struggling to explain a complex concept.  And then you just like keep on coming back to just like a couple of words, a group of words to describe that.  So like I kept on, I would talk to, you know, people and get feedback. And I would just keep like in my mind, I'd be like, this is just niche content boosting.  Like that's what it was. for some time, was like, it's, it's, it's consultant marketing. It's, it's content marketing and boosting and positioning.  And it's like, Jesus. And then the other thing is is that I need to own mind share like that's kind of the whole point of each yeah It's like so I could call what I do positioning technically But if I do that I'm lumped into a space where there's already existing people So I want to own my own space.  So that's kind of each content boosting is kind of and I also wanted it to be tangible And like you know like you say because each content boosting is like you kind of already Kind of visualize it.

33:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're boosting it, you know So yeah, I have something that someone else wrote that I think you you appreciate But first let me prime you to like it.  I love this stuff thinking about the words and I use I I sometimes I'm sure you do the same like you have a Some a worth play that comes to mind, you know, like oh, I love this worth play these would have to be used somewhere We need to come up with a problem  I looked for this, but everything starts from the word play, not the need. And so this guy, Liam, Liam Curley, I don't know if you've seen him.  He also does his like content for experts kind of thing. And he has a case study. Yes, case studies on experts, right?  On his blog, not on the LinkedIn. And he talks about how April Dunford became a reference in position, right?  Because she didn't event anything new. So this guy went into the Internet's archive, the Wayback machine. spent like 25 hours to do this thing and was like, what did she do to become a reference on a thing that already existed?  Which is the first thing I printed out this work post and highlighted it. Yeah, it's really good. There's another person I've been very intrigued about how she plays the metagame, which is Teresa Torres.  I don't know if you follow. She's from Product Management. It is. Yeah, and she has this thing called opportunity solution tree, okay This is the thing she keeps talking about and it's amazing how competent she is about talking about this thing from many different angles many different things and She didn't even this thing This thing was it's kind of a common practice in like consulting strategy consulting sort of stuff She just codified it and she she never I don't think she did she was Did anything immoral about it, she'd never set up I invented this thing I don't remember seeing she just talked about it all the time.  She has a book and is interesting like I Think this Categorical creation coining you know expression sort of thing it I suspect I'm very intrigued about that But I suspect it's really about volume and just top of mind up of mind up of mind up of  And because apparently she invented this thing, or she came up with this thing in 2016, she's been talking about it, non stop for that one, which is crazy because I think for people that ever feel comfortable inventing new words, new ideas, new terms, I mean, speaking for myself here, the exciting thing is coming up with the next one, not talking about the old one, right?  Finding some perennial excitement about one idea from a couple of years ago is really beautiful for me. I'll send you the stuff from Liam.

  Have you ever heard of the category pirates?

36:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I've followed them.

36:44 - Dylan
  I think I've followed them on Substack.

36:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not closely, I just signed up.

36:49 - Dylan
  Yeah, I went through an obsession phase with them. I think I've read each of their substacks a few times in their books several times.

36:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

36:57 - Dylan
  The 22 laws of category design is... by far my favorite book of all time and it's it it shows by so much positioning and marketing advice is wrong because it's like it so much so much of it is wrong is because we human like we humans just kind of accept things that logically make sense and they show why you know what might be intuitive is just wrong and it is just it's the greatest book I've ever read man yeah I totally recommend it it's like everything is cat like everything is categories like like categories and subcategories and that's just simply how the mind works and I there's a lot of misconceptions about you know what category creation is you know people on LinkedIn talking badly about it and you know I get that but it's just because they haven't read into all this and they don't understand it and so like I had Christopher

38:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  luck had the author on my own podcast.

38:02 - Dylan
  He's considered like the godfather of category design. And it's just incredible.

38:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're very kind. let me talk about this  for like five minutes and you know all of this.

38:19 - Dylan
  Yeah, exactly right. Well, yeah.

38:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Anyway, just take it as me sharing the excitement of like, oh, this this feels like important magic to know, like, can I put things into people's minds?  This is useful magic to know. Yeah. So yeah, I'm excited about that. Speaking of that, another thing that came up to me, which is I recently bought this book.

38:42 - Dylan
  Second, I think the the I don't have zoom pros. It's about the end. Can I send you a Google me, a Google me link and we can just yeah, send me if you're LinkedIn, LinkedIn.

38:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
