0:30 - Romeu Rodrigues
  aqui na tela do employee portal Eu não estou vendo a total, não sei se está compratendo com mim Não rima mesmo, eu posso compartilhar para ficar mais visual Tá vendo aí?  Sim Tá beleza, eu aqui no employee portal, então assim, esses três... Eu não sei o que fazendo Eu não sei o que eu Como é?

0:55 - A L
  Olá, como você está?

0:58 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Eu só estou falando sobre o que fazendo

1:00 - A L
  last track of time, so my hand's coming.

1:02 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No worries, Ivan said it needs five minutes as well.

1:05 - A L
  OK, that Ivan just joined too, so thank you.

1:08 - Romeu Rodrigues
  OK.

1:09 - A L
  OK.

1:10 - Ivan Ćelić
  Let's go.

1:14 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Don't follow me, please, me.

1:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK.

1:18 - Romeu Rodrigues
  OK.

1:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So good morning, good afternoon.

1:24 - A L
  This is such a global...

1:28 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Let's open this thing.

1:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have a few things that I think were set as done. And... Let's go. So, in overview, create a way to show what the quiz questions are.  This was kind of the briefing. The Project. Share this tab. Okay. So there's a little preview that there are some questions, right?  And if we click here, we are taken to a place with the questions. There's no quizzes in policy.

2:25 - A L
  The quizzes are only in training.

2:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Maybe that's in the wrong. Okay. We can use the same design just for training.

2:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think it's the same, but best to put it in the right place. Yeah.

3:01 - A L
  So go ahead and then for the quiz, my only comment is if it's in that small box, maybe it might be easier because there's not so many small boxes in the training session, but it can easily be missed.  it's like, it like you cannot how do we make sure they don't miss it like they can't save it until they confirm that the quiz questions or what do we or can you put it like some kind of box around this so people notice it more on the side.  That was like my only answer. What happens if they miss it?

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

3:37 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  If you don't get, you will not be able to continue, you like it's like, if you have as a two steps, the first step is to do the training like go through the slides, for instance.  And then you have like a one and then two quiz and you have it like a VV, for instance.  Yeah, I was thinking one like one is from the. employee view, yes.

4:00 - A L
  But from the admin view, they're deploying, looking at the training and looking at the questions, how do we make sure that they see it?  Because right now it's kind of hidden here with everything. If I were using this, I'd probably just go ahead and save it.  I'd even skip over the quiz question because I wouldn't notice it unless it's somewhere near the bottom or something that would be like, why is it linked?  there needs to be like, I have approved review the quiz questions at least like so there's like a reminder that there's a quiz question, but this needs to be in the training section on the policies.  We don't have much time for that right now for the complex stuff.

4:40 - Ivan Ćelić
  Let's keep it simple. Maybe we can design the best way possible, but we have like, we have zero, zero time for anything.  To be honest, if we are releasing on Monday, we don't have time to do much things here. So I will try to do something simple for now.  Let's for now release it without them having to confirm questions and we can Once we approve, we already have a task that you should see a pop-up that says, are you sure you want to approve?  in that pop-up, we can maybe just write, please check the questions or make sure you check the questions along with the content.  And for now, but later I agree it should be like you click approve, you have to maybe even approve the questions separately than the content.  But for now, for this very short time period, let's try to keep it as simple as possible.

5:31 - A L
  Okay, so is there a design task or there's not a design task?

5:36 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think this is good enough for us. Yeah, we don't need just just maybe move it into training. So our copy paste this whole thing and put it in training because it is the same.  It looked the same. It's just not policies for future reference or anything. It's nothing important. We can start without without you doing that, but just for future reference and stuff.  I think it would be good that it's in the right box. Absolutely, yes.

6:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, set it as done, compliance map, highlight policies, communications and training. It looks like this, share this tab. So, we have updated the design and now we have it highlighted for when we're going to launch different things.

6:40 - A L
  Yeah, I think it's really pretty, I think, yeah, Ivan, you said it would take too long to implement this, right?  Yeah, I wouldn't do this right now, yeah.

6:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean, it's fine, the design is fine, but I will just postpone the implementation part for at least not until the release, and then if it's priority after release, then we can do it.  Okay.

7:00 - A L
  If you go to the left picture on the left, just one comment, okay, yeah, so the, I just wonder if like, because risk assessment policies, training, communication, the color is quite similar.  So either like, if there's like a yellow or like some other color, because those are separate sections, right? I do like how you did controls with supplier and other risks because those are actually controls that like under the do they all fit.  Oh, is it because it's all under plan? Is that why it's done with one sub color? Yes. Yeah. Okay.  Let's let's worry about it later. But I think it looks good. I like it. Yeah. I just made a few comments about like, yeah, the lumina, which I think we retire or somehow the little character moon person, because it's kind of doesn't fit in any flow anymore, but that's more of a longer term discussion we could have.  Got it. Yeah.

7:54 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  The one on the right, it's like, can you please go to the right? So these are like the disabled ones.  Yeah, the gray ones are disabled.

8:04 - A L
  So ideally risk assessment would be disabled in this first round. And you would only see the ones that are highlighted.  I think maybe we can like, I think this is cool, but maybe we could wait until we deploy policies, procedures, and trainings, and then do it at control or something, depending on the timing.

8:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

8:23 - A L
  Yeah, one question though.

8:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  I see the bulk size changes depending on the text in the description. Yeah, I should be. So that seems, I don't know, if that's something we want or because if it becomes longer than one bulk, will be really big.  The other will be like smaller fight.

8:43 - A L
  So maybe it's because of the view, that's why it's longer. No, it's also because some has three lines and some has two lines.

8:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

9:01 - Romeu Rodrigues
  So let's set it, I'll mark it here.

9:16 - A L
  And then eventually I think that while we're just taking notes for future, that Lumina character, the moon, I think maybe he can be replaced or she can be replaced with that guy that Romeo had made in the employee portal and the policy, you know, the guy holding the big pencil or something, like, you know, I don't know, a character, there is a character that's floating around our design.  So maybe that character can be used, like replace the character people, I don't know.

9:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, yeah, it's, it's more difficult to create different instances of that character character because it's more complex design, but sure.  but keeping this low priority at least in my opinion this is like after controls and after everything so yeah okay um okay so setting this as done um this thing should be done so they tracked it okay we see your thing only if you want to share something thank you for warning me ahead of time much better new icon new color for policy status uh now we have this shared this tab so maybe on the one on the left uh new icon new new icon new color for policy status  but then that little guy needs to be on top too right is he on top the blue one yeah up there so that those four boxes there should be a blue right that says approved fifth box we need a fifth box we need a fifth box on top yeah do you know what you mean just mm-hmm okay so I'll drag this into progress okay so now we're entering more uncharted territory okay but let's just take these one out of the way first remove yes you toggle from at the top of  And we still see the Figma. Thank you.

12:03 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  So remove ESG Toggle at the top of employee portal home page.

12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  this is probably the easiest thing. Just before we move on to controls, think we can now confirm that everything is ready for release on the design side.

12:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think from what I see and from what I remember from yesterday, we have everything. on that part, think design is more or less good.  And now we need to focus on controls if I'm not constating.

12:27 - A L
  One quick question, we are on this page right here, Ivan kind of texted saying like, I was saying the 15, 4, and 8 that you see here, it's the numbers are not updated.  But you were just saying we take away the 8. Or do we replace it? tell me with what?

12:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

12:46 - A L
  Does the design need to replace that 8?

12:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  Or do we just put a 0 there?

12:49 - A L
  Or do we just leave it blank and have a yellow box? Yeah, I wouldn't have 0 because it will be misleading.

12:55 - Ivan Ćelić
  And to be honest, yeah, I would rather remove it than have it have some little. these two the left two boxes green and pink will have some valid numbers and then this one will be weird but either just remove it until we have something or replace it with some other value we can try to think of something that we can put in there but yeah for now I would just keep the two boxes although I like them.  So does Romeo need to design this with just two boxes then to make it easier. Yeah we'll just widen it and that's fine.

13:31 - A L
  Okay then that's fine then no no design work needed. Okay let's move on. Got it.

13:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this components map is done we've already discussed it. Okay but this is the same task. So this is the same task as before it was today.  different cards but Romeo killed two birds with one stone or two scones with ones I don't know what people say these days so this is the same task okay done okay and now the uncharted territory so for controls so for controls let's let's come into the for context and then we dive into this okay so yes we had a conversation about the whole kind of controls flow right and one of the things that we we've discussed was just to bring every form from every generation with  design every version into the same place and we brought it here for some of them I couldn't find the source yet but I marked them here so we know and this is probably self-explanatory, right?  GOV is about governance, ENV is about environments and we have the source for these things here.

15:18 - A L
  So that's the easy part.

15:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The more complex part is there's the control home page which is already design but one of the things that we needed to address was there's internal and external controls and there's ongoing and annual controls, right?  The way, go ahead.

15:43 - A L
  No, I just confirmed yes.

15:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, now but I heard someone else, I think. No, okay, so because I'm not seeing your faces, so the way we've discussed this was that if we have groups we can have like either the  annual and the ongoing or you can have the internal versus the external one, right? Our idea was to maybe have internal controls and external controls.  And perhaps this means like two different settings, two different controls, menu items here on the side. What do mean by external controls then?

16:24 - A L
  Because external controls wouldn't that go in the supplier section? Third party controls?

16:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So inside the third party, do we manage the list of third parties or do we manage the controls of the third parties?

16:45 - A L
  Yeah and like in my head you would manage the controls of the third party because like as a compliance officer you're kind of like all right this is I'm now working with the internal organization.  Let me look at my internal how to do Okay, third part. You don't look at it as like controls against like the multiple stakeholders, you start at who your target audience that you're trying to do the work with.  to have all of, and then you do all the controls, right? You don't start at like, look, think about the controls and which one does it affect each one.  So that's kind of how I grouped it in the beginning. It's like, these are, you know, these are the ones.  We're now doing the internal stakeholders and now these are all the stuff we're doing deploy them and then you have to get into a whole new mindset for third party because then you need to manage them.  And treat them differently. So that's how I'd originally done it, but I understand your point about they're all kind of controls.  They sit there, but yeah.

17:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because what I'm thinking is there's, so we have the controls which are about data collection, right? And we also have the different audiences for these controls like internal and the externals, right?  So I understand that in the third party management. The one thing that we the key factor to organize it is the names of the names in the types of the third parties, right?

18:15 - A L
  What do mean? I mean, like because almost a third party is almost like if we were to get kind of like a third party is like almost entering a whole new universe and restarting over again.  It's like, okay, I'm going to open the third party door and in there, like I can I need to manage my third party.  So I get to this list of 30 like pretend employees with 30, 30 companies. And in those 30 companies, I need to ideally, you know, eventually deploy a policy, have them redo a training, confirm like this in their own little supplier portal.  And like, you know, have controls that they need to do within their own thing.

18:55 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  So it's almost a mini thing of the thing. Yeah.

19:00 - A L
  So that's like for the suppliers, for instance, right?

19:04 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  Yeah. Yeah, but that means for each supplier, if you have 30 suppliers, you need to make sure that they are following specific policies, specific controls.  So you can... Okay. So it'll be pretty much the same ones, though.

19:18 - A L
  It'll be like you'll be blanket.

19:20 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  It'll be like you have 30 employees and you want all of them to read your code of conduct.

19:23 - A L
  You want all of your suppliers that you've narrowed down to these 30 high-risk suppliers versus your 20,000 suppliers, right?  So those 30 tend to have all the same controls, which is review the policy, review the communication, read the training.  Maybe the other one that's not on here is set up a regular meeting that you have to go in and meet with you.  all of those controls and stuff will be pretty similar, but it's usually managed like... Yeah. And like you think about, okay, here's my supplier hat, and then I need to go in and manage the third party that way.

19:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  Can I suggest a simple solution for now? We removed third party from... this control screen for now and later when we will be working on third party we will add controls there and if necessary then we can just add the third party controls also in the controls section.  As Abby says in her mind it makes more sense to be a part of third party so we can have them there and leave them there and then later we can have a controls also throw third party as a filter or something but for now we can just ignore maybe third party in controls section and add them in the third party section which will be a separate section added later maybe does the best and then also I think we'll be also smarter a bit smarter after we implement and design the controls and then we'll probably have a better idea of where to put the third party controls and and and we want to for sure do them right now right Abby they will come as a part even if we design third party boxes now we'll do them as part of third party management feature right we won't do them as part of controls now we would do it back the controls or third party will come out

21:00 - A L
  third party yes. Yes.

21:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would just to simplify everything let's we know that third party has controls and that they will be similar or same to the controls we have right now but I think we are safe to ignore them until we speak again about third party if you all agree.

21:24 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  I have a question or like maybe why we don't treat them as as you said they're like we open a door for new employees right but then you have like this different type of employees that they need to follow the controls and policies but then from the tool perspective they are I would treat them as part of the company the organization the suppliers yeah the suppliers isn't that the case like if I'm working with a specific supplier  I need them to do the same controls, same policies, they are like a conceptual, they are part of the organization, isn't it?

22:11 - A L
  They aren't, I guess it goes into like kind of semantics, but like in general third parties are a third party.  You shouldn't be treating them exactly like your employees because employees are your first line in that you work with.  a lot of this policy like demanding and policy sign off in employees, you can make it mandatory or fire them.  can be like, you don't sign off, I'm firing you. Suppliers, in general, you can't really do that. It's more like, please, can you sign off on this policy?  If you don't, then we need to like have a conversation and follow up with you. So it's a little bit like, you know, unless you're like Microsoft, then you can be like, I'll screw you, I don't want you.  But even Microsoft can't do that because they have certain suppliers like crayon that like they have to work with them, even if there's like because they're your only ones.  suppliers are a little bit like, yes, you should go through

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the same motions but you don't have the same consequences like if you're not as like you know if it's not if it's not followed through because they're they're not your employees so okay then I need to look at the proposals on the job on this I think I think for now the suggestion of even is good we can just decouple the third party and the and the rest of things so we just focus on controls for internals I think that would work so in that case let me get back to the to the stigma so in that case what we need is all the controls will be internal for this first stage right there's three environmental controls I mean all the controls are internal it both the government and the environmental correct okay so for  That's it. Okay. So the way that people arrive at these controls and they fill them up Is via the employee portal, right because they are here Yeah, yeah, okay.

24:14 - A L
  Yeah for some of them, right the ones that are deployed to all Right, but then there are there are some and this is what we need to decide.  I think it's like Yeah, how did we say we're going to do that for some of them that are like Absolutely like this is like reporting or like carbon carbon accounting office That's not going to be for every employee But like, you know, some of them like, oh, who is it?  Like, yeah, I was at a customer today and he like, you know employee volunteering could be one like, you know Eventually on the side where people can log in their employee volunteering or there's like some other One I can't remember like the eye or something like grabbing like different.  I don't know Like so there could be eventually things that you would like submit In here, but there are some that are just like, I only need Mustafa to do this because he's the office manager in this  thing and I like so it's not going to go to all employees so they're like and that's definitely on the environmental side you'll see more of those.

25:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's a task right?

25:09 - A L
  Yeah, then that would be I guess a task that would be sent to their employee portal but I think we're not doing that right Ivan are we are we sending an email or something because we said it was hard to send it sorry what do you mean because we can so we can send an email once you deploy to someone I think it does already send an email with the link whatever was deployed at least that's how it for how it works for we just had that conversation on carbon reporting right on the cloud and I was like can you dominate somebody within the tool and then you know to do it and then they get like in the tool they get a notification and then we're like no that's too difficult we need to send an email for this first round yeah yeah yeah it's best it's best to send an email but we can create a task from it that's not a problem so maybe we must misunderstood each other but ask we can have a task for that

26:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  That shouldn't be a big problem. We can send an email for that task, but notification as a whole, I would avoid doing it right now.

26:09 - A L
  That's what you ask.

26:11 - Ivan Ćelić
  But in the long-term, we need the notification. I think it would be good to that they can resolve notification and resolve tasks and so on.  for now, let's keep emails as, because emails are actually almost zero work for us. We have it already. We just need to define template and send some data to it.  So for now, it's easy, and the notifications will require much more work at this point.

26:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think we've discussed three different mechanics, right? Sending an email, adding a task to that person's task list, and sending a notification, right?  In the future, all of these things are integrated, but for now, they don't.

26:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can have two out of three for now, send an email and create a task for that employee. Which could appear here, for instance.

26:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:57 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. This is great.

27:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the forms that appear here are the forms that are available to all. And the forms that appear here are the ones that are available only to specific people, specific audiences, right?  Yes. Okay, and perfect, perfect. So going back to controls as a compliance officer. So let's role play this. I open up control, just internals.  We don't even call it internals, just controls, but we know it's just for employees, right? And let's say that I've noticed that there's something that's missing, right?  On the annual, there's something that we'll need to collect this from other people, right? Does this make sense?

27:55 - A L
  I don't see your face. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, repeat that.

28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have the flow of the person that receives an email and goes and fills the form, right? Or the person that logs into the employee portal and clicks on that form and just does it, right?  have this. This is good. My question, but maybe this is for now. My question is how do we support people who fill in a control that is, you know, about to expire?

28:29 - A L
  So for the annual controls, usually what that is is like everybody has to do it or like the people designated have to do it and you'll chase them until the death of it.  For the ongoing ones, it's like it's like it's voluntary. There is no chasing. It's like more you send out regular communication and then if they want to or you make a communication thing like if you say, okay, nobody's submitting anything, then you write you send out a communication that says please submit and then get people to do it.  But that's more voluntary.

28:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then like the annual ones are usually you're chasing until they finish it.

29:00 - A L
  did make a good point it's like let's say somebody does do a conflict of interest right in employee portal where in our launch of controls are we going to see that task come in so do we need to create that dashboard page which we hadn't created yet was where the incoming requests come in like no no we can use the just the task list yeah but where is the task list here the test isn't it on the admin view of things yeah I think I think this is one thing that we didn't yet get to as how some controls need to be approved some submissions for controls need to be approved or rejected that's what she's referring to so if we can like just create this task requiring actions or task reporting requiring but let's let's just one step at a time I would just to answer your questions how how we chase someone so what Abby mentioned I think that's that's also a good point but that's something else but what

30:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think is how to chase someone who needs to fill in like annual or something so we deploy a control which is not continuous so not ongoing control but the other controls and then we set some kind of deploy date I don't know first of January or whatever and we can have an automatic script or something that can set days or three days before it said another email as a reminder if you haven't completed the task we can resolve it like that or we can have admin through interface also have send a reminder action both I think are valid I think for the two ongoing ones like the two ongoing ones where you need to have a completion then it has to be the same flow as like a training completion so you know you have the deployment you know you have the thing and you can see what it and then you can chase that it will look very similar to those two for those for the annual you need to set a reminder yeah like like there'll be specific people like you know wait you maintain you all not ongoing you maintain you all the annual yeah okay okay yeah sorry yeah yeah all good so yeah  I'm not sure if you're still following but basically for the controls which are deployed specifically like once a year and you expect them to be completed in a certain period of time we can have similar things and redoing policies to any communication where you can have a table and then you can see who did not fill it in and then you can send reminders through that UI.

31:25 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  We can use the similar flow as there.

31:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  So isn't it a little bit like this? Yeah yeah yeah that something like that. I think it comes in line with what you suggested there.  It's just not companies here but you mentioned.

31:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because this is something you guys already have coded right? No. This is a screenshot from the app.

31:52 - A L
  Yeah this is from your supplier portal the supplier. This is third party yeah this is not controlled. Yeah and third party you have.

32:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  the top you can see the top compliance map slash third party manner.

32:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have it as a structure.

32:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's not a problem to do, but it's not already done for controls. Correct. Yes.

32:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's not pulled at a high level.

32:13 - A L
  It's pulled per company.

32:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The way this is set up, the two do's, right?

32:17 - A L
  yeah. Yes. Yes.

32:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think, I think the main point here is that I assume that tables are a component that is very easy to custom.  Yeah, that's instead of like custom design, we, you know, look like this, like, like, you know, that dashboard page for the admin couldn't just look like an employee portal form, you know, it can look like this, right?

32:42 - A L
  These are your tasks. And then these are my forms, like these are the ones that came in for now before we have dashboards, right?  So can't just kind of do a replication of this for the admin portal? If you go, I'll go to admin portal and then go to the dashboard part.  Oh, it's maybe just I mean, disabled. but yeah, there's this one. here.

33:04 - Ivan Ćelić
  Oh, yeah, you found like, so can't we just redesign it?

33:08 - A L
  Like, because really, we only need these two, the two on the right right now. But then that's also the same thing in the employee portal.  So to make it easy, can we just replicate the employee portal here?

33:18 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  You have it similar, right? Like on the right side, you have the tasks and then the incoming requests should be saying that task required Yeah, it is the same.

33:27 - A L
  This is the old design. And at the same time, we don't have any dashboards, which will be very important to ideally like, you would ideally you would have dashboards on like training completion and that but that can be maybe in the next version for controls.  But there needs to be some kind of in the meanwhile, there needs to be some kind of dashboard or like, you know, admin page where they can see their overall tasks and like incoming requests.  Does that make sense? I'm like, what would be the easiest to get the right side of that? Yeah, pretty much.

34:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  I mean, it still requires some work to translate it to admin portal to have some stuff there, but, but yeah, definitely from the UI perspective, it is just to replicate.  We can have a minor changes there just to differentiate it a bit, but yeah, if we could keep it similar, that would be easier to implement for the first time.  Yeah, don't know how do you think or like, yeah, delete it to that point.

34:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We just duplicate the employee portal.

34:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine with that, but if you have some suggestions to maybe differentiate a bit or some small improvements that we can do also fine with me.  yeah, because we'll also revamp it. know that we'll also, there's words will come in graphs will come in. So just keep in mind, maybe not best idea to spend too much time both designed.  I think that will waste time.

34:52 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  I agree.

34:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I would just duplicate the employee, the employee portal, maybe just, you know, I don't know if this is easy or something but yeah never mind just duplicate it and yeah that's it yeah yeah yeah so yeah like if it if it yeah maybe duplicate it maybe yeah maybe make it slightly different because I can imagine someone getting lost which one's the employee portal which one's the thing and like yeah it might be confusing so just maybe slightly change it or have a different picture then that could be no maybe for sure they will be confused if they are if it is the same but my assumption is if I am the admin the compliance officer I only log in into the admin view right and then inside of that admin view I can do things as an employee right yeah it's kind of like right now right you don't have it no no no no right now it's separate you have you you can do employee stuff through employee portal and admin stuff through admin portal I think sprint is the same way that was because that's the simplest right now to implement we can have what usual are are suggested

36:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  what you are suggesting, but I'm not sure that brings some questions, know, we have to divide what are the employee stuff like technology policy, deploy policy and all that stuff for now.  It's much easier for us to just give two roles to the single user, your admin, your employee, and then you can do whatever employees can do and you can do pass admin stuff for now.  agree. So if you could just have some visual small difference right now that would be easiest and the quickest for all sites.

36:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would just do like dark mode for admin kind of thing. whatever works.

36:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  I'm fine with whatever, yeah.

36:35 - A L
  Okay, so we'll put that as a task for Romeo because we won't need that for controls because then we're going to have to, they're going to have to follow up on the controls.  So once we deploy the next one. yeah, shall you create a get to, I guess? I'll

37:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This dark mode, unless it's automatic, takes a little while to design for all the combinations. So we've just been to make sure we don't lose some of the clarity we achieved so far.

37:32 - A L
  Decisions. So I'm going to list the decisions I captured.

37:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We will start with the controls just for employees. We will have the forms just for the employees once. Where are these?  These forms? These forms will be accessible via the... We are seeing Judah.

37:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  Thank you. Let's go back.

37:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So first decision, we will keep... The home for controls only focused on internal controls or controls for employees not even stress too much about that for now and The forms themselves the controls themselves They will be Accessible via the employee portal Here right and we know that in the future we might need to filter out these things, but for now just put them here and and Also solved conceptually how to do how to deal with the specialist tasks Let's say it guy gets a task here.  It doesn't get like a specific button here, right? We didn't solve that on the design, but kind of did is just a task here, but Conceptually that's the thing and There's we are not solving now for this version the issue of chasing people around for Asking them we can check the status  of things we can check that control has been done or has not been done but we don't have an option of just sending an email to that person right we just have this thing this sort of thing is hard to send an email reminder or like to get that like or like to send a no but i'm afraid we won't have enough time to do it that's my concern most of these things are not hard it's just a lot of them right so uh yeah i'm gonna do the email now i think we're already being helpful by concentrating information in a single place and that's already a step function from what they have i would not do that that now okay yeah you mean sending email from the admin page yeah yeah yeah exactly but they could send a reminder from the admin page like and that's email or no kind of like we have the reminders on the policies or the trainings you know like if they don't complete it you can send a reminder right

40:06 - A L
  I think it's just a matter of there's very little time to develop, yeah, it is but it's another thing it's we have to we have we can replicate you but we have to it will take someone like half a day or a little bit more to do it then we have like 10 days available it's not like we have a lot of time to do it but we can add it to the list and if we have time we can do it but there's a lot of lots of things along with the release next week yeah we'll have some things to work on with the release next week that's also yeah because I guess after this even you're gonna like kind of try to break down and maybe you can work with Mustafa and I break down like how much each of these tasks will we need for controls to get done is that yeah okay it could be good to get that because we should have that ready for this week to see maybe we could do it tomorrow but do we have all the drawings then for  Controls, no, right? No, we are not done with controls, not close to that, I would say. There's stuff that you guys could start with is my point, right?  Yeah, we have things to do.

41:12 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's fine. As I said, on Monday we can start with the controls homepage and the forms and so on.  I think we still haven't covered the approval rejection part of the controls flow. yes. Do we need to draw that or is that already drawn the approval?

41:29 - A L
  I mean, we implemented it, but I'm not sure that doesn't fit this new design at all.

41:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I would say we need to design it and I think Rao needs to be aware of it. I'm not sure if he, if you draw, are aware of that flow.  So once, for example, once I fill in the gifts and hospitality as an employee, then someone needs to approve it or reject it, basically.  So yeah. And that we have a couple of pages done for that. I'm not sure how you can access it.  Try to write. Go to policies and just replace it with controls at the top. I can send you the link if want.  How you can access controls. I'll send you the link again. I've managed a minute. OK, cool. So here, Hacker Man, the gift.  Yeah. So this is the overview of the form. The idea behind this page was that you can just see the form and review it.  Go to one that's not deployed, please. Go to the one that's not deployed. Not started, for example. Here, you have to approve the form.  You approve this. We cannot edit it now, but in the future, the idea was to be able to edit the form, the question, blah, blah, blah.  For now, you click approve. Question.

42:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This format looking at would be, for instance, filled in by somebody like John Doe, answer this thing and answer this thing and answer this thing.  And then I approve these answers. No, no, no, no, no.

42:54 - A L
  This is read-only form.

42:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  Just to see the questions.

42:56 - A L
  Yeah, this is deploying the first step, a compliance officer. do you have to look at the form that we provided them and confirm this is the form they want to deploy to the employee portal.  So this is just a deploy it to the employee portal and then there's a whole other step once they actually submit something.  Yes and then yeah sorry.

43:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I understand that but my point is let's say I fill in a form as an employee. Yeah. I don't do it well enough so you cannot as a compliance officer you cannot say that I did my job right my task is still pending.  Yeah yeah.

43:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah you know yes but you can you can see the flow if you go I think it still requests top right corner here on most recent submissions you can see click there yeah and here you can see one submission open it can you click view at the right to click view and there you can see basically the flow okay this is a little bit buggy UI because we didn't polish it up we just implemented it and we stopped there we never tested it or anything but the idea is here that some don't know a user  fill in the conflict of interest early form and then here you as a line manager come in and then you see the responses which for some reason are not loading right now but ignore that because I said it's a bit buggy.  So here you see and then you read my responses and then you say oh okay yeah you can even write some comments there and then you say oh okay it makes sense okay and you click accept that's the first line manager then the second compliance officer has to come in and then he also has to do the same thing it won't work don't worry this is not how it's supposed to work with this feeling and this should be already filled in it's a bug as I said we didn't test it too much okay right now but but the whole point of this flow is that you need two approvals to be okay with with this control and that's that's for this control that are submitted to employee but that are ongoing like gifts and hospitality some  expenses and all that stuff. So this is the phone that we'll need to translate to the new design also.  Mm-hmm. You're just making a note of that?

45:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Okay. Two approvers. Add approve return. Yes.

45:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  this side, like, one more thing, Serge. Yeah. Just so we can write it down. So the first approver is selected when you are deployed.  We ask you, please tell us who needs to approve this. That's the line manager because the line manager can be, if we don't have the right hierarchy in our system, we don't know who is line manager.  So for now, we only, we let you enter the email or select the user. don't remember of the person who needs to be your line manager.  Then that's the first view and the second view is automatically the admin in our application. Yeah, that's it. Sorry about that.

45:59 - Mustafa Mahamid Adam
  Thank you for this. I think you answered my question, what I had in mind. Ah, okay, good, yeah, perfect.

46:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect, so I saved this. Okay, so this step, create home for controls version external. This was a simple task, but let's just set us done.  But, see, have, separate, external, services. Done.

46:50 - Ivan Ćelić
  Done.

46:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is done, the home for controls is what we've been kind discussing here. This thing, where is it?  This thing. So this is done, we just needed the new status here, right? Yeah, okay.

47:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  But do we need it also for controls?

47:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would say yes. So the change that we will apply the new status for policy transfer is for controls.

47:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay. Yeah, like the new, like the five. yeah, yeah.

47:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. This here.

47:44 - A L
  Okay, just to check on priorities.

47:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is, uh, anything blocking you, Romeo? Okay so nothing is working from you. Do we keep the priorities that we have so far?  I don't know if everyone can see me.

48:16 - Ivan Ćelić
  Go ahead. So yeah what's missing on controls then? Carbon reporting, flow for approval form, yeah that's the one that we just went through.  You created a task for real good. And what third one? Create different version for, okay yeah that's what's that?  Ah that's the one, I see that's the home page or yeah. Just make it different. Yeah no problem. Okay so yeah I think I think we are missing a couple of those things to have complete controls load.  We can start with something of course but we cannot have a complete picture yet until we see the probably reject pages, but this other stuff looks good to me.  So we have controls on page. So we know how the controls will look like, but what we are missing, yeah, one more thing I think.  So what I think the current design is missing is that page when you have to deploy a control. I think that also needs to be updated to the newest design.  If there's the page you opened, if you go back to the app, let me just throw you, go back to controls in the app, not the Figma.  So this one, yeah. No, no, no, sorry, wrong one. Sorry, go back to the control homepage if you can just through the URL directly.  Yeah, and now try to all click on view button below any, you can click on anyone. Yeah, this is what we need.  So this whole page, I think it doesn't look good right now. And I think it would benefit from maybe a small make up update.  We don't have to do much. shown in the form as we agreed we will not touch forms too much but maybe we can update the header or colors to match the other stuff just like that.  We don't have to do much work here. This is a read-only page where read-only survey where you just have to click approve and deploy buttons but maybe it will help that it's a bit more styled I guess it looks a bit off right now to be honest.  Even a question I know won't come to this round but if we eventually needed to have that edit function on the surveys like how how long would it take or not because I can imagine that it's going to be a little bit of a pushback on some of these like I don't want to collect this information about expenses or yeah it depends depends on how complex do we want to so this library we're using gives us out of the box survey builders so I would say it's probably a week or two just from the top of my head to have it to make it work maybe a week even even like that because of the library we're using it shouldn't be much work it's now a question how the UI will look like you know because  The whole server builder thing is, it can be as complex as we want or as simple as we want.  in theory, think a week or two would be the time that it will take us to do it on here, something like that.

51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also, if I understood correctly, because of the form library that we are using, there's a lot of flexibility, and it's relatively easy to technically allow the admin user to create their own forms, correct?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  We are storing forms as adjacents in the backend, and that's like using that library, and they have their own server builder, which we can just integrate and configure, of course.  And that's the reason why I'm a little bit reluctant to change the style of the service right now, but we can also have flexibility there, we just don't have time to do it.  It does the thing. We can customize all the elements in the service just that we don't have time. That's the reason.

51:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can even share again with you.

52:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  the library, so you can also check it out and see how it works. It's cool stuff, yeah.

52:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I remember you showed me, it was just very cool, got me intrigued. The point about the experience, I think when we give people the opportunity to create their own forums, people have people's competency with creating forums is on the curve.  A lot of people are really bad at creating forums, so they will feel that the power is bad if they don't do a good job of creating the forums.

52:33 - A L
  That's a good point, and I think that I can also use that as a selling, like if they go like, I want to edit my own thing, then I can be like, well, you need to commit to paying and, you know, I can use that as a way to convert that from being like, okay, we'll put it in for you.  Yeah, like, okay, you want to do the form builder, we'll make sure you confirm your pay and we'll do it and that's a good way to convert them, so it's fine.  Mm-hmm. I understood.

53:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, so just to show this is form builder, we can have something like this embedded into our app, and it's like really can drag and drop, add questions, change them.  It's had really lots of options. even has conditions of this question if the answer on the previous one was yes, blah, blah, blah.  It's really advanced, and we can even configure what's visible. So for some users, it can be really simple with a couple of options.  Just so know. A couple of options, right? Now I was one of the investors was saying, they like to see tools that have upsell options.

53:28 - A L
  So it can be like you get the free basic one will change. If you want to form builder, then you need to pay X money.  I agree.

53:34 - Ivan Ćelić
  I agree that that could be a selling point for higher price and features. Yeah. Yeah.

53:41 - A L
  Sorry, job, please continue.

53:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  No problem. I'll it quickly. No problem.

53:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for now, the development team as is not stuck on design, the design team as clear tasks to work on.  And we have now kind of a simplified flow for the control. which is something that we are more confident that we can do in the available time.  Yes. A quick question.

54:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Why is this task in top of progress? I think it's done, right? Which one? Top task in the in-progress column.  The one in green?

54:18 - A L
  Because we need to add a box.

54:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, the box.

54:21 - A L
  Okay, okay.

54:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, sorry. I forgot. Yeah, my bad.

54:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  My bad.

54:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so then that's good.

54:34 - A L
  And then so maybe Ivan and Mustafa, I don't know if you guys have time tomorrow to go in and kind of break down what it would take for controls and the resourcing needed given all of these.  I guess it's little bit of a right because you also need to see some of the pictures before.

54:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  Or we can do some things, but there will still be a couple of but we can do as we can write on what we have right now.  I will create tasks and I'll try to also I'll think more now for the back and stuff. He's more in it, maybe best, but yeah, Mustafa, maybe you and I can go over everything and try to estimate what we have.  then when the design comes, we can just add to the estimations. Yeah, sure.

55:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the design that we're talking about for this phase is basically the design of the forms, like style, make it better.  Yes. And the proof flow, right? And the employee.

55:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  And carbon reporting, maybe once. And all the e-controls.

55:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I guess all the e-controls that we need.

55:29 - A L
  Yeah, but that's it.

55:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's the layout of the forms, like you mentioned, plus the carbon reporting, which will be a little bit cost, and basically top three tasks in your to-do list, mostly.  So yeah, even the second one is not a problem, but basically approval flow and carbon reporting. that's it, think.

55:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Abby, regarding this carbon reporting for offices, do you have a reference document? Yeah, I thought I sent it.

56:01 - A L
  Did I not send it?

56:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe, I'm not sure if I have it. I have it here.

56:08 - A L
  just put it into the chat. Brighton was trying to design it on a Figma and not a Figma on Canva to try to make it prettier, but we at least have the text ready so we can use that customer-attached information.  I need to find it. I'll ask her to add it onto the channel, but she's created it, so we have it.  She also has the Ethics Survey also ready. It's part of the controls. Here it is. Let me see if I can put it into the Design Channel.  So, you have it. I just put it in the Design Channel if you see it. I think you need to give me access.  Okay, I think Brighton probably needs to give you access because it's the doc hard document. Can you download it and send it via email?

57:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can do that.

57:23 - A L
  Let me find it. Okay, I'll send that to you. Okay, anything else?

57:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, then I think we're good.

57:43 - A L
  we talk tomorrow and see what there is. Yeah, tomorrow I won't join. No, you won't. Yeah, that's right. So I guess we talk on Monday then or like I don't Romeo could just

58:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Like I guess when there is comments to be made there you can remain you can write in design channel once we have if you have questions And maybe you can just show what you have and then we'll we'll write in Like I actually realized I can't make it because I have to do a pitch.  Yeah, let's cancel it Yeah, and then I don't know we need Friday.

58:19 - A L
  What do you think or yeah?

58:21 - Ivan Ćelić
  I I say let's cancel design design sink and you know That will let's have our things That stuff yeah Because happy we have a tomorrow morning we have a meeting to walk through the app Not everything is ready.  So we'll also have to do another one. would say on Friday sometime So let's let's also schedule that when you have time.  Okay.

58:45 - A L
  Yeah, it sounds good Okay, I think I'm a pun. I'll send it in now. I'll put into the design channel when it's ready.  I'm just downloading it now Okay, all right, thanks guys
