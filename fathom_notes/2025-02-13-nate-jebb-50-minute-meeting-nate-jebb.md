0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nate, how are you? What's going on, man?

0:07 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Good, good.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a little bit too hot here for the suit, but looking sharp as always. Thank you.

0:16 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's been a while, it's been a while.

0:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it Christmas. Oh my goodness.

0:23 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, first of all, can you hear me okay? I can, I can. Oh, man. mean, it's been a... Well, okay, without answering the question, let just tell you a story, okay?  Okay. So... I started working at Playbook Builder as a sales guy.

0:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

0:54 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And I was doing well selling, but then no one was staying on the system. I'll turn it I think right So I called them on said why are you churning?  You know why why'd you leave and they said well because it was too much work to put stuff into your software in the map our processes So I said well, I'll do it for you for free because I just wanted to get the sales commission, you know Like I had to keep them as a client So in the course of two years I worked for 314 companies getting them into Our software Mm-hmm, but what I realized was they wanted me to map their processes like what we do at step a and then step b and then step c That's not what happens at companies.  What they what happens is they're like well Steve knows how to do everything and see They don't have a process.  They've got Steve Yeah So I went to my buddy at Proctor and Gamble He was he's retired, but he ran operations at a pretty high level for them in strategy and  I said, I don't get it. What am I doing? I'm doing this and it's working, but it's not processed.  And he said, it's called management. And so then I read all these books about management, and we talked about this, you know.  And through Dave Gray group, I actually met this guy, Saedo. You know Andre?

2:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, We were in the Latin America cohort group meeting. Yeah, he's Brazilian, right. He's Brazilian.

2:27 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And maybe I got to go to Brazil and see you and Andre. But he started teaching me about knowledge management, and so I'm like, wow, okay.  That makes sense. then the big one that made sense was I got this client where the guy was retiring, and he'd been there 47 years, and they're like, what are we going to do when he leaves?  So anyway, I keep telling the founder of Playbookville there, I'm like, John, I think we're doing the wrong thing.  Like we're not processed. We're knowledge management. And additionally, it's not like, we shouldn't even put them in Playbook, but we should put them in like, one of the video recording calls we've got, Fathom, and then make it searchable.  So anything that they've said to us, you could just ask Fathom a question and it'll bring up their answer.  I mean, it's unbelievable. And so, but you know, he didn't want to do that because that would involve redoing the whole software and all this stuff.  So basically, there's a lot more detail to this, but at the end of like, December, we parted ways. So I'm not at Playbook with it.  And so then I'm thinking, man, I going to like, should I get another job or what am I going to do?  And something hit me. was like, I'm doing this, like, they know what will work. I've been saying what will work.  I could go do it. Like, what's stopping me from doing it? And so I just started calling the people at Playbook Builder that I was  For free doing this for to keep them as clients and I was like, I can't help you anymore And we said well, well, we'll hide you to do it.  I'm like why not even that playbook brother Derek? We'll build out our playbooks, you know and in John of course likes that because it's Keeping his clients, but they're just paying me so in 25 days, man I sold fifty one thousand four hundred dollars of of engagements I mean it was like my I blew up in my mind.  I blew up Oh I was like, oh my gosh, because that's unreal. I mean that means I'm over the target on something, you know Something that people want and so So I'm in the middle of that right now and almost when I'm talking to Is either referring me to someone or saying like I literally tell them what I do I'm not even with selling them and they're like I need to work with you and This is all  I tell them, this is literally all I'm saying. go, it's kind of like what I just said to you.  I'm like, well, you know how Steve is at your department, Steve knows how to do everything.

5:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  know, like, yeah, Steve, he's the best.

5:12 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, what if other people could do what Steve could do? You like, yeah, that's great. I'm like, yeah, that's what I do.  I go, okay, how do you do it? I'm like, well, I come in as a student and I learn everything Steve does.  And then I become a teacher and I teach the other people what Steve does. And they're like, you're hired.  I mean, it's really crazy, the sales. that's what's going on, man. I mean, it's like probably the most exciting like business month of my life.  Like it's unreal. So that's what happened.

5:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm so happy.

5:43 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, yeah, so happy to hear that.

5:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. Oh, is the mug exactly the one you the one you dropped? Yeah, this is new, but- The man is on brand.  Yeah.

5:55 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And here's the mug.

5:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Amazing. Amazing. it's it's it's really good to hear that and on so many levels like the excitement and you you know following the things and the signs that you've been seeing but also clearly this was not some spur of the moment thing so this has been marinating in your mind for a while yeah for years yeah so um very cool very cool and it's very good to root for you because you're a nice guy so yeah it's also it makes it even easier because it's it's working so yeah well thank you but let me tell you there's a huge irony I don't know how to teach other people what I'm doing that's exactly what I need what I've got and in a way I feel like that's kind of what you do you know you could help me package this up  Yeah, I, I, can, um, yes, I think that's, I've been noticing that's the pattern that when people say they like something about my work is usually something around that.  So I like doing that and I feel I'm, I'm competent at doing that. And I've been studying a little bit more about what's the actual name for this.  And maybe it's silly, I should have asked you, but apparently like in the literature, academic literature, they call it this expertise elicitation and they have like methods for it.  But I think like it's difficult to do it on your own, right? You have the tools, it's just difficult to do it on your own.  You can't do it to yourself.

7:44 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  You can't read the label from inside the bottle. Exactly, exactly.

7:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's, uh, it's, it's an honor that that that I might be able to help you with this. So great.  Okay, I, I, I get it. And in a way, it feels to me that you know you have the innate way of doing things.  I just wish you had more like handles to talk about it and put it in front of people.

8:15 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, and I want to say one other thing. We should talk about if you want to take projects from me.  It's exactly in what you're doing, but what I just did in January is crazy. That makes no sense for sales.  I think there's a huge pent up demand in the market for this. And if there is, I'm going to need people who I'd rather just go sell it and get you work and get other people work now.  I don't know if it's exactly what you want to do. So let's talk through it, but I'm just, I want to throw that out there.  No, sure. I mean, let's talk about it.

8:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I would like to. again by by retributing like all that you've given me. this is why I'm trying to keep stay all business and stuff because I feel that I must do that and I wanted it.  So okay so you have this new business that you started it with like almost a full Rodex. People know you people trust you people refer you and you've done this thing before so it's not really a matter of feeling confident about it to just know how to do it.  Why do you want to know how to teach it?

9:42 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Two reasons. I want to be able to explain in a one-page infographic to my clients the process. And then I also I don't have a desire really to  scale this. That's just not how I'm wired. But what I would like to do is be very best at this work that Nate possibly can be.  So I may not be the best in world because I have my limitations, but I want to be the absolute best I can be.  And what I've found in doing the work is there are some elements I'm not good at. And I would like to let other people do them so that my product is absolutely excellent.  And I don't know how to delegate it because I don't really know what I'm doing exactly. I'm just doing it.

10:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. it. it. it. So I'm thinking about previous things that I've done for other people. And maybe  Maybe the best way is, maybe I share some screens and I don't show you so much the content because that's theirs.  But you can get a feeling of different directions because there's like a couple of things going on right now in terms of projects, right?  I've been doing projects that are kind of like product management or like helping people specify a product from their expertise like a software or something.  There's something that is around creating visual frameworks for explaining what you do and I think this come up kind of naturally.  I think it talks with, it speaks to the one page kind of thing. The other thing is more the workshop thing.

11:52 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I'm happy to help you with the workshop.

11:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  feels to me that is not really the thing that would be the most important now. No.

12:01 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's the visual frameworks. It's making this visual. I also just hired Ingrid Will. I don't know if you know her.

12:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The name is familiar.

12:11 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  She draws. I was going to hire her to teach me how to draw better. I felt like it actually won't help because I need someone on the outside to draw this out of me.  But I'm saying that because I'm very interested in visualizing this.

12:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. Okay. Let's do it. The way I did the frameworks with that friend was we did like four or five sessions.  And we had a structure, but eventually things to go out of its own. But there's two main lenses. One is your perspective and the other is your process, right?

12:55 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  The first one is worldview.

12:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you think about things? What things do you about in a different way, like what's the Nate perspective.  And the other one was more about what's the Nate way, so to say. And the way we did that was through a series of first questions and discussions.  The questions were just prompts, right? And from that, like live, I would start to doodle and say, this thing you're telling me reminds me of this kind of image.  Maybe this is a circle. Maybe this is pyramid. This reminds me of a story. And eventually, we arrived at some drafts, and then I cleaned up those drafts in design software.  And they become beautiful images that you could use. And from four sessions, we arrived at, I think, 12 works.  Perfect. That they cover different things, because I really believe that it's very difficult to have one master framework. Yes.  Mm-hmm. So we have frameworks around. What was different regarding client qualification? What was different around safety because it was related to the health of his business?  What's different around the experience he provides?

14:13 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It was really a different business.

14:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  was psychedelic retreat. Yeah, yeah. And so the perspective was trying to get different POVs at the thing that he does and then figure out how to use them in different moments.  if that's the thing, I can still, I can see us do that and be useful. Yeah.

14:40 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Now what I'm imagining is I would like to have like for any topic I bring up just one slide, one visual framework that I'm pointing to and talking about and we're referencing because I find having that third item, that one slide, that one infographic that we're talking about and we keep  interacting with creates a lot of coherence in the conversation where we're both seeing things the same way because we keep pointing to the same item.  Yeah, you're kind of making sure that people remember it the way you said it, right?

15:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's a good way to say it. Okay, so let's let's let's do this. The sessions we had were like one and a half hours.  Yep.

15:34 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It was four of them.

15:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not really not concerned about the numbers just to give you a sense. And it end to end, I think it took like six weeks maybe.  Okay.

15:45 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Is this is okay with you?

15:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Great. And for this conversation, this conversation is a little bit too short for that, but maybe you can use the time for other things.  Um, or would you do you have more time because I do have more time? can, yeah, you're so smart, man.

16:10 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  If you'll give me the time, I'll give you the time. I want I'm very busy right now, but I will make time to work on this because I know you're good.

16:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, um, if you're very, if you're very busy and the first part of the process as as a little bit of reflection, I think it's best if we, I'll send you a link that's easier to schedule things.  I think it's best if you really like frame it as I will speak to, Joao for this much, much time in a sequence.  So I'm contradicting myself. I think if you are very busy, if you have lot of things on your mind, maybe it's best if you just set that time.  And a specialist, a master at craft told me that the best way is to suggest a date. Can I suggest a date?

17:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay.

17:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I need to change the time zones. Are you on, is it one o'clock in the afternoon over there?

17:10 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, it's 2.30 p.m. Eastern time.

17:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  2.30, so you're two hours behind me, perfect. So on Tuesday, if you are two hours behind Tuesday, would 10 o'clock for you work?  10 a.m.

17:33 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Oh, apologies.

17:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm missing something. I need, what time do you start working? Very early.

17:41 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  can work early. I have a meeting that Thursday from 8 to 9 a.m., which is, I think, 10 to 11 a.m.  every time. yeah, otherwise I'm available.

17:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I have a daily thing that it intersects with that window. But you want to have a meeting... your time, which is 6 a.m.

18:01 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)

19:05 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)

20:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, my wife's company is called Veritas, but with a Z at the end. I think every company should be called Veritas.

20:42 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's a good point.

20:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, we're all called Veritas now.

20:49 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I didn't know that, though. Yeah.

20:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay, okay. And then we can just do that recurring for a while.

21:05 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Do you want to? For sure.

21:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's what's best for you to do it recurring every Tuesday at the same time? Sure. There you go. So we have another date with a couple of dates.

21:41 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay.

21:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what do we do now? Can we not do March 4th? Can we just skip that week? Oh, that's clever because, yes,  is I would be traveling as well so we skip to the next one right yeah that's great got it man I am so excited about this because I know this whole how I mean one thing about that Dave Gray group is the people like you are such a cool person and I don't know how I would have found you you know what I mean I mean I would yeah I really changed my life and it changed my life through the things I've learned from you it was really yeah I agree and it also makes me think about all the amazing people we are not meeting yeah right because I don't join communities all the time I joined that one but yeah there's a lot of interesting people doing cool stuff yeah but you can only know so many people I know you and I'm like okay that's pretty good because I know I know a lot

23:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And frankly, it's too many people. can't keep track of it. You must know a lot of people, really, yeah.

23:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's too many.

23:10 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Oh, yeah.

23:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Certainly in sales and being, I don't know if you're extroverted, you seem comfortable talking to people. So yeah, I'm thinking out loud.  So you know me by now, we do this. And my dilemma is I want to be, you know, effective and productive and impactful in the time we have.  But I don't know if there's a thing we can, a can of worm can open and close in this much time.  But I don't want leave the call. just want to keep talking to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

23:49 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  OK, OK, OK. So, yeah. Well, can I show you this? This is really stupid. Yeah, yeah, it's so cool.  It has a piano, can see.

23:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, I got a piano, yes.

24:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  But but let me let me show you this. I just am really proud of this thing. Okay. Hold on Here's my little Coffee Uh-huh coffee look over there.  Wait, can you see that I can see I can see that cool cool right over here I don't know.  I'm just really it actually doesn't really work the way. I'm doing it, but but I'm really proud of it and I like sitting in here.  I think what It's like a african necklace. Oh Shells yeah And I got it from my grandmother who she is the coolest style man my grandma's so cool.  She's like 91 now and over the weekend I went to Chicago and to visit her and Her memory is not very good, but she really likes to sing So like I brought her over to the piano and I'm just playing stuff and she's singing along  She's very reserved but with singing she's like, yeah, you know and it's so special to sing with a 91-year-old Woman, but human being, know and when I was there she gave me Oh, that was cool.  She had that so There's probably a story behind it as well, right? Oh, I'm sure yeah, they This is a little bit like Not positive.  well, it's what it's just how it is I'm the sixth generation of entrepreneurs that came to America like in my grand time of family and These guys really succeeded As entrepreneurs what my grandma's uncle was one of the richest men in the world.  He was on Forbes's 100 he had 400 million dollars in the 60

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Wow.

26:02 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  the thing is like, I was never a part of that, you know, like we grow up, we didn't have any money growing up, but that's okay.  And I still, you know, but they made calculators, mechanical calculators. And it was called Victor Adding Machines and they were one of the first calculator manufacturers in the world.  And they did really well with it and they sold a bunch of calculators. then at one point, and this is the part where I go, in World War II, the United States invented this thing called the Norden Bombsite.  I heard about it.

26:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That was a big deal, right?

26:43 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It was one of the main competitive advantages of the United States because they were so accurate with the bombs.  And this company that our family owned made all of them in secrecy because they were able to do precision manufacturing.  Calculator, so and this is the part where you're like, what's a man? like true like The one that they dropped the atom bomb, but they need it and so you I have that up not like I'm proud of it, but It's just kind of I Don't actually know what to make of it.  It's like that's a really horrible thing We participated in it. I Understand that like it did stop the war.  It just I don't know when I look at that. I go. I'm kind of rendered speechless. I just go man Some people have to make really tough decisions.  I'm glad I don't have to yeah, I didn't know situations, you know, but anyway, that's That was my grandma's family, you know I get I get I think I get what you what would you say?

27:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Also have a kind of a weird relationship to technology and guns and like as a kid I was like in Portugal we don't have gun nuts there's no gun nut culture because of video games I like guns and stuff like that yeah right but right and eventually my my opinion was like I think they're mechanically cool I hope a lot of people don't have them and I'm glad it's hard to get them in Portugal yes but I think they're cool so it's weird when I started talking about it some people are like yeah yeah and some other people are like no that's terrible and shouldn't exist it's a bit of a conflicted thing I think it's just appreciating like intricacy and like there's so many smart things smart tricks about like sights and things that really clever yeah so I I can appreciate that so it's yeah I don't well I don't like guns I don't feel comfortable around them they scare me

29:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  around them yeah for me they're a little bit abstract that they're never around so yeah i've only ever a few times i've shot them like i've gone to a shooting range and and i'm like you know i'm not good at it you know and because that's a thing in the united states people just go to shooting ranges and shoot guns um but i just maybe it's overly like maybe it's a childish view of the world but i just hate i hate war i think i think people i mean that's so easy to say that but i think people who advocate for war say basically like that's just how it is people are going to try to hurt you so you've got to beat them first so you don't get hurt and maybe that's true i mean again that's why i feel relieved that i don't have to make those decisions because you know i went to a picnic once and there was an old man there and he was in world  or two. And I was very young, so I asked this question. It's completely inappropriate, but I said, did you kill anyone?  And he said, yeah. And I said, what was that like? And he said, you didn't think about it. You were so scared.  You just thought they're going to kill me. I have to kill them. And that's all I could think about.  And he didn't really have anything to say. And I didn't ask to be on that. But that's just, I'm glad I'm not in a situation.  For sure, for sure.

30:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So anyway, got heavy.

30:36 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  heavy.

30:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now it's a safe space. But I also loved the office as a space, as a concept. You grew up having an office or a room in the house that was kind of an office for the family or something?  Not really.

30:54 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  We had a really small house growing up and down the oldest of six kids. So there was just no room.  Um, but I also love the idea of an office like it me. I think if it as a studio, like an artist and or like a laboratory or something, you know, and it's It's like a refuge.  Yeah. Did you grow up with a space like that? Uh, yeah, I did.

31:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, there's only two of us. Um, there was a place in the house that was the office and it was always like that.  And as my parents moved out, they always tried to find place with an office and and for me, it's exactly like what you said.  It's a mix between a studio and a lab and um, maybe you've seen my office before. don't know. Have you show me?  want to see it man.

31:51 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So, oh yeah, the books come on. No, but this is not the messy part.

31:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is the messy part. it is stable. I love it.

32:05 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I love it. And I love it too.

32:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking of, you know, I'm thinking about the next iteration of it. This table is like seven years old or something like that.

32:16 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah.

32:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'm thinking because I think I think we both like the idea of processes having things at hand, knowing how things are done, you know, where to store stuff and where to find it.  But then I keep fiddling with it, right? Always. I never stop. Yeah.

32:44 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  But tell me, tell me more about that. And I'm asking you because I actually never stop. I keep moving stuff.  And then this is here. And then this is there every week. And I can't figure out why you do that.  I don't so much move things around.

33:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I'm always thinking about, remember that when we said, when we spoke about playing with Lego, I think it's a little bit like that.  So I love watching walking tours of workshops on YouTube, like people that have workshops. Yeah. And I'm always thinking, oh, maybe I need a place for the pen.  And if I put the pen here, or... Yes. There's a kind of thing that I'm always fascinated by, which is like physical things for thinking.  I think I interrupted you. You were saying something. I was just excited and was yelling, yeah. Okay. So go ahead.

33:51 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay.

33:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is a silly example, right? But I was making like a habit tracker. And I love these kind of switches.

33:58 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yes. Walker switches.

33:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

34:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And there was a box and I called ship it box and I put the track. There's no electronics, right?

34:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  no, no.

34:07 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And I made like labels for it.

34:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the idea was like, I do this during the day. And at the end, I'm like, Oh, yeah, I did these things.  And then I reset them. But creating these was a lot of fun. This was like, five minutes was waiting for the rocker switches, switches, but I never use it.  So the idea of creating Oh, I'm creating a machine or a thing that will help me. Is it very excited?  Much more excited than I'll use the machine I've created. That's that's a whole different thing, right? I'll just have it.  That's that's really interesting.

34:43 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I'm exactly the same. I'm made I'm always making systems and making devices and making like tools. And I never use them.  The only thing that I use every single day, no question. Just white pieces of printer paper and then I have this you know and when I'm done with them I take it and I put it in there and sometimes I go through them and highlight stuff I can sometimes I just throw it out but I'll show you one more thing this is one of my favorite items and I use it every day I'm so surprised I do.  It's funny. I need to create one.

35:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it a date stamp?

35:33 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Because I'm telling you it's so satisfying to be like first of all it's like a mess here but then this is mechanical and clear and you just like all right I got to set it for today so it's the 13th right?  So I set it I ink it Boom and then there it is and it's just a great feeling now it's official it well that's how it feels  It's like, you know, so I guess you'd like that you'd use that, you know.

36:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I used to have one just for the logo, but this is a different thing is a different thing.  So let me show you like this was my vacation kit. Yeah. And there was some index cards on it is an icon box.  Yeah, cool. And I love this. And this is really like that blog that you gave me a subscription for the notes blog.  Oh, I like, I really like that blog.

36:34 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  She's cool.

36:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That was really like that crazy thing. lost it, but I took it like a pencil and I cut it in half.  So it's a smaller than I put it here. And I would just travel with this. And then I have my inbox, which is this thing.  Yeah, yeah, I just throw it there. I recognize game right and and then I use I also use this.  So I got these clips. from like Cards when you enter a building there's a card Visitor thing so I got them.  They're really cheap and I got magnets. Oh my gosh And I glued it to them, but the magnets don't stick too well.  So I like Group the paper. Yeah, and then I stick it on something metal.

37:21 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, sorry.

37:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's done the one thing Yeah, that's yes, but I don't you yeah, it is cool And you know, then I don't I don't use it.

37:29 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I just then I think about the next thing and So I have to send you this article. It was in the Atlantic.  It and I think you may love it Are you might be a late bloomer is what it's called.

37:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hmm. And did I tell you about this?

37:45 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Just on Come again.

37:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's about the artist says on No, I don't think I don't think it is. So listen to this.

37:54 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  This is insane The article says there are two kinds of people who Let's see, there are early bloomers and late bloomers.  Early bloomers are like Michael Jordan or Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg. They have a big idea. They know what they want to do and they just, they go do it.  Late bloomers are completely different in their nature. They're not early bloomers who just didn't get around to it. They're completely different.  What are late bloomers? They are people who are obsessed with learning. And what happens a lot of the time is their artists throw out their work.  They never keep their work. And everyone's like, what are you doing? You're a painter and you're painting every day.  And then when you're done painting, you throw out your paintings. That makes no sense to us. But through these people, and I'm one of these people, I would bet you're one of them.  It's the process of learning. Their life is this experiment. And they're like, what happens if I touch this? What happens if I touch that?  And so here are some of the traits of a late bloomer, okay? They have they have an issue with authority Don't tell me what to do.

39:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I got to like go figure it out.

39:06 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So They have what's called epistemic humility, which means they believe they don't know very much and they're fine with that They can actually see the true bounds of their knowledge They They tend to endure a brutal wandering period in their rears like most of them don't arrive until their 40s or 50s They like don't like if you ask them, what do you do?  They could not answer and Cezanne when he was 22 decided to be a painter and he did not sell a painting till he was 57 22 to 57 he was painting and everyone rejected every painting he made But he was like obsessively doing it from between 57 and 59.  He Book off. Museums started buying stuff. People started coming to his house just to watch him work. They were so amazed, but like these people endured just brutal wandering periods.  And I feel like I've been in that, and I don't know if you relate to that, but it's hard to be us.  people don't, you're so bright, but people are like, why aren't you, or they say this to me, why aren't you doing something?  I'm like, because everything I'm doing is something. What do you mean, why don't I do something?

40:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You want to just nod and pretend to agree. Yeah, yeah, now it's my ignore.

40:37 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  But so anyway, I'll send you the article. It's so cool. I will.

40:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  will. You'll love it. Yeah, for sure, for sure. And it's, you know, one of the things that really wanted to check out the article because one of things that I've noticed that sometimes I meet people online and you're getting  conversations and there's a lot of them have like traits like this right because they define me or find them through their comments or their content and we have like a kinship of minds yes and recently I started working with a guy as a client and he's really bright and you chunk of his personality and I was like this is not the first guy that I talked to that is like different so thank you and and then I went to read about about that like working with really you know clever people so but there's not a lot of books I couldn't find a lot of books on that actually I was intrigued like maybe NASA as like a guide on how to work with engineers or yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody knows this for an explicit way. But this is also an interesting reference that you're sending me, because I can really see that becoming part of a conversation, or like a reference that I sent people.

42:20 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, think it probably will be for you, because when you read it, for me, I felt like a sense of peace after I read it.  This is what I've been doing. And I couldn't explain to anyone. And what it made me feel was I may not be able to explain what I'm up to to people until I'm 50.  OK, if that's the truth, then I can be patient. But I just felt so lost. I didn't have any way to even tell myself, just wait till you're 50, and it all makes sense.  Yeah, yeah.

42:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I saw somewhere. I don't remember where I saw it. I think it was not. trailer. I don't know if you follow him.  I like his stuff. He talks about he advises agencies and consulting businesses. And one of the things that he said was that when your explanation of what you do, which goes beyond the professional, understand, but really clicks with your actual markets, it usually doesn't click with anyone else, right?  So if you are at the barbecue and you tell your cousin what you're doing, you don't get it. But if you're talking to your ICP, you get the kind of reaction that you got, oh, I need you, come here, right?  And you need, one of the things that he said on the book was that people that have like this oversized capacity, I don't know, capability, they need, they need to shift their locus of evaluation inwards, like  Trust your gut, right? I just thought the expression was fancy, but that's that's how they say it because you can Easier said than done, but you can't really rely on outside understanding and approval for that which can be only right Yeah, well and that's You do have a good guy you do and I did and Isn't it interesting When you ask other people for their thoughts on the matter, where is that?

44:40 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's up here What do you think? What do you think it's all up here? It is nothing to do with the gut and what I found what I'm finding with this consulting offering everything I'm doing is from the gut and people are Just repeating  to me, what I'm telling them from the gut. So before I was saying, what do you think about what I'm doing?  They'd give a bunch of random thoughts. I don't know if it works. don't know it makes sense. Now I'm going to people saying that I'm doing this incredible.  All I've ever wanted to do is learn. And I found a way to turn learning into a business. You would be blown away by what I'm doing.  I don't even know if they would. But I feel it's true in my gut. And I'm telling that to people, you know what they're saying?  I am blown away by what I'm doing. It's so incredible. You turned learning into, I'm like what? Are people just mirrors?  You know, if I'm uncertain, they reflect uncertainty. If I'm confident, they reflect confidence. know, Saint Francis of Assisi had that saying, the world is a mirror.  And I think there is something in that.

45:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think there's a lot in that for sure. I didn't see it before. I used to think there was like one truth, capital T.  if I found it,

46:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  would be okay.

46:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then eventually I've made this that I don't think there is, there are truths things we can rely on, but it's not like a equation for everything, I think.  And it's also something like this kind of, we don't do the same thing, but we kind of play with the same ideas and same concepts.  And this kind of world relies so much on, maybe it sounds pretentious, but it relies on a lot of self-awareness, I think.  And really subtle, really subtle things, like I would imagine that even if it comes from your gut. Yeah. I could, I would bet that you know you could link the concepts that your gut has, right?  small example, I've learned that it's much better to reward people for the things you want to see than to punish them for the other things, right?  At some point, this was a new thing and a very conscious thing. But now it's kind of enmeshed. And but it doesn't mean that it's just random, it's not random.  There's like a little nugget that sometimes somewhere I've learned, like, oh, there's this thing. And it's really difficult to transfer all those little nuggets into to another person, right?  so, yeah, they leave on the gut, they come from the world and they take a home in the gut, maybe, you know, but there's a there's a really cool book.

47:41 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I think it was before it's called The Art of Judgment by John Adair. I think you did, but I didn't get it.  He, well, it's okay. But he, he says, like, when you're young, if you want to develop judgment, you need to have a lot of decisions that you make, practice making decisions.  then Whenever it happens, you need to go through the process of analyzing, synthesizing, and valuing your decision. So analyzing is like breaking it down into its constituent parts.  Synthesizing is seeing how they all work together and which has priority, and valuing is like which were the most important elements.  He said if you do that work about every decision, it's like each time you do that you're writing a computer program to embed in your subconscious, but your subconscious can run every one of those programs at the same time.  So you slowly create the program with your actual overt mind. And then when it's in your gut where you're subconscious, you can run them all at once.  And that's how people can develop such amazing intuition because they built programs all through the years, and then they'll come up to a situation and go, just do that.  Yeah. Well, they can say just do that because 200 programs just ran and filtered all of it at once.  It's amazing.

49:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes, it's like a model for explaining expertise, building, right? You do this because I also think like people that become experts are usually passionate about that thing.  Yeah. Because it's a relative term, right? You can know a lot about something, but if you're an expert, you're not it's relative.  And if you're really passionate about something, you really want to learn about that thing. Yeah. I think.

49:32 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah.

49:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's, you know, maybe you've noticed this about me, like when I started looking outside the frame, it's me thinking and yeah, so, and I think people that do this, are they thinking this way?  They get it, but sometimes people think I'm not interested. And that's how I do it. Like if I'm like this, you know I'm interested.  Yeah, you're defragging, right? that idea. I'm excited we were chatting. I'm excited for the amazing news that you told me for your office.  I mean, this was a great start of the year and it's really good talking to you. And I'm excited to be able to to to retribute.  Stay back. It doesn't bring us as well, but it really, it really helped me, you know. And by the way, you know, I thought, so this is the thing.  I want to write a testimonial. And the first testimonial I thought about writing was around you teaching me the sales things.  Yeah, but I'm not sure if that's the best angle for the thing you're doing now. it wouldn't be. Yeah, so but because we've spoken for so much, I mean, there's so many ways you've helped me, not  in the sales team. And I think one of the things that you have, tools and concepts to talk about putting one's expertise into context, like the examples you give and the books and the articles and the names and the stories.  I think maybe that's a good angle for a testimonial that would be you know true and really helpful. I'm very open also to record it on a video if you want to do one of like video things.  Super I would do that if you want to interview me if you want me to record the video. I can do all of all of the above.

51:46 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah I'll take it I'll take video I'll take and then we can just take the transcript from the video.  Sometimes it's helpful written because you can just text it to people and you know but the video helps too because they feel it they're like oh yeah.  Yeah, it's – thank you for that. And I'm able to – you said elicit expertise. That's an interesting phrase.  I'm able to get people to say what their expert's at. I think because I've read and worked in companies at such a broad, so many different things, I have the basic vocabulary for a lot of different fields.  So I never – well, I haven't so far been lost. I'm not lost. I can – I don't make people repeat anything.  The first time I get it, you know? And I mean, I was working with a company and they do virtual design construction.  So they're laying out the electrical conduit in a hospital building in a Revit before it's built. And I was able to get on the phone with their head.

53:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  blue beam rabbit drawings guy and I immediately was like yeah I get it if you're doing an under slab below the building and you have the conduit you're laying every 10 feet you have to have the support but how do I know that I don't know he said it and I just it it lands so I think it's just a lot of work over the past 20 years that makes you like not fluent but able to put jazz with most people uh-huh someone also from the now I totally see it's someone from also from the school of possible Dom I don't know if he spoke to Dom yeah I know that yeah used like this is analogy of navigating right so navigating it to rain versus going down the path yeah so like you see the moss growing on the side of the rock and you see like that's like navigation you don't need the map but you know to find your way right

54:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  yes and if you've crossed many different terrains you've learned all these little rules about oh there's the moss and the ecti and uh and the palm tree and the ice is blue and there's different terrains you can read that's exactly what it is you know that christopher columbus uh-huh he was good at what's called dead reckoning and dead reckoning is the same thing as navigating he's like okay i'm going this way no i'm gonna go that way like he's making micro adjustments the whole time he was always like on the fly making decisions he didn't have a big plan that he followed slowly he was just like doing this you know isn't that interesting very very and also like it makes sense were there maps of the the coast how would you

55:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But only that guy could like for that, for that kind of context, you need a guy that can do that, right?  You don't need a guy that can read the map, you need the guy that can heal the sea, right?  Well, and that's there's this book I told you about this to Ed Friedman, The Failure of Nerve.

55:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And his argument is that there's so much uncertainty in the world that the best oftentimes the best way to problem solve is not to solve the problem, but to outlast it.  And he says, in time. So actually, more than acumen, you need stamina. And he's like, this is a true way that you can get through many, many problems.  And I think that's a brilliant insight. It's similar to the Gordian knot, you know, how everyone's trying to figure out how to unravel it and Alexander the Great comes in and just cuts it in

56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that boldness is an actual way to solve problems beyond into a into actualization I think that's very interesting yes yes so last year one of the maybe I've told you this but for a long long time I thought that if I build up competence I would build up confidence yeah and you get up on top of the hill and then you see the horizon is further still and yeah you have more competence not more confidence yeah and it hit me like this year like when I was about to turn 37 I was like whatever we're doing and um and so confidence building confidence became like a theme like oh okay this is the thing I should I should follow and I should pay attention to how what kind of things make me feel confident right and just these days I found a guy that he seemed to have taste I don't know how to say what the guy seemed to have taste and I made some jokes is there a book you recommend  And he told me about the book, which is a book for advertisement people called Damn Good Advice. And I think 80% of the book is about just be bold and have guts and trust your instinct and your creative capacity.  It's not a normal book. I can send some pictures so you get a feeling of the book. Do you know that book Ignore Everybody?  Yeah. It's the same sort of book, like career advice for creative people. Well, there's the confidence thing comes back and back again.  Just holding yourself, go through it, not smile and ignore. You really need to.

57:49 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  You know who's good on this? Drew Broughton, D-R-E-W-E. in his B-R-O-U-G-H-T-O-N, he's on LinkedIn. He was a soccer player in the Premier League, and he just struggled his entire 10-year career, and he in the end completely failed.  I mean, he lost everything. He lost his family. He went bankrupt. He was fired. He ended up in like a addiction center, and he asked like, what am I?  Because everything I have is gone. What am I? And what he believed, what he came to him was, to where it's sweat and courage.  He said, I can try with effort, and I can try with boldness, and that's all I can do. And I just have to follow God and try every day to do that.  know, God is like inspiration, so I actually am taking his course It's a group of guys, a couple of them are Premier League players.  mean, it's incredible. And he calls himself the fear coach, and he's like, the number one thing you need to get good at is accepting that you will always be afraid.  You're always going to have fear. You can't, like, get rid of it. And you act boldly and with stamina anyway.  And I think that's so inspiring. Like, when you see his posts on LinkedIn, he doesn't even have good grammar.  Like, he misspells everything. But, like, he's compelling, you know? I mean, and it's real. I'm just so excited to be working with him.  mean, it's just really, he's cool. I believe him. Yeah.

59:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I gotta do that. Yeah, you gotta check it out.

59:44 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, I've got to get this SOW put together before my call-up for PM. So, I'm going to go, man, I love talking to you.  This was fun.

59:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I love, yeah, I love talking to you as well. And it gave me a lot of things to think about.  You saw, like, the percentage of time that I was... spending looking outside it's like a progress spiral of like oh my god there's much to process thank you thank you for that yeah it's great yeah you too man i mean i'm this is going to be integral to me i just told my wife i have to get visuals for what i'm doing i've been telling you that for a month you know so this is awesome cool by the way if you want to send me any other stuff like the way you write the proposal or any templates that you have i knew it's the beginning but i'm very open to use that to to feed the okay yeah i'll send stuff yeah if it comes out yeah thank you so much have a nice one see you back
