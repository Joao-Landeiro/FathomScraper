0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Did you shave? You look younger. I don't know. Something looks different for you. Yeah, I do.

0:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I just make my machine, I guess, so I need to use the all-or-nothing thing. Yeah, all-or-nothing.

0:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That happens with my husband sometimes. like, oh, I can't find that like thing.

0:19 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  it's just like...

0:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm 16 again. Yeah, exactly.

0:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  My husband is surprising.

0:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  has like a lot of...

0:28 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, he has a great hair and everything. But like when he shaves, he looks super young. It's really funny.

0:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But yes, there's Brian. Look at it. Hey, Brian. Hi, Brian. Hi.

0:44 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  How are you doing?

0:45 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Good. How are you?

0:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Good.

0:48 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Good.

0:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you have a good holiday? I guess Thanksgiving was probably the latest holiday. Yeah, it was last month. Yeah, that was last month.  And that was off last week. Okay, that's how it was. Let's see, I've got a few people in. Great.  right. We have everyone in the call now as my computer freezes a little. I see Abby's there, Okay, Mal, why don't you guys introduce yourselves, and then maybe Brian and Abby can introduce yourselves, and then we can jump into the demo and some questions.  Yeah. Got it.

1:34 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Mal, you want to do it? You're the BDT leader. All right.

1:41 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes速)
  First of all, hi everybody. My name is Maurizio Medeiros. You can call me Mal Medeiros. I'm part of the Brazil design team, and we've been working on this project for the last month, a month and a half.

1:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'm here to help the Brazilian.

2:00 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes速)
  which coordinate everything that we are doing right now and developing on the platform. Yeah, and I'm part of the Brazilian design team.

2:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  My name is Jo達o. It's very difficult to pronounce.

2:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Think of it as John, Jan, Jo and that kind of thing.

2:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I'm mostly looking at the architecture of the service. if you guys probably talked or met the eggs design team, they did a really good job at the initial architecture for the platform, and now we're taking it from them.  And Jo and Mao have also worked with the eggs design team.

2:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They actually used to be part of eggs Brazil. So that's why it's also a very good handover so they know, you know, Pinar and Rui, or at least Rui from before.  So that's why it's also been pretty seamless handing over to them. And Abby, do you want to introduce yourself?  Sure, I'm Brian.

3:03 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  I'm based in New Jersey, and I'm a compliance analyst here at Senita.

3:10 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  And I'm Abby, based in Oslo, Norway, I am the office and culture manager. So I do just a little bit of everything.  Nice to meet you.

3:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So also, since we last talked, right, I don't know. Abby, I don't know if we've signed on Cognite and RDoC.  now we have between you guys as Annetta and Stryce, we have all the big high growth companies.

3:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we're quite excited.

3:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think we can also leverage some of the things. Cognite is really pushing for ISO 14001. So we can also use a lot of the learnings from that.  And then also, you guys as a digital company also can use very much of their same product. sussies in it.

4:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I think that's really, really great. I will show you the prototype that has been made since we last spoke.  I think it's been at least a month and a half.

4:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So there might be a few new things that you guys haven't seen. Love to get your feedback on it and then also get some thoughts about like planning for the new year in terms of what areas you would be interested in focusing on because we kind of have like several options.

4:26 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But let me go through the tool and show you first where we are.

4:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Feel free to stop me if you have any questions along the way. So this is a compliance map, right?  And we may be updated a little bit just with this plan, do, check, and act because it's very linked to the ISO methodology.  So we want to make sure that the ISO auditors understand where to look at to be able to kind of pass that process very quickly.  Because we're setting this up around environmental management systems and compliance management systems.

5:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I think we went through policies, trainings and communications before, right?

5:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Along with controls.

5:06 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  that correct?

5:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you remember? Yeah, it looked a little bit different, but yes. Okay.

5:11 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So since then we've done risk assessment.

5:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Brian, I know you're doing part of the risk assessment, right? Right now too. it also be good to see if we can map some of these processes.

5:24 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I was discussing with awkward horizon this week.

5:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Also try to map your third party process into our tool.

5:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But how we have set it up is that you can, we kind of list the different risks that you would have in your universe, the typical ones that you would have.

5:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we help you, you will tell you exactly what you need to do in terms of after you have these initial risks, you should do some additional checklists of, you know, have you looked into transparency, access, have looked into company policies?  Have you done research on competitors? So we tell you the typical steps a consultant would take that you need to manage for the risk assessment.

5:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then you need to say yes and you need to document that you've done it for the...

6:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  process so it shows that it's there and then and then and then we have a questionnaire that that you would send out based off of the risk that you have to different stakeholders and then they would come back with that it's based on the double materiality is for CSRD you know probability impact organization and then you would have you would have you know kind of a risk profile that that comes in that you can manage and map out your controls too so we would be kind of helping you set this up so that's the risk assessment process we've also done one for third-party management which is around your supplier base and we kind of tell you like okay you need to pull it annual spend from the supplier you select the supplier based off of it you would sample them by the different risks within the industry so we kind of walk you through each one and then you'd upload the vendor list and then from that you would be able to send them information to send them information like you know follow-up meetings have them do trainings and  And then we've also have an employee portal. This has got the old design, but we have a new one where these is where employees go in and they would have their tasks assigned to them like they need to fill out the annual conflict of interest forms.  need to read the government officials policy. They need to do the code of conduct training. And then these are the different submissions that they would have so that they can follow up on.  So that's kind of what we've done since we've last talked. So now we're in the like actually development phase.

7:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  policies, procedures and trainings is done in our tool.

7:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then we have risk assessment controls and third phase will be ready by the end of this year. So it's kind of like in January, the question is like, so now we're setting up follow up calls with all of our pilots at the end of January to kind of plan to see like, what would be interested in deploying or testing out?  What documentation can we get ready now so that you have ready to deploy at a certain time period? Do you wanna focus on some of our pilots?  like we want E because we want to get the ISO certification very quickly because we're getting that request for government tenders.  We have a few customers that are saying like, no, I'm not going to go for the ISO. I just want to make sure my actual level of my G part is compliance is ready.  So I'm just going to go through the compliance part.

8:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We do have a few that say like, I just want the workflow tool.

8:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't need any of the ISOs.

8:21 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I just want to be able to deploy my policies in a manner and track them whether or not they're competition policies or anti bribery policies.  And then we have a few, you know, some, some pilots are like start now because we want to get this as soon as possible.

8:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Other ones are like start in February. We're not in a rush.

8:38 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I think it's more trying to discuss with you guys what your thoughts are.

8:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But maybe before we even go there, I think it would be good to make Zhao or Mao like, I don't know if you guys have any design questions or if you or yeah, how should we, how should we do this or Brian or if you have any feedback on what you saw.

9:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Um, we could also do that too, so when it when it comes to risk management, right, is it able to like it assigns each risk, like a number, like a specific key, let's say it's risk one, that it's connected to that specific policy, which will be the control or which will be the, you know, what it's protecting or kind of like covering that risk.  Yeah, and also for third party, you know, it's also going to going to link back to risk. So like, let's say we have a vendor that we're sharing, you know, some some confidential information, right?  And there is some sort of risk, but we've we've already flagged that risk is that it's possible to like link that.  So it's all within the same. The same the same. I guess the same risk, right? So I don't know if I'm being clear.  Yeah, I think I know I know what you mean.

9:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we are really focusing.

9:58 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So if you think this is not.

10:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I can and it's not set up to be an enterprise risk management tool. So we're really focusing on sustainability and compliance risk there.  And so so then if you say, OK, we help you identify what are the typical environmental risk for a digital company?

10:13 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  What are the typical sustainability compliance risk for the company? And then based on that, the policies, procedures, trainings and controls will match the risk that you have there.  And then you go to the third parties.

10:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The third parties will be like asking questions about those risks that you identify to make sure that they, you know, have they are not exposing you to those risks, and then there's follow up points to that you can do.  I hadn't thought about like tagging the exact number to the supplier, but I don't I think like we could in the vendor detail page.  can probably be like, these are the risks and list them. So I think that's also part of like the pilot.  If we test it out, you say, OK, I need to have it this. We can kind of build it for you.

10:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But that's the that's the thinking behind it.

10:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK, great.

10:54 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And then for the for the questionnaires, the frameworks, are we able to?

11:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  like Pica specific framework and it's going to, that's going to just give the user a series of questions based on that specific framework or it's just, I don't know how that works or how you guys plan into.

11:14 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

11:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we have a questionnaire that we were building that's meant to make sure that it passes the ISO methodology.  That you can tailor based on what you want like add more risks or add different questions. But we're trying to make it like, these are the typical things.  There is no standard like you have to do a template this way. So at one point it's like, we need to agree on a template.  So if you guys just have a template that you like and another company has one, we can kind of bring it together or if you feel like, okay, it has to be very specific this way, we need to ask this specific questions, we can consider that too.  But we have like a general one that we think can work, but that's also part of the process is like for you to review the template, do you guys agree with it?

11:53 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Would you want to change it before you deploy it?

11:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, makes sense. I don't know what I'll be if you have.

12:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Many questions. feedback?

12:04 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)
  I feel like we will have to have a meeting with just like Zanetta people just to decide like what we think and maybe with Abby too um because you can maybe give us some like uh yeah your opinion um I don't know um we just got ISO certified like I don't know the differences between all the ISOs but we got like the security like security and privacy is most likely the 27 001 yeah yeah you guys use Vanta or did you guys use a company to help you or what did it was it was yeah it was a consulting company uh which pretty much gave us a template that has like had all the you know instructions policies and everything that you just have to follow up and kind of like fill out the what is needed yeah you know so that's kind of like what we're doing for the e like if you want to like explain that to your company it's like it's the same

13:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  thing we're doing, but for sustainability and compliance.

13:02 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  We're giving you all the templates, all of the walkthroughs, all of the information that you can collect in this.

13:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  One option you can think about for future security privacy, if you guys don't have a system, you can also use it because we're basing this off of the ISO methodology and the framework.  But we're prefilling it with sustainability and compliance content is what we're doing. But I'm happy to have a conversation with that and to also share a little bit more, but I think it's more up to you guys.  If you don't want to go for the ice, so that's fine, it's not a requirement, it's just more the methodology that we've set up.  Because since we've also talked is that we've set up some global agreements with some auditing firms, so that they understand our tool and they'd be able to give it to you at a more like a cheaper price because they're really in a faster audit because of working with us.

13:49 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So yeah, so I think we can also set up another meeting at the end of January.

13:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We kind of go through and meet, like I can go to the offices, Abby, and then like also meet more people and kind of talk about that.  So that's a part But is there any kind of, if you were to lean towards ISO 14001 or ISO 37001, like the compliance, the governance management or environmental management systems, do you guys have any, at least for pilot, because we're deploying, can do other ones, but I know we also looked into some of your carbon reporting and we're, as part of that, do you guys have any thoughts about To be honest, I'm not sure if we're like company-wide, we're looking into getting the SOC certification, so that's what's in the plans for next year.

14:40 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Which one?

14:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The SOC.

14:44 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  ES, what kind of one is that one?

14:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  ES.

14:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The service organization controls, there's SOC 1 and 2. Okay, so that's more about like business controls, like around like your services, it's not like your compliance.  No, that's

15:00 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  I mean, I think we would have to check with the. It's sack Abbie. Because he's the one that's working or he worked the ISO security one that 27001 and then he's planning to work on the this this new certification for for 2025.  So I would say it would be even good if you have the from far too you can meet with him and and we can.

15:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You know, explain and show him the form so he can take a look because he's also very involved in like, you know, maybe we should we get a show?

15:36 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  We get a, you know, what help are we going to get for this new certification? Is it similar to the ISO or, you know, maybe maybe for if I can help us with that too?  Yeah, no, I think that's that's fine.

15:50 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I could talk and also like, if you guys aren't like wanting the ISO, like, for example, I don't think Zaneto or Streis are not going for the ISO.  They just want it for their governance, kind of like the artificial.

16:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  question to have like actual love and have the G side of it because that's already been regulated like in place for the management and the board and the company.

16:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So we could also continue that because that also goes with the risk assessment and controls that you've seen in the demo.

16:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it doesn't necessarily need to be like kind of linked to ISO.

16:16 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  could be just something that you guys, if you guys want to do that, moving forward and testing it. Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I don't think we would go for the ISO.

16:24 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Like you said, the governance and compliance mostly because all the focus now it's the PSOC certification.

16:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I don't think it would be a priority.

16:34 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  environmental, probably, you know, that's not next year of the following.

16:41 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But right now it's more like security and, you know, all these certifications that comes with security and data and privacy and all that.  Yeah, yeah. So no, that's good.

16:53 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  So then we can also plan that like your legs in that and like stress focusing on the governance aspect that should be kind of implemented, you know, with the risk assessment.

17:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  the controls anyway and to be tested so that in case something happens then you at least have kind of that underway, not necessarily to an ISO but just more.  Yeah so we could also set up all the documentation for that too because if you go for ISO then you have to have certain words in your documentation and your policies.

17:19 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  If you don't go for that then you can simplify it a lot and then decide kind of like we're using this as the general anti-bribery encryption process within the organization.

17:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we can have a discussion but we're creating already a lot of the templates so it's like that's the good thing about having more and more digital companies like a lot of the risks within sustainability and compliance for digital companies is going to be the same so that we can also like kind of reuse them and use them and kind of learn from each other on that.

17:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So yeah great.

17:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Jao or Mao do you have any questions? I do but maybe I can leave them for for the end if you want to show more detail of the platform to collect some feedback.

17:59 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

18:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I can show the platform a little bit more and then see if there's any kind of questions on this.  Rui is a little bit better at kind of doing the design one, but in terms of I guess maybe like risk assessment, because Brian, you have been, where are you on the risk assessment process?  Because we have kind of discussed that you were just starting it when we talked to her.

18:25 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  So right now we have our matrix. I have been managing the risks in JIRA as a project, which kind of gives it like a specific key and then I'm able to move it through the different stages.  treatment, adding controls, monitoring.

18:46 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So that's what I'm doing right now.

18:48 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  And it's that and also the enterprise risk and also the IT and security risk that we have. it's a combination of kind of like IT.  and in compliance with what we're doing, but it's all in JIRA, Confluence JIRA. So it's not really a system that it's designed for risk.

19:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then you haven't like, from what I've seen, at least I've seen some of our customers when I've looked at their risk matrix, has, it's been more like typical, like security privacy kind of business type risk, right?  Not necessarily have you added a lot of sustainability and or compliance risk to it?

19:31 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  No, we don't have sustainability at all, and then our risks, it's more, yeah, it's more IT security.

19:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  IT security and employment, because we have offices around. So that could be an interesting exercise for the New Year is that we can help you identify even your environmental or your governance risk, even if you're not gonna necessarily act upon it yet, but at least you have kind of a list ready that if you wanted to do something.  you know, even slowly, like that could be good. I was thinking about like there are things that you could do without having a huge impact on an organization or having to go through a huge ISO, you know, you can just start collecting these things on the side, like kind of like you were doing for the carbon reporting and too.  So there are processes that you can kind of move forward even if you're not going for the ISO that could still help you in terms of managing your process.  I think that could be good there.

20:27 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Okay, so then, so then, yeah, but in terms of like, how about third parties? What are you guys doing around like third party management, like supplier?

20:38 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  We have a system that's managing them, that's for like more like on the negotiate, like to negotiate prices and that, but not really a third party managed, like when it comes to like DPAs and you know, the security part of the, or like the third party kind of conduct that we have one, but it's just.  You know, we're trying to find if this tool can help us send it out, get it signed and send it back to us.

21:09 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  we can have a documentation on suppliers. We don't really have a specific tool that it's used for third-party management.

21:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's all done through like, you know, SharePoint components.

21:25 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah.

21:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So this could be also something that we test out even like, you know, without ISO or not, because it's not necessarily be a big thing on the organization, but it's how you manage your external stakeholders.  So it's also something that we can maybe test out in the new year is saying, okay, we can do this.  And this is what we've seen actually with our customers, like some of the ones are like, we're not going to use the whole thing because risk assessment is in this department and this is this.  But we're going to use the policies, procedures, training and controls. know, others are like, we only want the third party.  So I think there are like, you don't have to do everything if you don't want to go for the ISO.

21:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So if you're going for the ISO, you have to do everything.

21:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But if you don't Then you can say, okay, I need to do this part because this is the part that's missing from our program.  So I think we could also discuss about that in January, kind of like what aspect would you like to try to work on, you know, if you're not going to go for ISO, then there are other things that you could do to fill in the processes of what you've done and automate and digitalize some of the processes that you're working on.  Yeah, that makes sense.

22:25 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  I would say we would have to align with SAC and see what the priorities are and, you know, if we can meet and, you know, we'll be able to tell you 100%, this is what we will be working this year and what's the plan for, you know, company-wide.  Yeah, that sounds good.

22:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Zhao, do you to have any questions or Mel, any questions?

22:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Yeah, I have a few.

22:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So thank you for the context, especially mentioning tools and alternatives is really valuable just to see how people solve the  things with what they have right now. let's see, I'll start from the end because these are the most recent.  You've mentioned, in terms of third-party management, what you have right now is probably closer to like a procurement tool to negotiate prices and agreements and like that.  And you've also said that you would like to have something, some tool that sends out these requests or these codes of conduct for maybe these vendors or other partners, get their agreement and collect it at the end.  Correct? Correct.

23:45 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah, the problem with supply, really problem is that it's a variety of suppliers. We have suppliers for food, is not neat for them to sign any documents and then we have those suppliers that probably  It's just data and personal information. So for them, we need to have them sign some third-party cut of conduct and also have and go over what they're processing, the processor for the GDPR and all that.  That side of privacy, but we don't have a tool right now. It's just us getting the documents, reviewing them, making sure it follows certain guidelines, and then agreeing whether it's OK or not for us to protect our information.  Got it.

24:33 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So and because you have different kinds of suppliers and different kinds of requirements, I assume that there's someone needs to match the kind of suppliers to the kind of requirement, right?  Oh, this is supplier.

24:48 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Yeah, so what we do is there is a ticketing system, right? That's through JIRA. So whenever an internal stakeholder submits the supplier, I can.  I've created a series of questions based on, you know, the different frameworks. it's like, what data it's processing is a customer data, it's a personal data, right?  And then based on the questions that are answered from the internal stakeholder that's negotiating or wanting the supplier, the conference coordinator takes a look at that and requests the necessary documentation.  And then we just save it in our folders. Got it, got it. How long does it take usually, minimax or internal stakeholder to submit the request or for us to review it?  For the whole process, like, there's someone coming in and they open a ticket.

25:45 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, they open a ticket, answer the questions.

25:48 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  Sometimes they know, sometimes they don't know, like, they don't know to detail what data there will be processing. it's like, I'm going to do, you know, there is an event that we will be sharing names.  and emails right so we would need to know how are they going to be processing that and so that it could be like I would say could take from a week to two weeks depending on the type of supplier and depending on how well the supplier is structured.  Some of them are like small companies that don't really know so you kind of have to guide them through some of the big companies that already have everything in place and then they just share like DPAs agreement and everything at once so you just have to review them.  Got it so would I be correct to assume that dealing with the smaller companies requires more handholding? It really depends on the type of company right what it's the supplier if it's like a small catering company that's just going to give us food then there is not like there's just like sign the agreements and the right there's like a company that's going to be processing data then  would need to do a little bit more work there. Are you guys running for all suppliers coming in?

27:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you running sanctions or PEP or politically exposed? Are you doing background checks on any of them?

27:13 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  None of them.

27:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Right now, we're focused on is the data processing, privacy, and making sure that they're combined with GDPR. That's it.

27:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So it could be like, yeah, we can help with that process in terms of expanding it a little bit more to other risks that the supplier might have, and then think about how to manage those risks within our platform.  We have the policies, procedures, trainings where we send out to employees to confirm. You can do a very similar thing to suppliers or different risks.  That's how we set it up in our system, is we don't necessarily do all of them. We do it the highest risk-based and different criteria within your supplier base.

27:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The catering doesn't need to do anything, but in best practice, even catering goes through a very simple PEP check, and then let the higher risk ones are the ones that have to send  after the policies or do the trainings depending on that and then how you how you manage them in the system.  So I think that could be actually like an interesting process to work with since you're already doing this kind of like a little bit digitalized but it could be optimized probably and like yeah so that could be one of the areas that we say we want to we're not going to do everything but this could be a good area to to test out the base.  Yeah that'll be good yeah because like I said it's data privacy data processing and that's all we we kind of like we're focused on right now and like protecting if we're sharing you know customer data with them then we're going to make sure that that's protected because it's confidential information so yeah yeah yeah no I think that that makes sense but I know we're also soon at time but I'm wondering um one do you have any more questions out before we try to find a time in in January in the calendars but I have so many no let's speak up  And I think it's best.

29:01 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah.

29:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I should find a time for the week of January 20th to follow up. I think that we can set up a time for January 20th to have a longer meeting.  maybe Abby or Brian, you and me can have another call maybe in beginning or middle of January just before the call to see who do you need to talk to and prep whatever.

29:27 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But then we can have a bigger kickoff meeting with the people that you have in the meeting. If you want, like, Carla or other people in it, we can plan for that.

29:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So when in the week of the 20th or 27th would be good for, like, a bigger Zendetta meeting with, like, more people from your teams.

29:44 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I would say the week of the 27th, just because there is a kickoff the first week of January, if I'm not wrong, or second week.

29:55 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  And then after that, it's probably people going to go back to their offices.

30:00 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  be a little bit busy so I would say 27 is best on that works should we do maybe a Tuesday yeah I was gonna say that Tuesday I might have something on day I could do Wednesday or Monday should we do Monday Monday yeah Monday is fine around three yeah three let me see let me no the 27th oh I'm gonna see if I can look at Carla and Zach's calendar to just to see what it looks like Carla is available let me see Zach quick it looks like Zach is available as well yep okay  Monday 27 at 9 AM. That's 3 PM.

31:05 - Bryan Yandun Beltran (Xeneta)
  9 10 11 12 12.

31:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK, then I will send a meeting right now from 3 to 4. Abby, can you just add? I'm sorry.  Zach's email, but I don't have Zach's email. Do that so I'll send that now so you have it. And then maybe we can set up.  Brian, should we set up like a shorter half hour sink to see like so we can prepare what is good for you like January 5th 13th?  Like what or like that or 6th or 13th out when it's good for you. 13th open.

31:40 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Yeah, yeah, me too. I would just say 13 because, you know, first week it's always. Yeah, like I could do 2 30 PM.  What time is that there?

31:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Or 8 30. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. OK, yeah, I'll put that in just more for us.

31:57 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  OK. Perfect then. Excellent.

32:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We look forward to talking in the new year. Yes, but enjoy your Halloween holidays then.

32:08 - Abbie Bergesen (Xeneta)

32:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, thank you.

32:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
