0:00 - Patricia Adena
  Am I pronouncing it correctly?

0:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, that's a very nice thing to say unless you have a cold at your nose.

0:13 - Patricia Adena
  It's good. It's good.

0:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you for asking. It's very kind. Yeah, sorry.

0:19 - Patricia Adena
  I had to reschedule last week because I forgot that it was a holiday weekend here. So I have it scheduled it today.  So thanks for...

0:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, actually, I think I reschedule it too. So maybe we reschedule it.

0:36 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I think you declined the meeting and then I also reschedule it since it's, I think, Friday whole week.  Oh, yeah, for sure.

0:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes, yes, True, to that. Yeah, I sometimes don't realize it's a holiday. Yeah, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank  How are you? How are you doing?

1:04 - Patricia Adena
  I'm doing good. I am very excited to do this call. I had to review or read our conversation. I do the same.  I'm very, very excited with what we could talk about. I know you are talking in the All In Summit.  It's a summit, right? Yeah, that's nice. I also follow those guys, those people on the list because they are also somehow offering the same service that I have.  So I kind of learned from them, from their content. And I think I also signed up in that event.  So I'm also looking forward to that. I think that's next month.

1:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think, you know, it's next week. It's next Thursday.

1:59 - Patricia Adena
  Next Thursday. Which is also the first day of the next month, yes, yes. Yeah.

2:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, you know, I'm excited to, I also reviewed our conversation, made some notes to make sure I didn't miss anything.  And that this agency world, I think that you're more experienced with the agency world than I am. From what I could see in your content, the things you share, it seems that you've been, you know, closer to this.  And also at the deeper level than I have. Because I come from, like, design, creative industries, so there's always, like, agencies around.  But I never really understood, like, how to run an agency. I don't have an agency. I don't want to have an agency.  But I think you know a lot about how agencies actually. Yeah.

2:52 - Patricia Adena
  I actually worked with a bunch of marketing people and then also then leads into agency. So I found gaps in their operations, like internal operations, like how projects are taken care of, how people are taken care of.  So those are like the problems or the gaps that I saw when I was working inside an agency. So I had to redo everything, like my office, what I do.  And yeah, I eventually, my partner and I are kind of working together now. So we want to go into the AI automation process.  Like, since I think that's the trend we're going, it's a good problem that we cannot escape. So we kind of had to just use it and not be scared of.  And I think it's, it's a great tool. So, but I think I'm not yet on that expert level that you're talking about.  I think the expert guys are. So yeah, I'm still learning. We're still starting out since we came from being a VA, like doing a bunch of things like creatives, admin, like as a VA, before I do everything.  So I'm expected to do everything. So we kind of shifted into one focus, a quick focus area, and that is operations and hopefully you'll get into AI and workflows automation in the near future.  are currently building it.

4:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I didn't stop to think about this, but it makes a lot of sense that AI, especially agents, are probably changing the VA market, right?  Yeah, yeah.

4:52 - Patricia Adena
  I think three years ago, it is still not a threat for VA, but now it's... It is considered kind of a threat, especially Chad CPT also launched the operator feature, so I think it removes the DVA trend, but it's still ongoing.  It's like for one client that I'm working with, they had to lay off some people, and then we are building the AI agents and then focusing more on automated workflows.  We had to redo everything so we also know who to hire. So, yeah, I think it's hard to deal with that and use it as a strength.  Yeah, it's not going back for sure. Yeah, especially I think every day there's a new trend going on, so it's hard to keep up.  It's very hard to keep up.

5:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was talking to someone, and I kind of tried to keep up on... So, level, I'd say. I was talking to someone yesterday.  She has a branding agency here in Brazil. And they're very small, very boutique, and they're really focused on the craft, right?  So she runs all the operations, and she likes doing that. I was not trying to get in on the operations.  We were talking about something else, but that's what she does. And she was telling me, like, yeah, I know I need to learn more about AI, but I don't know where to start.  I shouldn't procrastinate on that, but there's so much. And I think a lot of people are very overwhelmed with this.

6:43 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think that is where I want to come in. Because I mentioned on the conversation that we had that some agency owners, like, they know the importance of that, but they don't have the time.  And We want to focus on money-getting activities, so it's kind of going to the bottom-up tier to-do list, and then eventually it's the next tier, which is a lot, so I tried to keep up, but do you mainly work with agencies now, or mostly your network?

7:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm transitioning, so I'm starting to get more work from agencies, but historically, that's not where I get it. Historically, I think most of my work has come from my network and solos, independent consultants, but as a solo, I know that I'm a very difficult market to sell to, right?  All the solos, they're actually a B2C sale, right? solos, a B2C All the solos, It's different. So I'm trying to get into agencies.  And that's how I started to, you know, orbit the world of Chris Dubois. And so on. And, you know, something that I think was helpful for me, and maybe we're just, you know, sharing, talking shop.  Yeah. Something that I think was helpful for me was that, so workshops are a little bit, creating workshops is a little bit like creating an offer, right?

8:36 - Patricia Adena
  It's related.

8:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But at the same time, I feel that an offer is such a strategic thing. It really connects with everything else, right?  It's about branding, positioning, how you deliver on the offer. So operations, it's a whole thing. And I thought, if I start talking about offers, I'm really good at the workshop part.  But I'm not very good at the other part. And I think people will see me as a threat and will not want to collaborate.  They're like, yeah, nice, nice post. But they will not see me as a possible resource. So I've made myself small, I think kind of on purpose.  And maybe it's silly, maybe I'm just convincing myself. But I think that by being focused on the workshop thing, I've met other professionals that help with positioning.  And they're like, oh, I like your thing. And they don't feel threatened by it. So that was a good lesson, I think, from the last year that I got.  Yeah, yeah.

9:40 - Patricia Adena
  yeah, I mean, yeah, I think. So mainly you're transitioning into offering, like building their offers. Like we're talking about positioning, branding, right?  Am I getting that correctly? No, it's just like, it's like.

10:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Think about it this way. I can describe you with stories. There's a guy I was working with as a client, and this client is a marketing consultant, marketing expert.  And this guy, he has help for other things. So he has a guy that helps him with content, he has somebody that helps with operations, and so on.  At some point, this client of mine noticed that, you know, workshops, maybe I need a workshop, you know, but I don't know how to do a workshop.  Because a workshop, it's like the techniques of a workshop. They're not secrets, but they're just different from other things.  And it's not really a marketing agency kind of thing. It's not really a designer kind of thing. It's a mix of things.  So sometimes people understand, oh, I need to make a workshop, but they have no idea on how to do it.  get Let's For instance, if you're helping someone put together an offer, there's many parts to that offer, right? The workshop is just like the bit of the offer.  It's an interaction. It's a kind of a meeting, right? So that's where I focus on. So I don't focus on the other things.  I don't focus on the landing page. I don't focus on the messaging. So, yeah, that's it.

11:24 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I've read a blog. know you're familiar with that as well. With the, I think, Dotcom Secrets, emphasizing the importance of that.  Yeah, it's over there, I think.

11:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:40 - Patricia Adena
  I think that is one of the products that is not going anywhere, considering with the trends and AI that's been coming on recently.  So I think it's also very important. I think- I was on Facebook before, but it's kind of not how people market the services there.  So I think I switched to LinkedIn. That's where I noticed that events are kind of active in LinkedIn. So I'm kind of getting more into, yeah, I met a lot of people going through the events.  So yeah, I think what you're offering is very, very important as well, especially with more established agencies, especially with, for example, the summit that's been coming.  Do you also help with building that workshop?

12:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no. I'll just have a little slot to talk about.

12:58 - Patricia Adena
  So it's the first time.

13:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I didn't organize it. I could see there's a Slack group, and I can see a little bit of the work that Chris is putting into it, but I don't see much more of that.

13:14 - Patricia Adena
  No, I don't know. Yeah. Do you have any tips or ideas with building network since you just transitioned into helping agencies build their workshop, I also wanted to have more network that also into operations agencies, but I kind of find it hard to build relationships in LinkedIn since I think everyone receiving sales message every day from people.  So how do you break the wall in that?

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  much. . . I think that's a very flattering question. I'm not sure I'm very good at it, but I can tell you what I try to do.  So what I've started to do, and I'm not very disciplined at this, I'm sure you can find a way of doing this much better, is when I find people that I'm like, oh, I want to know this person.  So I start, I hit the bell, so I see every notification, right? And then I start to comment, but I really make an effort to comment something, and sometimes it takes a little bit of time, but I really make an effort to make a comment that adds to the conversation.  So, for instance, I think it's a mistake, in my opinion, right? It's just my opinion. I think it's a mistake to make comments that just confirm what the person said.  And when somebody says something really smart and says, oh my God, this was mind-blowing, that adds nothing to the conversation, and it looks like AI.

15:00 - Patricia Adena
  So it's the worst.

15:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It takes you actual time to do it, but people think you are AI. So it's the worst kind of bargain.  So I think, in my opinion, it's best if you comment with something that moves the discussion a little bit forward.  And the more I do it, the easier it gets, but still, sometimes I'm not sure. And another thing that I've noticed is that I used to try to come across, like, super professional.  But I'm kind of a funny guy. So I was like, maybe I should, you know, accept that and make sometimes sarcastic comments.  And sarcastic is a strong word, but like, you know, and I started to do that. And I think that what happened was, you know, some people started to be intrigued.  Right, right? So that's the thing. And another thing that I did, and this is very important, I should have started with this thing I'm going to say now.  So I set myself a challenge of posting every business day for a quarter, right? It was very annoying, and I knew that I would not get a lot of followers.  Because LinkedIn is, you know, the reach is very bad, and it's very frustrating. But I tried to take it as me learning how to talk about this thing, right?  And by forcing myself to do that, I think I've missed three days. By forcing myself to do that, there was a couple of things that happened.  So the first one was, I needed to find ways for having to create content quickly, right? So I created, like, Google Sheets with ideas, and...  Every now and then I would look at it. Whenever an idea comes up, I open the tab, I add to it.  So it started to become easier to find ways of talking about this. And so I got more comfortable with finding stuff to talk about.  I got more comfortable with finding ways of saying that stuff. And I started to experiment with formats, right? So because I come from design, it's easy for me to make posts on Figma and stuff like that.  Sometimes I think I waste too much time on that, but anyway. But I think it was really helpful in the sense that people sometimes say that my posts are too technical.  I've heard that. But it's funny because I've heard something like this. Look, your posts are very technical. I'm not sure I understand, but I can see that you know what you're talking about.  Which is interesting because if I were trying to make posts that everyone was like, yeah, nice, of course, you know.  Um, maybe I would get more reactions, but, uh, maybe people would not think that I have a fresh perspective on this.  So I think it's useful to try and, and, and go, it was, it was useful to me. It's just to, if I frame it this way, to try and really explain like deep differences between things.  I think that helps. Yeah.

18:28 - Patricia Adena
  It made me more confident talking about this stuff. Yeah. I, I also tried posting before, like I actually joined a accountability group just to post on LinkedIn.  So that's, I do it, I think for three months consistently. I tried to be consistent with that. Um, and then that's where I like somehow it gets, uh, natural.  Yeah. So after a few months, it's not a hard. But then kind of paused by now. I still find time and bring back the discipline that I built before.  So, and also going back to the comment strategy that we shared, I actually saw a post about that, like having a three point, one to three point of like your thoughts on the post and have a question at the end.  So that is what they are recommending on, like on how to comment, not just that's great, that's great. So I also, I also do that suggestion before, but I find it hard, like can be time consuming to absorb the post and then have it, have some thoughtful questions.  So, yeah, uh, I tried it, I think, for one week, but it gets harder with the, like, also doing some work.  And then, like, I think mainly the problem is, like, having that discipline into doing what you said in doing.  So, yeah, I think that is where I need to work on because I think I can do it, but not that consistently.  I think that's what I need to bring back. And then, yeah, go on. Sorry, I didn't want to. Please finish.  Sorry, sorry.

20:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I can continue.

20:50 - Patricia Adena
  No, okay. I apologize.

20:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Something came to me. So one thing that I think was very helpful, but I don't think it's super scary.  A level, but it's helpful, is that whenever I found, you know, interesting online, like what we're doing now, I said, hey, you would like to have a chat, right?  So in those chats, the chats that we're having right now, I try to share my vulnerabilities quickly. And this is not very strategic, it's more like it's easier for me, I mean, I live in Brazil, people in Brazil are very open about sharing this stuff, and I'm Portuguese, Portuguese are not like that, but Brazilians are, so I've lived here for a while, so I observed that.  And what I've noticed is that when we have this kind of first conversations, we get, you know, closer, of course, and then when I see you on the timeline, I will like, comment, repost, and the thing is, I think this really, I didn't plan for this, but I think it helps.  And I've had so many of these conversations with people around the world that no matter what time I post, there's a friend in that time zone.  And that person will make like a cool comment or they're not. Sometimes you can see like there's a guy specifically, Nick.  Nick is very nice. So every time I post, Nick is very, very supportive. John as well, John Norley. Like it doesn't matter where I post it.  They're like, yes, and they make good comments. And that thing, I think, acted as a way for me to enter different bubbles.  It was not on purpose. But my point is making like a friend on LinkedIn that then the person will react to your stuff.  Maybe it doesn't scale, but I think it allows for this.

22:49 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I think what people have been missing with the AI and automation thing that's been going on is the authenticity.  Yeah. I think people are craving for those kind of people and those kind of conversation. I think that's what sticks the most, that having a character that you could show on your posts or your messages that people could read.  So, yeah, I agree on that. And yeah, I'm actually evaluating, like I've been testing different message templates, like an intro message.  Like there are templates that have been working, but after a week, they're not working. So, and then I'll just try to just not having a template at all.  Like it's what comes into mind. But I think that is also couldn't be considered as scalable since we couldn't.  Have it AI, but I think that's more working, more personal. So, yeah, I think not everything could be automated and have an AI to focus on the process and then missing on doing and having more genuine conversations.

24:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I suspect that you are much more organized about outreach than I am. So I don't think I'm very good at commercial outreach.  I'm good at meeting cool people, but sometimes they'll not turn into clients. So, like when we started talking, you know, the messages, like your answers were very thoughtful.  Like you thought about this and that was clear in your answers. And... Like, the first message, I wasn't sure, like, is this a script?  Like, the first message.

25:10 - Patricia Adena
  But I was like, okay, let's try.

25:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we started talking, and then you reacted to it with your thoughts, and here we are. It's fun. So I think the script is always accelerating, right?  The more people use scripts, the shorter the scripts function, right? I mean, it's a month, it's a week, it's two days.

25:36 - Patricia Adena
  It's impossible to keep up.

25:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one of the things I've been trying to do, and I understand your point about being scalable. So I'm not super consistent about this.  I'm not consistent about anything. But I've been trying to make more videos, also because I have a weird name, and...  I'm not a native speaker, and I don't want people to realize that the first time they talk to me.  I want that when people talk to me, they've seen me talk somewhere, right? So I've been making a bit more videos in that sense so that people get a feeling of who I am.  Because the video conveys so much more, like your face, and now you move your hands. And so I think what I'm doing is I'm putting my personality into the videos so that when I need to send a message and the people check my profile, and there's still a lot of work to be done there, I don't need that message to be perfect.  It's just good enough for people to, oh, okay, yeah, you know? Yeah, it just speaks. Come again?

26:48 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I think it just speaks when you message someone, yeah. Yeah, I think that's good. Yeah, I have, I think, yeah, after...  I think I want to ditch the message, the templates, because when I was working, like doing outreach like that, we are trying to conserve time, like use the other time on other purpose, but it's actually doing great results.  So people can read templates, people can read scripts, so yeah, I think, but on the video part, I'm not very confident on like showing up through videos, but yeah, I think everything can be learned these days.

27:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, my wife, she does a lot of video, she works on a different thing, but she does a lot of video, she's like a keynote speaker, she's very comfortable with that stuff.  Yeah.

27:58 - Patricia Adena
  And she's been like...

28:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She festering me to do video for a long time. It's like, make videos. I don't know. I don't know what to say.  Make videos. And I'm like, yeah. And I had been really... I didn't want to do it. And then she installed CapCut on my phone because her phone was out of battery and she would use her account.  It was something like that. And then I recorded the silly video to talk about some whatever. And I was like, oh, this was very easy.  And I mean, I think I've now posted maybe five videos. And it's getting more natural. But at first, I felt icky about it.  Like, oh, I don't know.

28:46 - Patricia Adena
  Do I need to practice?

28:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the funny thing, I can use also the example of my wife. So she's a speaker. She's very good at talking.  She has been on television.

28:59 - Patricia Adena
  She... She... She's good at it.

29:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the funny thing is that clients are now asking her for more stuff that feels more natural. Yeah. Stuff that she doesn't go to a studio that she records at home.  And so I think that it's a good time for non-professionals to start talking and just, you know, be comfortable with it.  Because she's a professional, I'm not. And, you know, but I understand what you mean. It feels like a new thing and it's annoying.  Yeah, I get it.

29:30 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, yeah. I think at the end of the day, it still leads back us to authenticity. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and character.  Yeah, yeah.

29:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And even like when we mispronounce things.

29:45 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, yeah. Mispelling on the messages. Yeah, I think that adds more a person feeling. So, yeah, that's nice. I also try to do like voice notes.  Mm-hmm. What's your feeling about VoiceNotes?

30:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You are in the Philippines, right? Yeah, yeah.

30:08 - Patricia Adena
  I tried doing it as a strategy as well, knowing me I had to practice when I don't like what I say.  I had to repeat it. Mm-hmm. So I also find it still harder, but I think that's more I could consider as a first step into the video thing.  Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think that's what I want to do. Like, we build, my partner build that kind of strategy, but we are not practicing it because, yeah, confidence speaking is hard.  So I think that I could see there is a first step into going into speaking in videos.

30:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. You know, I asked what you thought about voice messages. Because here in Brazil, people use voice messages a lot.  I've noticed.

31:15 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I had a client before that was more sweet. For me, it's very annoying.

31:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It didn't send me a voice message. I'm just sharing my perspective. For me, it's very annoying because it makes me need to stop what I'm doing to listen to the voice message.  But the video is different because the video, at least I'm getting not just a note, but I get your sense.  So something, I don't know if this is good, but maybe it is. You know, Loom videos. Loom videos of their website, where their website or profile open, and you're like, oh, when you said this thing, it made me think of this thing that maybe you have trouble with this kind of, or Loom videos with their website, and then you shift a tab to your thing.  Slide of how you work. Because then we get the voice, we get you, and we get their context, right?  It's like a mini case study. And of course, and the Loom video is limited to five minutes. So, I mean, it gets done, it doesn't get done.  So eventually, you do it. I don't know. Actually, I might try to do this myself.

32:24 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I think personally, I don't like getting messages via voice notes. But if it works for other people, I talked to a prospect, I think, last week.  And he wants me to answer in a voice note just to see how's my English. Yeah, I think that that's funny.  But yeah, we

33:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what has been working the best for you in terms of finding clients? What's the thing that works the best for you?

33:30 - Patricia Adena
  I am focusing mainly on LinkedIn. I've been doing a bunch of Facebook groups, Facebook outreach, Instagram outreach. I also tried threads, but I find that also in demographic sense, I think Facebook more on women, Instagram also more on women, threads also more on women, agencies.  Then on LinkedIn, think I mainly connected with male agency owners. So I'm working with women-owned and male-owned agency. So I could see the difference with how they work.  And I actually had a preference more right now, like I'm more on LinkedIn, because I think the, like not to generalize, but I think male agency owners are more open into like faster conversation.  Decision-making is more fast. And then for, because I also work with women agencies before, I had to make it more pretty.  So I also had to do the designs. So I find it more easy to work with and also to talk with in terms of sales.  I find it easier to talk to on LinkedIn since people are more open in business conversations than on Facebook and Instagram because Facebook and Instagram, I think, is more personal page.  So I had to watch their personal life or react to their personal life just to have that connection between us.  And for LinkedIn, I find it easier to transition from the welcome message and then to actually inviting them into a call.  So I think LinkedIn is what's been working with me great. Great. Like I find good results. talk to. A bunch of people in here.  Yeah, I think these LinkedIn outreach contents and then, yeah, think LinkedIn more is where I get more clients.

36:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. No, no, this is good. This is good. I didn't think about the difference between male and female. Well, but yeah, I'm not crazy.  I think there are differences between men and women and people react in different ways. it makes sense to me.  Oh, so one of the things, this is a question, right? So one of the things that I've noticed with some of my clients is that, I don't know, do you have time?  Maybe you are a bit faster.

36:50 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah.

36:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One of the things that I've noticed with some of my clients is that some of them are like diagnosed ADHD.  noticed the things noticed with So So Yeah.

37:00 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah. I also noticed that.

  I've been curious to learn more specifically how to work with ADHD people. Like I am kind of ADHD myself.  And I'm like, if like 30% of my clients are ADHD, I should learn how to work with ADHD people.

37:24 - Patricia Adena
  Right. What do you think about this? Yeah. That's a good point. An interesting point that you just mentioned because what I noticed is like most of the clients that I work with needs help with organization.  Like getting their brain or getting their business structured in a way that's easy. So there are some people, like some clients that have an ADHD doesn't want to be visually structured.  So some others want to be very simple, like straightforward. Thank you. There's different kinds of clients that have an EDG.  also noticed that there are clients that doesn't respond after a week, and then they just brain dump everything in one day.  So those kind of clients that I worked with that I also experienced, what I'm doing is understand what kind of...  I don't know anything professionally about EDG, but I kind of get into the first step of getting to know them, how they work, how they communicate, how they want the message to be structured, or how they want the results to be structured, and like...  A bit customized to them. So what I added in my onboarding form is a very detailed form. The questions, how do you want to be communicated?  How do you want to structure your workspace? For example, ClickUp. We are building ClickUp. How do you want it to be structured?  you want to have more visually documented? What kind of notifications do you want to achieve? So those kind of details are, I think, very tiny details are important.  Mainly getting to know how they work and how they operate is mainly what I think is working on. Awesome.  Yeah, think also adding doesn't take or don't take anything personal for people with ADHD as they sometimes ignore you for a couple of days and have everything on a day.  So yeah, those kinds of things I noticed with clients that have an ADHD.

  So that's interesting. So yeah, you're much ahead of me on this. Because for me, it was just like, what?  I think, so we both serve experts, right? And I think experts are often very curious. That's how you become an expert.  Yeah. And I think curiosity is sometimes related to that kind of thing. So So I think the approach I've been taking has been more like super specific kind of instructions, like, oh, we're going to do this thing and then this thing.  But some people don't like very specific, so right now I don't have answers for this. I'm just, you know, trying to pick up tips along the way on all towards life best with this kind of clients.  Thank you. I...

  I have one more thing to add about that. talked to a prospect before that she's an extreme. She said that she has an extreme ADHD and she needs everything in a list.  Like right off her face on a list that she needs to check or that she needs to follow on a daily basis.  Yeah. Business or personal things. I have the same thing. So... But... Thank So yeah, we had to talk about that and how we could structure it in a way that's working for her.  And then she also mentioned that she also gets disrupted very easily. So she has an app, like a to-do app, that has notifications about stuff like that.  So I think it depends on the level. think what's very important is knowing, personally knowing yourself. On how you operate, how you want to.  Because there are different, there's different tactics for everything. There's a different, people suggest this one is working, this one is working.  So yeah, I think it's what also works is knowing. Truly what works for you and your style.

43:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, for sure, for sure. It's useful to be aware of the types. And there was a guy, yeah, I'll just wrap it up.  There was a guy I was working with, and at some point he was like, so what's your Enneagram? And I don't know, I went to check, and apparently we had a very similar Enneagram, like almost the same.  And that was very interesting, because then we could use that to know. I remember going on ChatGPT, like, I need to say this to this person, and they are this profile.  What's the best way of saying this? And ChatGPT was like, oh, maybe you can go this. Ah, okay. That's not the way I would do it, but it is interesting, and I've used that.  So yeah, I agree with you, like, just figuring out what works for them and what we can do that fits that.

43:56 - Patricia Adena
  Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I agree. I think this is a great call. I'll try to create a post. If it's alright for you, I'll tag you.  Sure, sure. Anyway, it's... have it ready maybe this week. And yeah, it's very interesting. We have gathered so many topics and...  Yeah, it was a good conversation. Thank you. Thank you, João. I'm looking forward to your content. And I'll try to engage as much as I can.  likewise. Don't worry.
