0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, good. You're hearing me well, right? What time is it there?

0:06 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  It is four in the... The afternoon.

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay. So it's five years. We're close. Oh, no.

0:15 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I forgot about the... You're further ahead.

0:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but I mean, I don't stop working at five, not as a solo. okay. Okay.

0:27 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So nice to meet you.

0:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thanks for reading up.

0:32 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, I saw we have some mutuals. Is that how you came across my post, do you think? I think so.

0:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've been intentional about that, but I think so. And I remember that, you know, the whole brief paper thing speaks to me.  I think you can probably tell. And this... I love the quirky Science Museum vibe, and I think that your website, your new brand, did a little bit of that.  And then I was reading through your description and your background, creative and engineering parents, and I was like, okay, yeah, I can see that.  So, yeah, I think that's what made me feel that we would probably get along, and I like their perspective.  Nice.

1:31 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, I'm glad to hear it. Tell me about your business. Sure.

1:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, without getting into pitching mode or anything, basically, I share something that you also care about, which is the bridging and the translating thing.  And when I look at my career, I've always been doing that kind of thing. I've worked as a product manager.  you, sir. I worked as a consultant with the workshop things, so there's always this kind of work that you know exactly what I mean, and I really, really like, and I don't know, I really enjoy talking to really experienced, smart, you know, creative people, and I was like, I need to get a job, you know, increasing my surface area for this kind of conversation, and I was like, what do I do that fits this?  And I was like, I think it's the workshops, because I've been doing workshops and creating workshops for people initially at my job, like some workshops for specific situations, and then I merged that into the product management perspective, which is like, oh, the workshop is a product, and should be thought as something in your portfolio, something that has to be tested, iterated, go to market, and so on.  So I was like, okay, yeah, I think this is it. And, you know, then... I came, and I think my conviction actually increased, because, actually conviction is a big word here, because, you know, getting access to knowledge is free and instant now, but it's very difficult to make serious decisions based on what CHPT told you, right?  Yeah. And then it gets stuck, like, oh yeah, I don't need to hire you guys, I just asked CHPT.  Okay, so now we need to spend this amount of money to put that strategy that CHPT gave you in motion.  Like, yeah, I'm not sure, I'll ask again, right? So I think that we are not there yet, but more people will come to realize that, you know, conviction is really important, and part of the friction of the process, when compared to just asking things to a computer, leads to conviction.  And I think workshops are a sandbox in which you put those interactions, because a lot of people don't know how to have those conversations, they intuitively get it, but they don't have the repertoire to...  Keep doing it. Manage those conversations. That's my thesis. How about you? No, totally agree.

4:07 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  You have to make sense of the information to actually do stuff with it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it needs to percolate, right? It's not just like, oh, it's really well-written because ChatGPT is trained on copywriters, right?  But it's trained on being persuasive, and you're like, oh, great insight. But then you change tabs, and there's another great insight, and it just doesn't go through.  Sometimes I forget this as well, and I do my own deep research mode, and I get pages and pages of reports for my own market.  I'm like, yes, this makes sense, but there's a nuance that I only get when I interview people. Yeah, oh, for sure.

4:54 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So, okay, I ask this not out of skepticism, but, like, admiration.

4:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

5:00 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Like, how's business?

5:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could be better, for sure. I think the pause was a very pregnant pause. be better, for sure. And I think it's very ironic that I think one of the things that is holding me back a little bit is precisely explaining what I did.  And, you know, there's all those metaphors, like, you cannot read the label from inside the jar, and so on.  And now, looking back, when I look back at my content, like, older content, I can really see that, because I didn't have a lot of experience with content.  I had experience with takes. I have takes on things, but not content. That's a different thing, right? Mm-hmm. And looking back, I'm like, oh, I was, you know, filling up the bingo card of mistakes around content.  Tell people about the thing that I know, don't talk about their problems, know, be too complex, try to be clever, you know, all these kind of things.  I still do them, and I still find myself doing it. And so to your point about the business, what I've been noticing is this.  Some people get really interested, like intrigued, like what I feel that you are right now, like, oh, there's something here.  But it's still not landing at the speed or at the volume that I would like, of course, right? And then you have all these, you know, hiccups of being, you know, an overthinking person and shiny object and so How about you?

6:55 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, same. I mean, it's definitely been. It's gone surprisingly well, would say, better than I ever thought. I have, you may have seen it in my post, though, decided to only just be disciplined about working with startups because, yeah, I've done some work with agencies, consultants, etc., and I love them, right, like, that's, like, kind of where my heart is, but they usually have less to spend, and then I've found that they have more to learn in terms of, like, the basics of, like, pack, you know, packaging up content in, like, a sales-oriented way, and so the margin just doesn't really work out.  However, I am, like, you know, a service like yours is, like, how you make the margin. Right. Like there needs to be more something more repeatable.  That's like, yeah, like less hands on, easier to kind of just like, you know, something you could like actually run an ad for and get a conversion off of reasonably instead of like my process is.  Yeah, it's like pretty, I would say, informal, which, yeah, I don't necessarily like, I guess I'm okay for now with that.  And like, just use, you know, having a clientele that is more okay with that because they kind of get it.  But, yeah, I mean, I'd love to hear about your, your, yeah, your process. How, like, what?

8:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's, um, no, I can really relate to what you're saying. I think pretty much everything you just said. And I was just now, like, really, literally, like, five minutes ago, I was listening to one of the podcasts from the guys from Fletch, Fletch PML, about how Fletch PML came to be.  So it was not about positioning, it was about the history of the company. I'll send it to you. Yeah.  And earlier today, I was listening to another podcast about the story of Strategizer, the guys from the Business Mobile Canvas.  So I really, really like the metagame of, you know, turning expertise into products and processes and stuff. And, like, in my case, I also feel a bit of the Cobbler's son as no shoes, because I don't have a workshop that makes workshops, right?  I do have a process, and the process has bits of it that are workshops. But I think part of my, I'm dealing with this better now, because I used to feel like, oh, I need to have a workshop of making.  you. Thank Workshop, and then I kind of made peace with that because to make a car, you make the same, you make it in a factory, but to make a factory, you don't have a factory factory, right?  So, and I've noticed that I was being too strict about my ideas around productization and like how much of a on-rails experience it is.  So I'm more flexible around that. But what I've, the way I approach it is, and I've learned this kind of the hard way, is people need to have actual experience doing things.  So if someone comes and says, oh, I want to run a workshop for an AI thing. Okay. Have you done AI things?  No. We can't do the workshop. Yeah, for sure. But sometimes, and sometimes people come really at the early stages of, you know, going out on their own and getting their consulting going on.  They want the method. And I think it makes sense to aim for that. But it does happen that people arrive too early.  They haven't run it enough times to know where the kinks in the system are. And if you crystallize it into a workshop too soon, it's very easy to just go invest a lot of time and money and then maybe it's not the thing you need.  And I feel this myself, of course, because I'm like, so what's my process? What's my process? What's my process?  What's my canvas? I don't have a canvas. I've tried new things. So basically the main thing is that it needs to stem from actual expertise, not the desire to enter a new thing.  And also a lot about make the whole thing, the workshop. The workshop is a touchpoint. It's a high bandwidth touchpoint.  But you have other things, other communication that you do. But then when you are actually talking to people, course,  On the workshop and collaborating, you make the most use of that, and there's ways of doing that in the way you choose the exercises and you connect one activity to the next, or you close the workshop so that you increase the likelihood that people will apply these things and get success from working with you.  And there's also always a preoccupation about the symbolic aspects of, like, for instance, when you're working with a client, I don't know if you do this, but let's imagine that, do you think out loud sometimes, do you ad lib, like, we could go this way, we could go this way, do you do that?

12:40 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I mean, I do it, I don't do it naturally, I've, like, you know, learned to do more of that.  It doesn't come naturally, like, I, yeah, I have, like, I have to be like, oh, okay, I have to.

12:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I do it, I think I do it too much, to the point that I think it sometimes tanks a little.  So I think I'm on the other extreme. I see. You can see that in this conversation, being very candid.  Oh, totally.

13:12 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, I'm the same way. I mean, I totally get it. This stuff is hard. Well, I was honestly asking about your process more.  Yeah, I feel like we could be partners to each other, both formally and informally. But also, I feel like I could be a client of yours someday.  What you said about the kind of not necessarily being ready, I'm like, oh, maybe that's me. What kind of questions would you ask a potential client to know if they're ready for your services?

13:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So how many times you've run the same sort of process before? And there's So an aspect around client qualification, like what kind of client?  Do you have like a way of guaranteeing that you get kind of the same sort of clients in? Because the workshop needs to relate to that audience, and if the clients that come in are too varied, you need to adjust many things.

14:21 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Okay, so you're like really mainly focused on workshops right now.

14:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, yeah, that's a thing. I think workshops are like a deliverable that people can understand. But I think it's a little bit broader than that, but I try not to get too, you know, exoteric about it.  But it is about packaging expertise into an experience, basically, like games, and I've made stuff like that.

14:58 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I think I had my work. Fathom would be like how to create your first landing page as like a service provider.

15:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I show you something? Yeah. Okay, so this will be in Portuguese, but I'll translate. It's a mirror board, and I've done it a few times, kind of testing it, but then I've noticed that it wouldn't make sense for me.  I think that's it. Do you see my screen? I'm not sharing it yet. Okay, so I'll zoom out and give you a bit of an overview, right?  So this was a workshop format I've created because I took a coaching course. A lot of people taking coaching courses.  It was a good one. was not like snake oil, snake oil. So it was filled with like very, you know, a lot of people that really cared and suffered with imposter syndrome.  Like they really, they felt the calling to coaching, they liked to do this kind of thing, but they also were very hard on themselves, right?  And a lot of them were voicing the thing that, oh, I need to create more content, but I don't know how to do it.  Here in Brazil, Instagram is the biggest work by far, right? It's huge. And it's also difficult to get the attention there because, you know, you're competing with people that, you know, so good at, because we were talking about like maybe 40 year old people, they quit corporate, they've created an Instagram account, their first post is, yes, we're happy to be providing coaching services, calls if he needs, you know, this kind of thing.  And kind of intuitively, I was like, I think there's Way of helping these people, you know, break through that.  So I put together like a workshop format and I tested it with some people. And I was like, I think there's something in here, but I don't want to do the client acquisition for content work because that's not what I want to do.  I want to just create a workshop. So let me show you the basic structure. So you've seen Miro and stuff like this?  Yes, yes. Okay, cool. So it starts and I get some, it's very basic, like the exercise are not complex.  Because I want people to be able to do things, right? So it starts with the history of their careers, things they studied, things they did, things that they got accolades for, things they did not like to do, right?  So we did that. And then people always have that opportunity of, you know, kind of bragging a little bit.  Like here in Brazil, it's a big deal to have worked for a multinational. It's like an aspirational thing, especially for a certain generation.  So they always mentioned that, oh, I worked at a multinational, and maybe it was like a toilet paper multinational, but it was like a big deal, and some people always like to vent that because it's important for their story.  So it starts with their story, right? And then I asked them, what kind of themes are easy for you to talk about?  And there's some hints, but this is hidden. Only if they're stuck, I show these bits, you know? And people often start with their passions, like, oh, I really like green architecture.  don't know, but they're not trying to work with green architecture. They just, so we just let them put out these themes, right?  It was a two-session thing. And then there's kind of a, it's a bit of a quiz, so you would score these things in between, you know, the two extremes.  But there's no right and Wrong. And there's no middle ground. So it really forces them to make a decision like, oh, I believe in this.  Right. So I'm going to give you a few examples. What do you prefer? Right. What matters the most to you?  I like to depend or rely only on myself or I would like to bring others along with me. And then people have to make a decision because there's no middle.  Right. And I'm interested in getting respect from experts or I want everyone to accept me and everyone on this, you know, and so we do that.  And then I asked, so when it's time to create content online, what's the hardest thing for you? And a lot of people were like, I don't know what to say.  I feel scared that other experts will see the mistakes of the things that I say or no one will see it.  I don't like cameras because of the Instagram thing. They don't want to show up. I don't know how to use Canva, stuff like this.  And then we prioritize that. Out of all of these things, which three things are the hardest, and they just drag votes into it, right?  So Miro has a lot more tools than this, but I try to keep it in this way. It's just easier to run.  And that's it. That's the end of the first session. And I asked them a couple of what was good about it, what was a little bit of opportunity, and what some suggestions they have for the exercise, for the workshop, right?  Anyway, so they get, you know, and at the end, everyone was like, okay, this is good. It's impossible that they fail this exercise because they're just talking about themselves, right?  And sometimes people, I don't think that, I don't assume that your startup clients have this, but in my case, these people often had this, like, self-doubt, they weren't sure of themselves, they were scared about, you know, going out on their own, so confidence was a thing.  So we did the first thing. Is this tracking so far makes sense? Yeah, yeah. I don't know if I'm being too detailed.  No.

21:08 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  No, is helpful to both understand more of how you work and it makes me think about my own work.  Cool.

21:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then, this was a thing that was my theory on the whole content aspect. Later on, I kind of paid less attention to it because it was not very good or not very speculative.  So are you familiar with that book, The Tower and the Square? I think it's from 2008. No. So I think I didn't read the book, but I think it's about when Facebook came up around that time.  Remember, everybody loved Facebook at that time. Because, oh, it's a new town square. People can meet. at it than any.  Exchange information and so on. And they were comparing it in the book with, I think, what's the Italian city, Romeo and Juliet, Verona, where the families were competing with the towers, right?  There's fortress towers things. And the metaphor was like a tower is for broadcasting. You go up the tower and you shout to everyone, right?  But a square is meeting and bartering and trading and so on. And Facebook was creating town squares, democratizing access to information, right?  And what I said was like, you probably have like an image of how you need to be present on the internet that's either along the tower or the square thing.  And these things have like different advantages and disadvantages. Like people that want to be on the tower, they want to have an audience, but they should be ready to spend a long time, you know.  Sending that tower and getting no feedback, no one cares. You need to be motivated in a specific way to do that.  And the thing is, if you're arriving at this content thing from the outside, you don't know anything about marketing, you just need to do it, you don't even notice that there's other ways of playing the game.  You just see what the bigger accounts are doing, and you think you need to do the same thing that the bigger accounts are doing, right?  Yeah. And the bigger accounts are usually towers, because they broadcast for other people. And so that feels discouraging. And then I was like, there's another way, it's a square.  You connect people, you talk to people, in your content, you try to generate a discussion that pulls other people in, a discussion about your industry, about the things that you're seeing, and so on.  But even this was too social for some people. And I said, maybe there's a third space, and actually, third space, which is a library, right?  You are a researcher, and you are deep in the town. are deep Thank Archives, looking for things and coming up with theories, know this, you're probably not so affected with lack of feedback and putting in an audience, and maybe you care more about the quality of the things that you do, but that's a way of eventually you come out of the library with a big discovery and people appreciate that, the quality of that and the depth of that thinking.  To be honest, I don't think this works, right? Because if you pop up every now and then and there's no audience to see your amazing idea, so I have abandoned this.

24:37 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I actually agree, though. I would put a different spin on it, but I Tell me more. I was going to say, and this slide really affirmed it, I think you would really like or find use, but also inspiration or competition.  energy from a consultant called Michelle Warner. I never heard. Let me see. She's not well known. She's like a very, you know, sleepy, like, trying to build just like a tiny little, I think she actually says like helping people build tiny businesses.  But she talks about traffic versus relationship marketing and aligning your customers and product to to the right strategy, you know, like one could influence the other, but you can have them out of alignment.  But yeah, looking at this, I think it introduced like her her thing would be tower would be traffic marketing, and then square would be relationship marketing.  But I think library is like bringing in the lever of like curation.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you.

26:00 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  As a tool, yeah, so, and I do think curation is, like, a great stepping stone to, like, I mean, really just all content IMO, right, is, like, curate, like, different levels of, like, sharing other references, right, like, so, yeah, I don't, I think there's something to this.

26:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, feel that, so, thank you for saying that, thank you for introducing me to Michelle, I didn't know, but a quick pic made sense to me.  I also think that, in a sense, I love this kind of discussion, but for them, this was a bit like, oh, this seems clever, but I'm not sure, it was kind of, it was creating a friction point, in a sense, you know, and it was not, I wasn't as good.

26:57 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, I guess I can, what you're saying, where. If you're just starting out as a coach, it's less like, choose among these options, and it's more like, you have to talk, like, you have to do the relational work of building an audience.

27:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, that's just the only answer.

27:15 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So, yeah, I can see that. Yeah.

27:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the purpose of this section, just to, you know, cap it, but the purpose of this section was, like, to blend the idea that maybe you're comparing yourself to, like, a huge celebrity.  And that's not how you should be online. Yeah. There's another playbook for that. There's other playbooks. So, yeah, so this was, like, the first session, and there's, like, homework, and I tell them what to do, like, save this Miro session on your bookmark, so bookmark it, so you remember to come back to it.  Put it on your agenda the moment you'll do the reflection, and then the exercise, which is, like, make three lists of things that you would like to talk about.  It's a very simple, low-lived kind of thing. And then there's the second session. And the second session, I'll try to move a little bit quicker, but there's a recap.  And we just bring the stuff from the other session, right? And so these are the themes that they find interesting.  These are the things where they want to get to. These are some obstacles that they that they're facing, like I don't want to be on camera or stuff like that.  And these like ways of being online, which is related to the tower and the square and so on. So you go around the obstacles because you choose a different game to play.  I think that's the mechanics of it, right? So then there's like a more technical thing, which was about converting ideas into post ideas, right?  At this stage, I think Fathom was not, it was available, but it wasn't like as prevalent as it is today.  So I think now this is actually another parenthesis. In our conversation, which is, I think, workshops, they need to output things that you can upload to LLMs and keep the work happening.  And I'm thinking about ways of doing that, and I think I have some ideas. Because people will use LLMs, so if we just assume that they will use the outputs of our work, and we shape them like an API to interact better with an LLM, right?  I think that's probably at least an interesting rabbit hole to dive into. So they would, you know, put the theme here and then break it apart into other themes.  And then I gave them some ideas on how to approach this, right? And this is like Justin Welsh kind of thing.  Like, oh, you can do present and the future, or you can do motivational stuff, you can make, can be contrarian.  And, you know... And... And there's different channels of distribution, there's different media formats, know, stuff like this, that for them was useful, and for me was good enough as well.  So this was just to show them, like, don't worry, you'll have a lot of ways that you can do this.  There's a lot of space to navigate this. So we did the second round, and I think this was important, because if I showed this stuff before telling them to break their themes into posts, it would be overwhelming.  So we just asked them to do this, we introduced new information, and we gave them a second opportunity to do it again.  And they did it again, and then I gave them, like, a survival kit, right? Because my assumption is, during the workshop, people are pumped up.  Like, if we did our job well, people are pumped up. That's the easy part. After the workshop, there's an off-life to this enthusiasm, right?  very And we need to account for that, otherwise, you know, people just don't do the work, and eventually they'll come to realize that, yeah, it was nice talking to you, the workshop was cool, but they didn't get value out of it, which is not what you want.  And it was one of the things that the coaching teacher told all of us, like, if you're training to be coaches, be serious about people actually making the changes, otherwise they'll just have the nice memory of, you know, talking to you or a person that is trained on how to listen.  Everyone likes that. But if they don't see the impact, they're like, yeah, do I recommend? No. So here, this is a survival kit.  And this was the confidence-inducing thing for when they left the workshop, right? So let me explain to you kind of what it is.  So I said, now you have sources of clarity on what to do, and these are your themes, the way you are online, and your ideas for posts.  You have sources of confidence. In yourself, because all of this is based on your history. None of this is imposter stuff.  You also know how you'll go around the obstacles, and you have dedicated time to think about this in a structured way.  So when the doubt comes, think about this stuff, because it will make it easier. And you also have sources of courage.  I like alliteration, right? So clarity, confidence, courage, which are like your motives and the reasons you're doing this. And you are aware of the obstacles you'll find.  For me, this is really powerful. If you know that something is going to be difficult, when it gets difficult, you can say, hello, darkness, my old friend, is not a surprise and tends to make things simpler, right?  And then there was an invitation to them and an exercise. So the thing at the top was filled by me.  And this was asking them to try to do the same thing themselves, right? Which is important, because then they really reflect on it, and they're like, okay, yeah, I get it.  I really understand this source of courage I'm listening now, right? And so the homework was, again, just to plan the posts and actually put a few out of the door.  And this was V2, V1 was much more complex, and actually people got lost in the V1. And the final thing, I promised I would be short that I don't think I could do it, but the final thing was a bingo, and I really like this mechanic.  So the point is, as an expert, you kind of know the sort of troubles they'll find, right? You know this.  You might not know exactly the order, maybe they won't get all of them, but you can guess what kind of things will happen.  So you claim that, and you say, these are some things that might happen after this workshop, and you can just, you know, mark them.  Yeah, I love that. Yeah, so people are like, oh, I took three hours to create a post. Yeah, far from the course.  Welcome to the game. Or I hired someone to just do posts for me, but I don't like the posts that they made.  And yeah, a lot of people make that mistake as well. So the whole idea was to frame the capacity for forecasting as like, oh, João knows this, because this stuff didn't happen yet.  But when it happens, like, oh, he called it. So that was the mechanic I was trying to force with this workshop structure.  Anyway, sorry, I spoke quite a bit. No, that like, yeah, I love it.

34:47 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  It's inspiring. So, like, what kind of clientele do you do this for most?

34:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, consultants mostly. Right now, it's mostly solos, but I think I need a different product ladder for solos because it's what you said about consultants, like fascinating conversations, but so varied, right?  People come in different shapes and sizes, and they have all these different expectations. So I'm working with solos because it's people that are finding me, but I'd like to get something a bit more specific.  And right now, my hypothesis is boutique consulting firms that have bets hard on being technical experts, and now they need to shift.  To lean harder into the actual transformation, because access to expertise is free and instant, right? But there's a new vocabulary of interactions that they need to find.  I think it makes sense. I'm still learning how to do it. Not the technical thing, but how to sell it, which is so ironic.  For Yeah.

36:11 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Do you have a channel? I don't know. Do you have a BD strategy, I guess?

36:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A BD strategy is kind of a big name for it, but I posted LinkedIn and I have a newsletter and I've started to join agency groups, like Slack groups, just to get into that world.  I was exploring for a while the branding people because, you know, branding people always complain that people don't get what they do.  Yeah. They don't help themselves too much, but that's another thing. I would have to agree with that too. Yeah.  But what I've noticed is that... So I didn't get a lot of signal from the probes I sent into my network, like, hey, I'm doing this about ROI of branding, and this is my theory on that, and our workshop could look for that.  So I didn't get a lot of signal on that. I'm trying to be disciplined about this because I spent quite a bit of time kind of experimenting.  Because the ideas come easy, right? That's the first. So BDE right now is not very structured. I'm trying to get into as many conversations as I can.  Yeah.

37:36 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Have you found that the expertise buzzword, do you feel like that's gotten you good ROI? No. No.

37:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it attracts people like us. Fish. Thank People like the concept of expertise and want to be near it, but I think the people that have the money to pay for this, they have a much more dispassionate relationship to it.  So, have you read The Business of Expertise, the book? No, my gosh. It's really good. Have you heard of it?  No. I think you'll like it, I think you'll like it. Because it's written by a guy, David C. Baker, he has other books on the topic.  It's a nice rabbit hole. They have a podcast. And so, it's his certified Mensa is really clever and he knows how it feels to be pulled into all the directions and be very curious and like, oh, I'm this unique snowflake of interests and curiosities and the guy flies helicopters and races motorbikes.  But, what he says is... Make Private life so interesting that you don't seek novelty as much in your professional life, because that's what experts do.  They're very curious people. That's how become an expert. And for me, this insight was like, oh, he gets me, right?  And he's proud. So the book is really useful, I think, in many ways, in terms of positioning expertise. I think you might like it.  Yeah, totally.

39:27 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I definitely have been experiencing the, like, things taking the pressure off of my professional life and my personal life to make it be able to be more focused.  So being conscious of time, it's like, okay, you... I have time, so...

39:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay.

39:59 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  You, sir... Your output is, like, an interactive workshop. My output is content. So there's, like, you know, ways we could help each other internally, but also ways we could, like, partner up externally.  I don't know if you're, like, interested in that, right?

40:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am. I am. Okay. I love the idea of, you know, doing, like, features, like, as a song, like, featuring, you know.  So I like that. And I was thinking about that early today, that I'm open to collaborating. I think there's cool things we could do.  Part of the joys of this thing is do cool stuff with cool people. Yeah, that's kind of my only thing is we would need to frame it in the way that we actually ship something guilty as charged.  mean, many times I'm like, yeah, for sure. Let's do something. And then we do the busy work, but then we don't finish it.  And that, yeah, I wouldn't like to avoid that. Yeah, that's my only. Okay.

41:24 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Well, I think my angle would be like, we need to figure out what's most value add for like the least work.  I guess what, like, what would you say your most successful client has been? Like they're using your workshop the most or to get the most sales.  Okay.

41:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're about to get. Classified information, right? So the story of how I've noticed that I was good at this is that my wife has a consulting company.  And I was like, on corporate compliance, not the funniest of things, right? And I was like, you know what, I think that's like a workshop thing.  And we started doing workshops, right? And she got into the corporate compliance industry. She started basically solo. She didn't have a background.  She took courses for it. She was not a lawyer. She's not a lawyer. And in like in seven years, she was elected for straight years as one of the top references in compliance in Brazil, which has like a huge market for this kind of thing.  She's very good. think she's, I mean, it is not my merit. But the point is, she started to apply these more collaborative, participatory, interactive things into compliance work to bring people on board.  And then people are like, oh, we want her because she doesn't come and give us training. She involves us into the creation of, I don't know, codes of conduct, new rules, mapping out the risks, and stuff like this becomes more strategic.  So I think that's, it's so ironic because it's a great case, but I don't think it does me any favors because she's my wife.  And, but that's like the biggest example. I see.

43:27 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So you say, you're saying from like a marketing perspective, you can't be like, look at what I did for my wife.  So, um, and that, so those were used for, I guess it makes like, tell me about where in the sales or like upsell process she uses the workshops.

43:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. Okay. So this is, this is also useful intel for the question. She doesn't really use it as a sales mechanism, right?  uses it as as the. Product she delivers. She has other ways of acquiring clients. And now there's some velocity in the flywheel and referrals and so on.  But she doesn't really use the workshops in that sense. Okay, so that's what she's selling.

44:21 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  The product is the workshop, and that's fascinating.

44:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, she has multiple workshops. So basically, workshops are her way of doing things. She has several kinds of workshops.  And the way she introduces that is that she just stands out from the boring guys with slides reading from the slides.  It's like it's fish in a barrel in that sense. And now the market is getting a little bit more, it's getting smarter about this, right?  But she also, she's a very good communicator. She's been on television, stuff like that. So it's not only the workshops.  workshops. It's But I think the whole you can do things with people instead of just telling people to do things was very important for her to stand out.

45:10 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I think that's like, I didn't realize that that, I feel like I like that positioning for your work of like, we turn consulting into like, I mean, I guess a good consultant.  It's already doing this, but like, you know, we co-create, like we make it a partnership versus like a, you know, one way.  I guess, yeah, what are other areas of technical expertise where that's prone to happen? Where it's like, because I think I'd be willing to say every, anything technical is going to be better.  Implemented, if it is like a true partnership, like collaborative.

46:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. And that's the cool thing about workshops. the whole idea of workshops appeared around the 50s when people were dealing with cybernetics.  And now they were different, like at university labs and computer labs and stuff like that. And now the ways to handle complexity needed to be different because it was not very deterministic.  And, you know, you couldn't just keep it in one person's mind. You needed to collaborate in other ways. So these things started to be invented to deal with the complexity that at that time was the bleeding edge.  But today is every day. So that's where you come from. I mean, maybe invented is too strong of a word, but like that's how the corporate world started to get.  So first the academic world to address this kind of problems. And then that bleeds out into the corporate world.  The UX professional also did. That's because, you know, interacting with new systems and ways of putting services together, and that needed to create the language for that, and that's how kind of workshops became a thing.  So I agree. I think everything that's technical, and are you familiar with Cunevin? I think it's written like, okay, it's really interesting.  think you'll like this, because it's not written the way it sounds, because it's a Welsh word, I think. So, the kind of problem-solving approach you should follow depends on what kind of environment you are in, right?  And Cunevin suggests, I don't remember exactly the order, but like, in some circumstances, you are in an ordered environment.  You know what's going to happen. For that, you follow best practices. And then you have a complicated environment. Loads of things, but of the same kind.  Best practices don't really apply in the same way. You need something else, right? And then you have the, so complicated, then you have the complex, many different things of many different kinds.  Best practices do not apply. That's not how you address these things, right? And finally, you have the chaotic, which, and this is related also to the familiarity with the context.  If you're solving a new problem that no one has solved before, if you come into that with the best practices, you're not going to solve it, right?  That's not going to happen. Why am I talking about this? I think because the world is moving so fast, the surface area, again, that metaphor of chaotic problems is becoming more apparent, but people don't have the tools to, you know, operate in these environments.  And this is why, like, agile, and Agile and so on, you know, came up. It's related to this sort of things, like operating under uncertainty.  But I think Agile got a little bit burned in terms of like a collective consciousness. But the principles make sense for that kind of work.  It's just the branding got burned by, you know, rebuilt work and so on. Sure. But I don't know. Does this connect?  Yeah, totally.

49:26 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, it's your this part of our conversation is making me think about like, I feel like I know I've met other people who would be like, interested in what you have to say, but from like a peer, you know, peer perspective.  And it's making me think of, I don't know. Yeah, I feel like we're going to have to like, I hope you don't.

49:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll have more conversations for sure. yeah, yeah.

49:56 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I'm like, I'm also very anti like. Not shipping, but I'm also, like, I feel like it's going to take, at least for me, to, like, wrap my head around, like, what we could do.  I guess maybe last question on this for now is, like, what problem was your wife facing that the workshops helped with?

50:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, good one. So the first workshop we did, it was about mapping risks, because the whole theory of corporate compliance is that you need to start from the risk profile.  You should not just copy a code of conduct from the internet. You should understand how your company operates, which risks exist, and then you create the rules to, you know, address those risks.  So that was the risk first thing. Risk is contextual. So... So she needed to know what the risks are.  And because of hierarchy, the leaders don't know where the risks are. The frontline does. So you need to involve the frontline and they will tell you what the risks are.  And so this was kind of the thing. She was like, I need to understand what the risks are. So I need to ask people.  I don't want to interview all these people. I'll just put them together in a room and we'll find a way to guide their collaboration to get there.  Okay.

51:28 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So the clients, her clients, they're hiring her because they simply don't have the internal expertise? At that stage, yes.

51:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And right now, but at that stage it was that. And now she's kind of moving into this trusted advisor position where people come to her with like fuzzy problems.  So it still happens that people call her and say, hey, we need a keynote presentation, we need some training sessions, we need this and that, we need a new code of conduct.  That still happens. But because she has proven that she can think in unstructured environments, people come to her and say, you know what, I don't know how to think about this.  What do you think about this? And that's not really workshops. And sometimes it's just conversation and sometimes she will say, you what, let's put together a workshop for that and we'll design one.  But I think at the start, firms, and this is a big point, at the start, the firms did not want a workshop.  They don't have the language to ask for this. They don't know this. But they trusted her when she said, you know what, we need to figure out the risks.  It's important because it affects everything else.

52:48 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  That's making me think, like, I think part of my, like, I'm like, uh, is, like, the advice. Like the strategic advisor level of like work, I'm like, I have no idea what goes on that level like that beyond me.  But yeah, I'm like, what if I mean, the thing you said about like boutique firms driving transformation, like that makes that tracks for me, like that makes a lot of sense.  But I'm also like, you know, I feel like with advisor relationships, there must be such a broad range of like quality and outcomes.  It's a market for lemons, I think. And I think part of it, though, must not be because the advisor is bad, but purely because you only have such a like limited time and small slice.  Like, it's just really hard to like really deliver results in like, you know, like one hour a quarter or whatever.  So I feel like this might be really good for that. Yeah, there's another book I really like, A Trusted Advisor.

54:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you heard of it? It's nice, it's old, so I like old books. Usually they're not so marketing-oriented. And that guy, that author, he talks a lot about the ethos of advisory work.  So it's not about sales and tricks. It's about how do you become this person that is an expert, and at some point you create a relationship with your clients that they ask you for things about their will, like, oh, I'm going to die and I want my wife to be taken care of, this kind of thing.  So, because I think, to be honest, like, on a personal level, that's what I like the most about consulting, is that I think I'm very much kind of a right-hand kind of guy.  I have that kind of personality, I think, and I want to be a... Good one. So, like, if we were to use godfather metaphors, I would be like, I would prefer to be the consiglieri, not the godfather.  Yeah. So it just speaks to me, you know, that kind of thing. Okay. Okay.

55:15 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  So you've thought about this. But, yeah, it's like, how do you, how do we make, how do you become the trusted advisor to trusted advisors for your business?

55:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Exactly. That's a whole thing. So, in a sense, like, if we're going to go meta, like, in this conversation, I didn't arrive at this conversation with, like, oh, let's close the sale, right?  I think that was obvious. But at the same time, I also know that by being open and sharing these things, I mean, you can see that you can trust me.  So it's not really manipulative, but I'm aware that by being transparent, this generates a certain level of openness to other things that I might say, right?  So, And that mode for me is really easy. I think it's actually what I need to kind of regulate, calibrate a little, because I go really fast into that mode.  I just want to be helpful. I just want to tell people cool things, you know, and I need to be a little bit smarter about that.  Same.

56:20 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Okay, let's, yeah, let's, I feel like there's, I don't know what yet, but yeah, there's something. You have so many, like, references.  I love it. How do you, like, where, yeah, did you, like, get a master's degree or something?

56:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, I just always felt, do you know Venkatesh Chau? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's, that was like, oh, wait a minute, there's this, like, no one usually knows Venkatesh Chau, so this.  Mm Let's go cut straight. And I was like, okay, I need to know more about this world. Like, what is this guy reading?  It's impossible to read, but he reads, right? He reads a lot. But then I started pulling on that string and trying to get really curious about conversations like this.  Like, oh, you do something different with your mind. Like, how does it work? So I think that was it.

57:24 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Are you into crypto at all?

57:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. No, I think, no, I regret it, but no, I'm not. Okay.

57:36 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I mean, yeah, good for you. I feel like I know a lot of people and spaces that you would maybe not, I mean, you would at the very least enjoy them.  Like, I don't really need a lot of Venkatash Rao fans who aren't into crypto. So, but I like. You are on Teapot then.

57:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

57:58 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Not really. really.

58:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Adjacent? Adjacent?

58:02 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  feel like it's... Do you consider yourself part of it?

58:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, not really, but I think I'm a bit of a lurker. But it was an important thing to find on the internet a few years ago.  I like, oh, okay. I'm weird in the same way these guys are. Sure. I'm a lurker.

58:22 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I don't really love the, like... I feel like I'm farther along in my, like, personal healing journey than a lot of those folks, but I don't care to, like, share...  Yeah, that part of it, I don't like. Yeah, absolutely.

58:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, they share a lot. And there was a moment that I was, like, leaning too hard on that stuff as well.  But, yeah. But the point is, I think, for sure, I mean, there's a kinship of mine here. We are intrigued.  I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. And I think there's something in there. I don't know exactly what yet. I'm open to discussing it.  I don't think we need... To, you know, put a specific timeline on it. It's just, like, at some point, if we make it, like, let's try to make something, then we mean it.  Yeah, I have to think.

59:10 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, let me, like, study your stuff more. Does your wife have a website?

59:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She does. I don't think you'll see much about workshops there, but are you on the newsletter? Sorry? Are you on the newsletter?  Oh, no. That's probably the best place. Okay, okay. I'll send you some links. Okay.

59:35 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  I mean, I think it's, like, the value is there, and, like, how, what and how we deliver value is, like, same audience, right?  Same vibe. But, yeah, we both have this, like, how do we monetize it more? So that's obviously the key.  But, yeah, I'm excited to think about it.

59:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I love to think about this. I'm glad you sent that message. I'm glad you commented.

1:00:09 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Very serendipitous. Great to meet you. How's my...? It's good. It's a very nasal sound.

1:00:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh no, can you do it for me? Yeah, joaol. Joaol. Good, good. Okay. It's like Jew and wow.

1:00:30 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  My mom's name is Jew. So, yeah, so, yeah.

1:00:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. It's the same, the same.

1:00:36 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Okay, wow, okay. I was a little mistaken. Yeah, so good to meet you. Let's, yeah, let's be in touch.  Let's be in touch.

1:00:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, do you wanna, I don't know, schedule something or just leave it marinating?

1:00:51 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Um, I think marinate. I think since we're connected, like, I'm definitely a pinger, so.

1:00:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I'm not.

1:01:00 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Yeah, I'm not worried about losing touch. Perfect, perfect.

1:01:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Excellent. That's what I was thinking about. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. You too.

1:01:11 - Jess Sun (Mouthpiece)
  Bye. Bye. Bye.
