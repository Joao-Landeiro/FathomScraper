0:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Print, or do I look different to you? I'm seeing you like we're on TikTok.

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, actually, this is just a MacBook camera, and I was using some other camera, and I stopped using it, and apparently everything got better, which is a bit annoying, because I paid money for the other camera, so I don't know.  Well, no, no, no.

0:24 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay, I'm going to send it to you in the chat. It's a Google Meet setting, okay? All right, here, hold on.  Look at my screen. Oh, wait, no, it just changed. Whatever, it doesn't matter. Anyway, great to see you. Great to see you.  How are you? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm glad to be here. Well, wait, hold on, hold on.  It's a little bit of a BS answer. Let me give you the true answer. Thank you. So family life is going really well.

1:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice.

1:08 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I'm like very tight on cash all of a sudden. What just happened? Because I sold a bunch of projects at the beginning of the year.  And then I don't know, man. I'm just tight. And so just today I was really like realizing, I'm like, man, I got to be like very careful for the next month and a half.  Until I land something. Because I have other deals that I've been talking to for two months, you know. But I think what happened was, sorry to hit you with something heavy.  just trying to give you the truth.

1:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  like the word friends, so. Yeah.

1:52 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  The sales cycle is really long on what I'm selling. Because it's not like, you know. I need a new cell phone.  They have the iPhone. costs $1,000. I'll buy it. It's like, gosh, we need help. This guy's retiring. Or really, the truth is, more than retiring, it's people feel like they have messy processes and they want help, you know, but they get the concept.  And I'm like, well, how did I sell them before? I'm like, well, I kind of sold them because I'd been talking to people for a long time.  It just so happened that when I started, a lot of those conversations, you know, clinched right at the end, you know?  And so then I'm going like, man, okay, maybe I was a little overconfident, not in what I'm doing. I love what I'm doing and I will do it, but in my ability to rapidly sell.  So, it's weird because I think I should feel fear, but like when I try to go into my body and like, what am I feeling?  There's a little fear, but it's more like. Okay, got to act, you know, which is good. My body tends to be action-based.  like, what am I going to do? So that's my true answer.

3:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you for the honest answer. Yeah, so on my side, yeah, a little bit tight as well, but some things are starting to bear some fruit, and it looks like, I think it's the same thing as with your service.  Like, people are usually not like, oh my god, I need a workshop right now.

3:42 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Right.

3:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so there's that. But I've started, and you set me on this path, which is like, I keep on going down the path of getting more serious about sales, like learning the...

4:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Basics and so on.

4:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I got some training on that. And I think part of the reason was like, okay, so I'm paying for this one.  And I really wanted to, you know, I need to apply these things. But it connects with the things you taught me.  And which is also very reassuring because it feels that it revolves around curiosity. And I think, yeah. So there's that.  I'm also, yesterday, I kind of almost wrapped up the podcast thing. And it was a lot of work. And there were times where I was like, this is just a waste of time.  This is crazy. I'm doing this like the wrong way. But I just, there was so much sunk cost that if I gave up on that and like, I had interviewed people, I couldn't stop.  So I, yeah, it's true. And I'm glad I did it because now there's something. And what else?

4:58 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, I'm happy that I did.

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's, and I still have the kind of the nagging feeling that workshops, I don't know if they are, I think they are the thing, but I don't know, I don't think that's the label that people are looking for.  So, yeah, that's a constant doubt. But, well, I've been having more conversations and trying to understand more about how people think about these things, which is very useful.  So, there's that. But, yeah, this is my more, you know, equally textured answer to how I might do it.

5:39 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, two things occurred to me while you were talking. One is, I heard a friend say the other day, lower the bar, like lower the standard.  And he's a really good guy, very smart. And he... It does excellent work. I think his point was, sometimes things take time.  And so what if you and I just said, yeah, I mean, our standard of sales expectation is pretty low.  It would be nice if we sold one every six months or something. You know, now that's not much to live on.  But like, imagine you went into that headspace where you're like, yeah, I'm a little bit poor right now because I'm starting a business and like, I'm not going to sell a lot.  That actually, I can even feel comfort literally just saying that. It's, I would rather embody a lower sales goal that I've already beaten, you know, and then everything I'm doing is surplus after this.  But you know, I'm tight on cash because that's what I'm expecting. That came to me. And then the other thing that came was, when I said to you I wasn't afraid, it like became very clear to me like I am afraid.  I'm scared. I feel fear, and I really do feel it pretty viscerally, and I didn't realize that until I told you I wasn't, I was like, no, no, I am, which is okay.  It's okay to be afraid. I believe that. I accept that I am. Yeah, that's all it is. I'm working with this guy.  He's like the coolest guy. He was a Premier League player, soccer player, and he's all about like – he's a performance coach, and he's all about that like life just is hard, and that's okay, and you just – you push.  His two words are sweat and courage. He's like, you're going to feel scared a lot of the time, but you can try hard, and you can be brave despite the fear, and like that's fine.  That's all you have to do. There's nothing more than that, and I found a lot of comfort in it because I think I've – sorry, I'm like turning this in.  I think I've held the truth of my fear at bay most of my adult life. I've been like, well, I'm not really afraid.  No, I've been afraid for a decade, man. I mean, I had a honeymoon, baby, and I had to provide.  I didn't have any skills, really. So it's comforting. I feel comforted to be like, yeah, I'm afraid, so what?  Anyway, that's it. No, I agree.

8:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you had mentioned this guy before when you said the sweat and courage is wrong about. But yeah, it's very reassuring to know that at least we're not insane, and I know this is far for the course.

8:42 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, and also, like, sorry, I cut you off, but looking at a guy like you, if you told me you were afraid, I would say, yeah, that's fine.  But like, I know you'll be fine. Just because of what I know of you. I'm like, there's no chance you don't make it in the long run.  I'm like, that's like a zero. Yes, you've got it, you know, it's just timing.

9:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you for saying that. Yeah, I'll return back to this clip many times because of that one.  Yeah.

9:16 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Thank you.

9:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. OK, so I like this start. I think that you always push for this, you know, be honest about things, be present.  And with that, let me think how we connect with what we're doing. Let me see a little link. Now I will also share the screen.  OK. OK. Well, might need to do a quick recap because some time is best. Yeah.

9:57 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  OK. If you can join. One sec. Did you drop it in the chat? Yeah.

10:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, I think I see what you're talking about. There's like this rounded corners moving around. Yeah, it just changed a little bit.

10:29 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Enter the password. just Nate Jebb, right? No, it's Nate, Nate. Yeah, Nate, And you're in.

10:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to pull it to me. So we see the same things. Okay. So we started by looking at, you know, your view on craft, your view on life.

10:59 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And then from there.

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We got some main ideas, some main concepts, because what we were trying to do is to get to a couple of visual frameworks that you can use to explain your work, what you do, and what people can get out of it.  So we did that first harvesting thing, and then we've kind of selected some ideas to work on, and then we took those ideas and we started to kind of unwrap them, and we got to these different things.  They're not yet turned into pictures, right? They're just things that, these are questions that are worth to answer to possible clients, and then towards the end of the...  of the last session, we explored, like, okay, let's get a process view of, like, your basic methodology, which was gather, organize, and train.  Yes.

11:58 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  And we kind of zoomed in.

12:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then I've created some slides for it that I think you've used in the presentation too.

12:07 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  welcome.

12:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you. Did they work? I mean, were they functional for the conversation?

12:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, and the way I use them is I've sent them to people. Okay. And they're like, oh, okay, I get it.  So I didn't really, I haven't really talked from them because I found that, I found that talking from them, there was enough on the screen that it was too much for me to just be like, and here it is.  I was reading it. Basically, I was just reading it. So what I found was I would show it for like 30 seconds to give the understanding.  Like I had a very formal process and it made sense, but then I wouldn't stay. I would just explain it verbally, so I felt like it really bona fide my credibility, but it was more valuable as something to send to someone, so they're like, oh, I get what you do.

13:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it.

13:13 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah.

13:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so in that sense, I don't even have them right here, so let me see if I find them.

13:30 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Veritas process. I just, to be clear, they were very helpful. I really liked them. I was just giving you feedback on how I ended up using them.  No, no, for sure, for sure. No, that's exactly the kind of answer I need.

13:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

13:48 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Perfect. Okay.

13:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, for now, the plan was, let's speak a few things and draft some visual frameworks that we can later in October.  Into more Polish things. And from my understanding, like, we will do this thing later. I will turn this into Visual Framework.  The slides are also in that way. If we go back to some of the questions we tried to list before around the way you work, like this stuff.  Do you think that having visuals for this would help you with the conversations you're having right now? Or the conversations you're having right now are surfacing a different set of questions that it would be better for us to have Visual Frameworks for?  Like, what kind of questions are people asking now in this current cycle?

15:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Shall pull want we So, what I'm selling is getting me in the door, and it's not what people need.  Okay, tell me more about that. And I just went to a construction site where they dig holes underground to a fiber optic cable.  And the guy who hired me wanted me to literally document how they make the holes and how they use the machine.  Well, because he had hired a trainer from the dealership that sells the machine to come in and train the employees.  When I got there, I realized the company that the trainers from has made an hour-long detailed video. So, I don't need to re-record a video.  They have a great one. And then I also learned on the job site that there are all these issues, like the 20-year-old kids who work there make mistakes all the time.  Like they'll just take the keys to the machine home with them. And then the older guys can't work on the weekend because these kids just took the keys.  So then you think like, well, why wouldn't they just get an extra pair of keys? Why wouldn't they do that?  So I'm like helping them get the extra pair of keys and stuff like that. So what's happening is I'm getting in the door.  Everyone's like, oh, I should just document my process. But in reality, people don't need like a formal documentation. They need just help on like the stuff they've been dragging their feet on doing, like stuff they didn't want to do, I can come in and do.  So it feels like a completely different offering when I get into the situation than when I sold it. And so, and that's been true across the board.  So I'm not sure how to think about that. My first thought was just selling. Onboarding guide, come in, document, do it, give them the onboarding guide.  That's it. That's what we agreed to. But then give them a new proposal for the opportunities to help that I saw.

17:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is, I think, there's two things that come to mind when I hear this. So there's an aspect of this that I think is somewhat familiar to my reality, which is people sometimes, you know, they describe what they need in a certain way, but actually it's just kind of a hook or you need to have something for people to latch on to, right?  And maybe the onboarding is the thing. Yes. But then you see these other opportunities. And for me, balancing this, oh, people trust me and ask me to do things that are not, like, on the menu.  Okay. It's good because it comes from a place of trust, but also I get a little bit confused because it's always very ad hoc, right?  Like, oh, so you need, like, so I need, you guys need help to think about, you know, making an extra pair of keys.  Like, if this was the initial approach, they would never hire, but then this is the thing that actually delivers the most value, right?  Correct. That's a great way to say it. And I think this is, I think this is an interesting thing to noodle on because I think this is a pattern that it comes with people trusting it.  Like, people trust you. They'll ask you to do things that you had not planned for. And it's some of those opportunities, I would assume, make no sense.  But if we can shape them in a way that makes sense, it would be nice. It's a great way to put it.

18:53 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  The onboarding is kind of your Trojan horse, right?

18:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It didn't design it to be, like, a... You can switch, but it's just like what people want, and then it gives you access to other things.

19:04 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Right.

19:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Given that what you end up doing is not necessarily what people buy, would it make sense to frame the conversation in a way that people bought sooner, and it got you sooner to this trusted advisor role?

19:31 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I don't think so, because if I flip and say, well, actually, I'm doing this other thing now, they don't want to hear that.  They keep wanting to think I'm making the onboarding guide, but I'm actually doing other stuff. The onboarding guide is the thing that allows me to say, well, I'm going to keep talking to people.  I know you get the concept, but... Let me just give you one more example for my own sake. With the Blue Delta Jeans company, I went there and realized their customer service person, they only have one, is so skilled, is so good.  But he gets probably twice the amount of emails a day that he can answer in a day. So he's always behind.  So basically, the jeans are $500. If you call him, he'll talk to you for 30 minutes. And it's exactly the experience you're hoping you'd get from a custom Blue Jeans company.  It's just not enough. So some people are getting the best experience in the world. Some people are getting a terrible experience because he's not getting better than them.  So what I need to help them do is figure out what does Randy do and how do we hire someone to help him.  But that almost I have to do secretly. Now, what I could do is just not really help and just not get into that.  But I know the onboard. Green Guide is not going to help them as much as this Randy thing. So I get stuck knowing what should I do.  Okay.

21:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's two things I think we've kind of touched on here. Just to make sure I don't lose this.

21:21 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I'll write it down.

21:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's two things we've touched on here. So the first one is, where is it? Just a second. I am on the mirror on the computer, but that was not on the iPad.  Okay, now I am.

21:48 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  So visual frameworks. Just sell the bruises.

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It seems that it's good enough as it is.

22:06 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Do you agree with that? Yes, I think that what we have really makes it feel that we have a tight process, and great, that's what you do.

22:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. And now, the thing that we are dealing with is, is it the long sales cycle? Do you think that?

22:27 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, no, I think – okay, I'm going to take two minutes to talk about that because I don't really know.  Okay. The absolute truth is this. I had leads coming from a company, from Playbook Builder. The only reason we had leads is one of our investors was friends with all of these partners, and he told them to sell.  So it was kind of a really nice system. Yes. I talked to those people, and I showed them Playbook Builder, the end product, and they said, I think you could help us.  And then what I sold them was, I'll help you build it out in Playbook Builder. So I both had the final deliverable they could see, which actually didn't end up helping people when I'd build it, but they didn't know that when they saw it.  And they wanted my help. So I had a lead system, I had a presentation system, and I don't have either of those now.  The other deal that I closed was for a friend who I had worked for in the past, and he really trusted me.  I'd really helped him. But he was really hiring me as a favor. So he didn't have a deep need, and I gave it to him at a discount rate.  So I have proven I can sell this. Let's pass to I'll get eyes. of course, escape Under a certain system that I no longer have.  So I have not sold anything the new way. Now, I've not really fully tried to because I've been trying to fulfill this business.  And then the other like crystal clear true thing is I've never created a deliverable that my clients use all the time.  Because when I was at Playbook Builder, I did like six or seven of these build outs. And everyone was like, oh, man, I get it.  They liked meeting with me. They liked the process. But then in the end, they would come to me and go, we don't really know how to use it.  So, again, I know I'm in the right area. But the truth is I don't have a big sales process and I don't have a big product.  Those are fine. That's the truth. What do I do from here? So I know that doesn't help us with what we're doing necessarily, but it is what's true.  No, I think I think it helps us.

24:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. So. Because what I'm thinking is, the deliverables thing is really tricky, because on one hand, people seem to want some sort of a deliverable, right?  Right.

25:21 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  That's what they think at the start.

25:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  it needs to be compelling. But once they get to work with you, they realize that most of the value is not on the deliverable, right?  So at that point, we kind of deflate the importance of the deliverable. But it is something you're committed to, because that's what they bought, and you need to deliver the deliverable.  Yeah. Now, if putting together the deliverable, because it was the thing that got them in, and it's the right thing to offer, pulls too much of your attention out of, you know,  Nate as a service, in a very paradoxical way, the client suffers because at some point they realize, wait, wait, wait, it's not about the deliverable, it's about working with Nate.  And now Nate has limited time to work with me because Nate is working on that deliverable that I said I needed.

26:22 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yes.

26:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

26:30 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Okay, well, and then just another detail because I don't, I should do something with this. One of my clients, it has nothing to do with this.  He's a guy in our family who has a warehouse and he needed to fill it up with renters. Okay.  And so he asked me if I would help him and out of, and I said, yeah, I said, I can't help you.  I don't know how to, I'm not like a commercial real estate guy. And he said, no, I really think you can help.  So what I told him I would do is we'd make a list every week of – we'd meet every week, make a list of people I could call.  I would call them, and then we would check back in next week. If it worked, we'd do more of it.  If it didn't work, we'd come up with a new hypothesis. Everything I've done, even though that's not my product at all, that has had the most traction.  He's got a number of big clients that he may close a deal with simply because I picked up the phone.  I don't want to do that. I don't want to change what I'm doing as an offering, but I guess I'm just sharing with you because I trust you and I'm trying to get my thoughts out.  I almost feel like I should try to get some more of those engagements just to keep cash coming in because what I'm talking about with you here is a phenomenal idea and product.  It's just not fully there yet, and I need a way to get faster cash. So that's a distraction from what we're saying.  It's context.

28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't think it's a distraction, but I understand your point. So thinking out loud, just so, yeah, what I'm thinking right now is for the context of this conversation, and I think like what I'm feeling might be the same thing that you sometimes feel with your clients.  For the context of this conversation, I'm like, okay, I had agreed to work, to retribute, to pay back, and there's a better word for this, a nicer word, but just be kind, rewind.  What you taught me, and to do this with visual frameworks, right? And I was like, okay, this is what I committed to.  But at the same time, I'm like, is it the thing that would be the most useful for you right now?  And I'm not sure it is.

28:47 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  It's not. Yeah, okay. But what you delivered me already was amazingly useful, but if we do more of it, it doesn't meet my new bigger need.  Exactly, exactly.

28:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the ROI on that is flattening, right?

28:59 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

29:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Given this, is there, because I love, you know, doing these things with you and thinking, like, what is the one thing that maybe I could help you think about or help you with that would be most valuable for you?

29:24 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I really think I could get more clients doing that other thing. Like, I really need one more client. was charging five grand a month for it, which I felt was a great value to them, great value to me.  If I had one or two more of those, then I would have time to do, like, I'm really in a sweet spot with this company.  I just need the cash. The best way to do that would be to go to companies I know, because again, that shortens the sales cycle and say, can I do this service for you?  And that's probably 20 phone calls, and then that's what I have. I mean, I have a lot of people in my network, but that would be a fit for this, probably 20.  So, this is where I need help. I don't know if you can help. I need to figure out a way to get cash quickly.  I believe I have an idea of how to do that, but I'm kind of stuck at that point. I'm willing to do anything.  I'm willing to take action, but I'm not exactly sure how to take action besides call my buddy Cam, who's in commercial real estate, call him after this call.  I don't really know what I would do next. I'm really I Go ahead.

31:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's say you call that guy. What's his name? Cameron.

31:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Cameron. You call Cameron.

31:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what would you say on that call? It's like you tell him about the thing you've done for this warehouse?  Kind of thing?

31:31 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, and I even realize now that wouldn't go anywhere because he's paid on commission. So he would probably today agree to let me do this for him, but that he would pay out cash to me upon getting a commission, not like a monthly fee.  I mean, it's worth calling him. Maybe he would do a monthly fee. But I guess here's what I'm doing.  Okay, so we've always talked about working together. Like, we did some good work together in this Lutheran Brothers deal.  He's like, yep. I did something for them that I think would help you, and I'd like you to consider hiring me for it.  Okay, what is it? It's basically using the sales tracker I showed you to have me make calls on your behalf.  Yep. Are you interested in that? Maybe. Yeah, I don't know if I need the help. And then to which I'd say, I don't think you do need the help.  Like, you're not in dire straits. But you have said you want a partner. You have said you want a shot in the arm.  I'm in a moment where I would like to work with you, and if I have the window of time where I could, would you be willing to give it a shot?  It's not a commitment to a longer-term thing. It's just an experiment we're both running. He's like, yeah, I'd give it a shot.  How much does it cost? I'd say, I charged this guy five grand. Would you pay that five grand a month?  He's like, eh, it seems a little high. Like, okay, what can you handle? He's like, I'd probably do $1,500 a month.  I'm like, that's too low. Like, can you meet in the middle? It's three grand a month. We'll do it as a two-month test, six grand.  He's like, yeah, I'd probably do that. You know, that's how I imagine the flow of the conversation. Mm-hmm. Him I know so well, right?  I mean, and then I could call Abe at Hambone. And then potentially I could even call, I don't want to call John a playbook builder.  I don't want to do that. I could call Axios. I could call, I mean, I don't want to list it all right here, but that's, that's where I'm at.  And so, well, wait, before you go, let me say a counterpoint. Like, let me argue against what I just said.  What I'm talking about is a distraction from what I actually intend to do, which is this company, Veritas. There are ways to get money that are not selling.  You know, like, I can go to friends and family and say, like, hey, I want to do a shared earnings agreement with you.  Basically, you'll get paid back and get an additional. Will you invest? You know, and I think all I would need is, like, 20 grand, and that's two people, 10 grand from two people.  I could even get 20 from a single person, probably. That makes more sense to me because otherwise I'm selling my time.  And then I'm not focusing on the thing I'm focusing on. I'm just going to be in a bind.

35:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the first one was, oh, I didn't even cross my mind, so it was a nice learning thing, the idea of getting shared earnings agreements and stuff like that.  I also do agree that it could be a distraction. Immediately after that came the thought of... Could we... So there's two things right now, and I think that's the difficult thing to balance.  there's like, we need to get cash. We need to do it relatively quickly, so we might need to put a lot of focus behind that initiative.

36:07 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, and when I say that, I mean in the next two months. In the next 60 days, I need to have a more consistent cash flow streamlined up.

36:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let's put a pin on that one. And the other thing is, if you could get this cash flow from Veritas, it would be better, of course.  But the risk is, based on your experience, you don't really have a track record to know if you can make it in those 60 months, 60 days with Veritas, right?

36:50 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, and I actually believe I can't unless I get lucky because I had two projects. I'd say 10 or 11 that I've sold where the person bought on the second call.  It was like, done, want to do it, got it, 15 grand, let's go. But then all the other, I mean, one of them took a year to sell, you know, the others took much longer.  However, the real estate developer was the fast one, and I had other real estate developers move quickly. I could call on that target market and try to sell them.

37:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, the one that said yes sooner was a real estate developer?

37:34 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, and I actually had real estate developers consistently be fast with buying our product. They're just fast-moving people.

37:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So when you frame it like that, it feels like less of a distraction that you do the sales for real estate.  It's still a little bit of a distraction, but it feels less so. Oh, like you're saying it.

38:00 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Almost flipped me into projects, because I was saying I could do Veritas work for real estate developers. They were the best to hire me.

38:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I understood that. It's like, again, like a Trojan horse.

38:14 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I come in and do sales calls, and they're like...

38:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, the way I was thinking about it is, the sales calls, I assume it's a more known kind of service.  It's like, oh, people don't need to explain much about what's involved in the sales call and how to get paid for it.  Like, no, they've paid for this stuff before, right?

38:38 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Right.

38:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That they get it. You don't need to educate them on the product.

38:41 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Right.

38:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But at the same time, it's an opportunity for them to work with you, see how you think, and see that you have this structured way of doing things.  So, if it were the case that real estate developers were not a good market for very... Maybe it would be more of a distraction.  Maybe if you realize, oh, restaurants are the best client, and this is real estate, is very different. But it isn't that different, right?  Even if you're occupying different roles, it doesn't seem to be that different. Right. And so I think that's a good thing.  It feels less of a distraction.

39:22 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Because it's building up a possible client base with relationships. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

39:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could you mix it a little bit? Okay, let's say. Let's use an exaggerated scenario as a starting point. Yeah.  So you lean into this, helping the real estate developers sell inventory? Is that the way? Move inventory?

40:01 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, for this guy, was a warehouse. I was just helping him get leasing clients for his warehouse. A real estate developer does a different thing where they would work with a commercial real estate broker to do that.

40:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Okay, so in this extreme example, you put all the energy into that. You do not do any Veritas stuff, and then three months on the line, you're like, oh, snap, I need to reorient this ship again towards that, right?  Yeah. So this is an exaggerated example. On the other extreme, you're like, I'm not taking any real estate sales stuff.  I'm just going to focus on the Veritas thing. Right. But there's probably a few sections in the middle where you can get some of the cash flow, but also use that opportunity to do nano Veritas.  I don't know, maybe the way you, let's say you are helping these guys selling real estate or selling real estate, but you make a rule or a heuristic or a standard that you dedicate a certain amount of attention to doing it in a way that would make sense.  You know, like, oh, I'm going to do this and I'm going to leave behind the playbook on how to do this.  I don't know.

41:36 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, that's a perfect example because I know there are guys in real estate who are retiring and they have these niche clientele.  Like one guy sells like very, very large malls across America. How is he doing that? Because he's about to leave.  I mean, and then it combines it where I could say like, well. I don't want to try to do too much synthesis of it, but there are people there I could do.  Because you see, it's almost like the Veritas product. One of my things I do is I fly out and I try to do the job.  It helps me understand the questions to ask. But in this case, doing sales would be trying to do the job.  But weirdly, they could get more sales and they'd get my product, which I don't want to say because that's confusing.

42:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But yes, yes, it's much more of a show, don't tell kind of thing, right? Okay. So the opportunity that we are seeing here is, correct me if I'm wrong, is mixing both things.  Mixing is not even the word. It is like integrating both things, which is helping real estate companies, but within that world, focus on specialty real estate companies that might have, that might be facing end-of-life questions.

43:23 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Is this? Yeah, end-of-career, yeah.

43:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  End-of-career, yeah. End-of-life of the company. Yeah, but end-of-career.

43:31 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Or succession questions, right?

43:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right.

43:37 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, and then, but now what we're talking about is like a sales target, like who I should go after.  There's other, there are other people too in town that I've not activated yet, you know, that want to refer me to their clients.  And why am I saying that? I'm saying it because what I'm realizing is Veritas is good. I've done a lot.  The right stuff, I've got a video, I've got a website now, I've got referral partners, but the sales process takes a long time.  So I'm thinking, how do I get short-term cash while I'm doing that sales process? I need something I can do on my own time asynchronously with the client.  And I could do these sales calls if I do it in real estate, that not only gets me cash, but it gets me relationships that actually could be for Veritas in the long run.  And what I should do is at the same time, concurrently, go to Cam, not as a client, but as a connection point to CBRE, try to offer the sales service to his real estate developer friends, and then also at the same time getting my referral network sending leads, because I know referrals work.  That's probably what it all is. So do the sales thing for real estate developers and make sure I'm getting referrals from my friends for Veritas.

45:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I feel solid on this side. How do you feel about it?

45:09 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Well, there's a glitch in the logic because real estate developers, I said that because they want Veritas services. They don't want what I'm doing for this warehouse, which is like commercial real estate brokerage services.  So I have not actually solved the short-term cash flow problem because I need to find a target market that I could turn on right away for that.  I know like, man, it's such a good product because I don't know if you knew this, but 20% of did you know calls lead to a sale.  So... So... So... So if you have a current client and you call them and say, did you know I also offer this service?  Do you want to buy it? 20% of the time, that's a sale. And so literally, if you just hire someone like me to call your current client base, you'll get sales out of it.  And that's not what I want to focus on because I don't want to just be a professional cold caller.  But that's the pitch to get those clients. So, okay. All right. I got to get my wherewithal. I know what I'm doing and I'm acting like I'm so confused, but I'm not.  What's true is I have a large group of people who I know. Some of them may need the help that I can offer with the sales thing because that's what I want to do.  For the next six months, I want to have at least, let's call it 10 grand a month coming in from that stuff.  Okay. So I got to go get that. Additionally, I need to turn on my referral network from Veritas. That's it.  That's what I got to do. 10 grand a month coming in from the sales calls. I'm going to develop that through my current network.  If you're not in my phone, you're not going to be a client. I mean, you can be, but that's my target market, people I know.  The way I'm going to do that is I'm going to call them up, and I'm just going to seek to help.  I'm going to say, how are you doing? What's going on? And I'm say, hey, I'm trying this new thing where I'm just trying to help people.  What are you working on that you need to help with? And I've done that before, and it leads people to share.  That's how I do the sales process. If I can connect the sales thing I'm saying or the Veritas thing, I'll do that.  So basically what I've said here is this. Short-term cash flow for the next six months, 10 grand. I can sell it more quickly if I do this sales thing.  So offering I have, works. I want to tell Veritas in the long run, I'm going to get referral. The way I'm going to target my own new business, because I've intended to do more cold calling, is taking the people I know.  I just said to you the script that I will use with them. It's non-offensive. It's people I love. It will be fun to check in with them.  That's what I have to do right now. And what I'm learning is I've spent too much time in the past couple months on, like, whale, like, large account sales.  I'm in short-term cash flow mode. So that's cool. I can have some of that, but that should be 20% of my time, whereas I've spent 80% of my time on it.  That's all that's happening here. So. We've got a plan. We've got a plan. So, and it's interesting, too, because you helped me just now, but it's literally exactly what is happening to me with clients.  Like, I basically am on the phone with you going, hey, what you do. Super valuable. It's not what I need in this moment.  Help me pivot. And you did the wonderful thing of being a listener, which is always the most effective, one of the most effective tools all the time.  And I have a plan.

49:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This feels good. I think you can go and do it. Is there something I can help you with on that front?  You can improve while later if nothing comes to mind right now.

49:37 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Yeah, I just want to pause and go look for it if there is something. Okay. We, this is kind of weird.  Like one of the cold call things that helps is just generating momentum. that going going to then, you So if you had a list of people, I don't want you to do your personal contacts, but companies that you might be able to help or people you might be able to help, but I would need their phone number.  I could make calls on your behalf. I wouldn't pitch you. I would just make a call and say, hey, I'm a guy.  I'm a broker. I represent consultants. You need a workshop or whatever it is. And if were interested, I could send them to you.  I wouldn't charge you for that, but that would help me because one of my challenges is making call lists.  I just need to get calling, except even as I say that, that will distract me. won't help me. Yeah, it feels like a distraction.

50:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I was digging for something.

50:43 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  There's nothing there. All right. All right, João.

50:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you want to use the rest of this call and we just stay on the call and you start building a list of...

50:53 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  Oh, my gosh. It would be awesome. Yeah. Because we have the time. can just stay here. Thank you. I've scheduled for this.  Yeah. So I'm going to make a list of the top 20 people I'll call from my contacts. Got it.  Okay. Thank you. Thank I got two. Nice.

52:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ten percent. Ten percent of the way down.

52:14 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  This is a good way to do it. I'm just taking screenshots of the object, and then I'll go through my photos.  That's a nice one.

52:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Faster.

52:57 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  I think I've got a... I've got it. Thank Thank you. Thank Okay, let's see what I got. I think I may have 20.  One, two, three, four, five, nine, ten, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, five more.

Thanks for letting me be open, too. I didn't realize I was feeling nervous. And then I was sharing with you.  I'm like, I am. And that's OK. But you helped me. You've helped me many times.

56:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm glad to be back. Have a nice couple of calls. See you next time.

56:17 - Nate Jebb (Veritas)
  All right. See you. Bye bye.
