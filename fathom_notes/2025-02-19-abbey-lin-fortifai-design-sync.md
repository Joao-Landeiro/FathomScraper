0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Everybody's on business mode now, full force, head to the grindstone. Just work hard.

0:10 - Ivan
  No play hard, just work hard, no play hard. Yeah, for now.

0:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, good, Yes, yes, yes. Good morning.

0:26 - Ivan
  Is she joining or?

0:39 - brightion
  I'm not sure if she's joining, but I know she's coming back from her cabin today. So maybe she's not at home yet.  Okay.

0:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, in that case, let's just assume she's not coming and we use this for ourselves to see if there's anything we can look on our side.  Do you agree?

0:57 - Ivan
  Okay.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In review, this thing is done, create a flow for approval form, any form, and let's check this out. Okay.  pending approval, we see something like this. And then we open, we see the answers. We have approval, rejects. Romeo, were you there?  No, okay.

1:40 - Romeu Rodrigues
  She was following the police to be able to develop it. Good, good.

1:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So our thinking on this actually, it is a good time to make sure. Whenever we have this dark blue pop-up thing, the pattern has been  the dark blue pop-up is usually around approvals or getting things. It's more like a thing that the admins do, right?  Either you approve something or you deploy something. But the form, the forms can be filled either by the admins, for instance, carbon reporting is an admin kind of thing, right?  But also the GIFTS form, it's an employee kind of thing, right? They can share the same language. And we didn't design this pattern, it kind of emerged, but it seems that the platform is moving in that way.  So when it's about like big deal, things that only the admin can do, it seems to be like this, open to discussion, okay?  And when we have like carbon reporting or other forms, any form that is less about approval, just collecting information, it just looks this kind of thing.  Intuitively, without having to check everything, does this make sense to you? Yeah, sure. Okay. I need to find that thing again, it's here.  Okay, perfect. So, Indecis, do you want us to navigate through them, or are you satisfied with what you can see?

3:21 - Ivan
  Yeah, I think I'm fine with this. So, what we need is a reductable, but we are missing that status, if you remember the step at the top that we discussed yesterday?

3:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's kind of a little timeline, right? Yeah, so that we know if it's line manager approval or not.

3:42 - Ivan
  Also, what I'm a bit confused now is this for all forms. mean, forms, are we saying controls now? So, would maybe prefer that we call this control for now, and later if we see the need for some other forms that are not controls to be approved or something that then we...  start calling them this but for now I would say for simplicity sake let's call these controls because they are controls I know forms and controls are same in this case but just so this I would this part of controls flow that's what I'm trying to say I'm not trying to make things complex so what we're is that the top line manager or that part or somewhere it doesn't have to be the same I'm fine with both we just need to have it that that information and then I would once this is confirmed I would move this into the controls page and sigma just for organization sake and that's my only two comments for this for now okay okay I think it makes sense what you're saying so just just to be absolutely absolutely sure because we are at the stage that we sometimes use different names for the same thing and the names yes for yeah so let's let's agree on

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  on things. When we talk about the form, and I'm thinking out loud right, so we're about a form, we are talking about a series of questions that people can answer.  Approval, when we're talking about approval, we're talking about getting a leader to level up the status of the collection thing, right?  It could be a form, could be It could be like a gift form, could be anything where people send me information and need to validate that.  Is this? Yeah, that's it.

6:10 - Ivan
  Okay.

6:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, and there's type one, which is like regular forms and type two So, the confusion I'm trying to clear in my head is that from a programming standpoint, I know that getting an approval is a little bit like a form, right?  But we just one question. Is that correct? Yeah. Okay. And I think sometimes I refer to that to do it in that way, maybe that this is making it more difficult.  No, it's not actually for me.

6:51 - Ivan
  I understand when you say forms and controls I understand it, but I'm not sure if every will and will and others will sort of let's try to keep it simple, but  I don't think there is anything so currently forms are controls so currently you can only implement a control that's a form I mean control is actually the confusing term to me at the beginning because what is a control you you never use that in English at least not me so so control is basically a way of controlling if you did something that's how I imagine it in my head and that's what makes sense to me the most so basically controls are some some ways of making sure that you are compliant with something that's how I understood it so so in this case forms are basically a way of making sure that you are compliant with I don't know carbon something or iso whatever so there are ways of measuring if we are good or bad or in something that's required for energy compliance so that's how that's how I understand controls no I think I think we see it in the same way okay and this is why I think it's important to to find

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  which that other people also also understand. Otherwise, we think. Anyway, that's very confusing. So all forms are all controls that are form from a technical perspective.  UV, but not all forms are controls, right? We have forms for other things like forms for. Actually, not all forms are all forms are controls, right?  Yeah.

8:29 - Ivan
  So this is not currently us, but I mean, if you want to get technical, the login form is not the control, but that's not what we are talking about.

8:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So not to introduce that into the mix.

8:41 - Ivan
  Maybe let's leave it out because I don't think anyone is thinking that way other than this and people who are in tech.  OK, I agree. agree with you. So, OK, all forms are controls. And so maybe the best way we can talk about this stuff is for now, for now, now, maybe the way

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  where we can address this now is always use the feature name, not the function name. So when we talk about the controls, okay, perfect.

9:07 - Ivan
  For now, yes, but once and once something more comes starts coming up from this, something other than forms, I don't know what can it be, maybe file up or something, we can maybe start up a little bit, controls are controls and I would merge this, whatever you did that in that page looks fine.  To me, I would just merge it with controls in one page so that we have it in one place since it's part of the controls flow.  That's my only requirement for this. It's easier to find, yeah.

9:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this thing, okay.

9:38 - Ivan
  Yeah, the one you showed right now, merge to be merged with controls, V2 controls page because it is part of that flow, right?  yeah. It's just different roles, I guess it's employee and admin approval and stuff like that. Got it, got it, got it.  So in that sense,

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  understood so in that sense let's let's say we are on this tab right and i don't remember does anyone have okay let's use a different one where's the gifts one it's in controls you can find it in controls yeah we took controls where is the i my god you are now in old oh no we took controls there and then go go find the that one sponsorships and donations gives an entertainment okay so this is this thing right yeah so let's say i know the design is not this but let's say i fill this in and say that somebody offered me a tiger right and you see you are the compliance officer you see how john got a tiger a tiger is really expensive and what you see it does it look like the form that i filled in in terms of aesthetics or does it look like this  this this thing which is the form that I filled in plus the approval layer.

11:04 - Ivan
  This is what I as admin or first line manager maybe uh yeah line manager first is this yeah. Okay okay so yeah we're we're good to go perfect no but I mean you first go to the table that you show it first there's a new row with the Jal Tiger input and then when I click there I come to this page like you showed so I think we are good there.  Okay so yeah we are just missing the two steps so line manager approval and admin approval but you can you can see that in the previous design let me know if you need help finding it.  If you know exactly where it is and you can go yeah I know yeah so it's here in iteration iteration one  Oh, it doesn't want to load for some reason. Come on, it's a mess, it's a mess, it's mess. You need to look at the other way.

12:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you look at it, it knows.

12:15 - Ivan
  It heard you, so it loaded instantly. It's like a cat. Okay, so here, finally.

12:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I see you.

12:29 - Ivan
  So this is the page you now did in the new design, and we are just missing this top part.  we can, as far as I'm concerned, can reuse it or just make it different, but I don't think this design for this stepper will fit in the new design exactly, but I'll leave that up to Romeo and you do what you think is best and put it in.

12:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we discussed it yesterday.

12:56 - Ivan
  Yeah, we did.

12:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We did, think we forgot. doing it but yeah yeah no worries no worries yeah okay so let's go back to JIRA great so I'll I'll keep this in the in progress because we need to add that include timeline timeline timeline top spare comments uh controls cool close okay okay uh safe uh update designer with only form for from submission so this is related which is this thing so here  Share this down.

14:02 - Ivan
  think that's kind of same thing. Yeah.

14:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's the same thing, yes.

14:10 - Ivan
  it's done.

14:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. So and Romeo and I, we spent a little bit of time just doing things on controls for covering reporting, just to get a vertical slice of what it could look like.  And what we have now is, so we keep this design with the tabs, right? We brought this. What are you showing now?

14:38 - Ivan
  OK. Thank you. Thank you for interrupting. So we keep this design with the tabs.

14:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We've changed the questions into the questions that Brighton, Abby, and us came up with. And this will be conditional, right?  Oh, do you have this one, actually, is this one? Do you have? Yes, then it then it opens and then we put the upload and this is still drafting, but just we are using the same design to follow that flow that we've discussed before.

15:10 - Ivan
  If you remember yesterday I showed you we can also show you you don't have to design this, but depending on your answer, for example, yes or no, we can show our high fields very easily.  So we can say yes, we can show this to field. If you say no, we don't have to show any of fields below that just like our general comment, you don't have to design anything for this.  We can go through this with Abby and decide which are optional fields. So that will help users fill in only what they need so that they don't see a of information on the screen that's useless to them if they don't have a generator, for example.  Got it. Now, I agree.

15:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  are putting everything here on a long thing, but then we assume that we can do the conditionals afterwards, but it's just easy to prove if they are old.

15:55 - Ivan
  Yeah, of course, of course. We are in agreement.

15:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Okay, that's it. On our side, anything on your side that you need us to change priorities or anything?

16:08 - Ivan
  So no, I said controls are the top priority. What's ready for development then? say this page that you showed me is more or less ready for development other than that stepper, which will be added for tomorrow, I guess.  So we can start working on that because we are starting to catch up on the design. That's why I'm asking this.  So I think I would say it's safe to say that what you showed me today is ready, except the stepper part, right?  So we can do that also, yeah. Okay, then we can do that part and I'm thinking what's left then on controls.  So if we have a proper drag flow, we just need to define this carbon emission stuff and then together we need to drag everything in my one place and see if all the buttons have correct or if all buttons have functionalities if they lead.  something that we need to and that's it. So I would say that I think we are near the end, at least design-wise.  So, yeah. But let's review after tomorrow after you make progress on this stuff. Got it. it.

17:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

17:21 - Ivan
  I think that one question you will know better than I did. other than carbon reporting, two things. Is there any other custom control?  Because I remember there was another custom control that was other than carbon reporting, if you know what I'm asking.  It might be related to third-party management, so we decided to postpone it until third-party management comes in, but I'm not sure.

17:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it was the way to manage third-parties that was similar to the way to manage controls. Okay.

18:00 - Ivan
  Yeah, if it's related to third party then I think you're fine because then that will come when we when we start doing third party then we'll do these things.  So I'd say we are okay there. Okay, got it.

18:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think it seems to me that the two main things is just get done with this design task and also organize the Figma.  We're really starting to see the cracks in the Figma.

18:24 - Ivan
  Yes, a small maybe small comment or note or ask for help while we're here. If you can please open login page of our app any it can be test or production doesn't matter.  I'll show you we added sign in with magic link but we don't like the look of it. So this is like a small side task if you can do it quickly it's fine or give us icons so you can see sign in with magic link if this is fine looks a bit off.  No, no, everything is fine you don't need to redesign anything here just you can test it of course if it works and so on but if you go back what I'm asking is maybe either another  icon or sign in when you blink. Yeah, that's the button and that's the new button. We just add it in there.  Either approve it from the design side or suggest something easier, but don't please don't spend any time on this or just like take 10 minutes and say, okay, let's move this button to the bottom or let's leave it or just put this icon instead of this one.  just something to do along the way if you can to help us because this icon is a bit off.  It's not perfect. So if you could just at least do something with it. I don't know. I'm looking for your input here, but lower priority doesn't spend too much time on it.  If you can take 15 minutes and just move it around or give us new icon, that's perfect. If not, let's leave it for now.

19:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll leave it for now as is.

19:48 - Ivan
  Okay. Okay. Fine. Yeah. That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay.

19:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's get to work. Thank you.

19:58 - Ivan
  you. Okay.

19:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow, bye-bye.
