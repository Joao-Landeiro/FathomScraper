0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi, Logan.

0:02 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Hey, how are you, man?

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you?

0:05 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Doing well. How do you pronounce your first name, by the way?

0:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's João. It's hard. João.

0:14 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  João?

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's it. It's a bit more nasal, but I don't think unless you're a native speaker or you have a clogged up nose, I don't think you can do it.

0:27 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Well, I kind of do have that. The latter.

0:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is it Brazilian? Yeah, I am Portuguese.

0:34 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  live in Brazil. mean, yeah, sorry.

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's good. It's good. But I am from Portugal, so that's confusing sometimes. I was born in Portugal, but I live in Brazil.

0:44 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Okay.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

0:46 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Nice. Well, hey, it's great to connect with you, man.

0:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, likewise. Sweet video setup, by the way.

0:52 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Oh, appreciate it. It started because I had a little bit of studio envy from a colleague. And so I've been...  Thank I've been building it up over time the last couple of years.

1:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, mine is not very impressive at the moment.

1:04 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I was just assembling some flatback furniture. Okay, nice, nice. Well, tell me a little bit about what you're up to.  Are you also in the Chris DuBois community as well as Agency Builders?

1:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, well, I mean Chris DuBois community, Agency Builders, is there another one?

1:26 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yes, we have a Slack and a Circle community. There's a paid level, but there's also a free level. You're welcome to join that one as well.  We've got probably 400 agency owners and marketing consultants in there. Could be a good group for you as well.  So lots of crossover between that group and Chris's.

1:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually, that's a question I have. So I'm somewhat new to the agency world because... It will all make sense in a minute, but it feels that, you know, when you start to research something, and at the start, like, everything is new, and eventually you start coming across the same references, and there's a lot of groups for agencies, right?

2:20 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Uh-huh.

2:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And how do you guys, like, this community just showed me that Agency Builders is your community, right?

2:35 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Agency Builders, yep.

2:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's your community. Yeah. How do you guys, like, differentiate and, you know, stand out? I'm intrigued. This is not a critic, right?

2:49 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yeah, no, no, it's a good question. I would say one of the biggest differentiators is that we have an annual in-person event, and a lot of the long-time members...  We hosted in Florida in March, which is usually a good time, especially for folks in different spots in the U.S.

3:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to get down.

3:08 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  And that's actually where the group started. So there's Agency Builders and then there's Business Builders. So Business Builders is the agency that Jay, our founder, started.  He was sitting around smoking some cigars or having a few drinks with a few other agency owners like four or five years ago.  And they're like, we should get together more often and swap notes and that sort of stuff. And let's host an event.  And so then they did the event and then the Slack community has grown. I'd say it's larger than some of them.  There's some others like Bureau of Digital that are larger and stuff like that. But there's probably like four or five hundred in the Slack community now.  And one of the things we've tried to do is that, you know, people, I think, don't necessarily want to pay for content, but they will pay for access.  And so we actually we Structured where there's a free level of the group, and then there's a $99 a month.  The $99 a month, you get discounts on the events. You get access to all the recordings from all the sessions for the past four years.  So instead of paying $1,000 to go to each event, you get all of that content. But to the access point, we do monthly Q&A calls with Jay and a few other veteran agency owners where you can ask specific questions and get some feedback on what you're facing and that sort of stuff.

4:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that sounds very good. Because I was checking out patterns in how agency leaders figure out stuff and express their doubts and their questions and so on.  And one of the patterns was, yeah, everyone is on social media, but their good questions show up in the closed groups, right?

4:52 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  And the much more vulnerable questions that they're interested questions people aren't willing to ask out in public, right? Yeah.

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All So that's very good. Okay, so I think it's fair that I introduced myself with a little bit more detail.  So what I do is that I create workshops for expertise businesses, right? Agencies, consulting firms. And I think the thing that made me connect with you initially, I think it was a comment.  And then from that comment, I was reading, like, there was a link to how you guys run webinars. Then I attended the webinar.  Because for me, although I don't think a webinar is exactly a workshop, I think that in people's minds, there's, like, a lot of overlap.  And one of the things I've noticed is that, so I come from the innovation consulting, design thinking kind of world.  And when you say workshop, everyone in that world knows what it means and have, like, kind of a set expectation.

5:53 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yeah.

5:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the agency world, I've noticed it's much more all over the place. People have different preferences about it. Yeah.

6:00 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  For instance, next Friday, Jay, our founder, is doing a two-hour workshop on AI, and we called it an AI workshop.  I mean, it's essentially a webinar. It's going to be some presentations and teaching and then some Q&A, right? It's not necessarily going to be like, you know, all that different from kind of the structure that we did on our webinar two days ago.  As far as overall, it'll be very different content, and it's going to be two hours long and that sort of stuff.  But I think that's kind of case in point of what you're talking about.

6:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, exactly. And I think one of the things that I'm noticing more and more with this, because before getting closer to the agency world, I'm still at the start of that journey.  I was closer to solo consultants, solo experts, and so on. And... And... And... What I've noticed is that it's a very interesting product to speak to.  I identify a lot with that because that's kind of what I am, but it's very difficult to get them to pay for things.  So I was like, I need to serve a public market that they have more than just curiosity. They have serious business issues to solve where workshops could work.  Have you run workshops besides the webinar kind of thing?

7:34 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  No.

7:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

7:37 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I mean, we, so I will say we would call them a workshop. At least I've started to actually. We do paid workshops that kind of begin our engagement at our agency.

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You tell me if this kind of fits the bill of what you're typically talking about in a workshop.

7:54 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  So people will come to our agency and say, we need a new website or we need help with this.  You know, or we need help with our meta ads, or we need help with content creation or blogging, whatever.  And we'll say, do you? We'll dig in and we'll say, well, a problem with a lot of marketing is that people jump into producing things and then promoting them.  And you're forgetting step one, which is the plan. And so we host workshops that we call blueprints so that you can plan before you start producing and promoting.  And so those usually cover three areas. We teach them a storytelling framework that we used to increase conversions on our own site.  Map out the seven parts of that framework for their specific business and build a brand script. Translate that into what that would look like on their website and build a plan to bring that messaging to life.  And go through some interactive stuff to determine kind of their design direction, preference, that sort of stuff. And then also audit their marketing and build them a 12-month marketing.  And so the idea is go through this blueprint process, and then we deliver a 15 to 20 page document to you, and you can either hire us to execute all of that, none of that, or you can take it and run it yourself.  And so it's usually like a three or four hour consultation, and then an hour long review meeting like a week later after we brainstorm and workshop together, we take it away, then we come back and kind of review the findings.  So we sell those, so it's a paid workshop kind of on the front end before people jump into ongoing services with us.  So that's my familiarity with workshops and what we would call and how we execute paid versions for our agency, for what it's worth.

9:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But from your description, you do things together, like there's a certain level of prompting them, getting their feedback, they make decisions in real time.

9:58 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Asking making decisions together. Some of the things we're bringing and saying, hey, here's the research we've done. Here's what we think.  Poke holes in this. Let us ask you some questions to formulate the other elements that we're putting together in the workshop.

10:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. I think that fits the build. I think the fact that there's an outcome, a tangible outcome, the document and not just the document.  There's probably specific parts of the document that is what they keep most present. And doing it together and mixing your expertise with their context, I think that fits the description for sure.

10:35 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Right.

10:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And OK, so for this, I just wanted to meet you and to understand a little bit more about this, what you're doing in terms of the webinars and that structure.  It's very clear that my objective objective here is really to understand how people think about this work of thing.  Yeah. seems that you have a decent definition of that. Is this the first company at which you do this kind of stuff, or have you done it at other ones, workshops and sessions?

11:09 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Workshops, yes. Yes. I've been in sales and marketing since 2008. I've worked as an in-house marketer. I've worked on multiple agencies, and both times on the agency side, I've kind of been in this role of where I'm marketing, which is why I'm running the webinar campaigns, hosting the webinars, you know, doing all of that.  But I'm also the salesperson as well. And so I've been in this sort of role multiple times, but having a paid workshop on the front end that we sell, this is kind of the first time.  And actually, I'm just now moving into where I'll actually be running those workshops. So previously it was, I would sell the workshop, then our founder or president would execute on that, and then they would sell the, you know, sell out of that.  Build a website, you know, run campaigns, whatever. Now I'm moving more into even more kind of full cycle from marketing to sales to the initial workshop delivery.

12:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

12:15 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Got it.

12:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And do you remember, like, when you first started participating in these sessions, if there was something that stood out to you, either in a good way or in a bad way?  Like, it's a different way of meeting with clients, it seems.

12:32 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yeah. I don't know specifically. Some of the questions that we get from clients are like, who all should be involved?  How many people should we be? Should we get involved? And we're having to coach them on kind of, obviously, there's no exact right number, right?  Oh, it should be three people. It should be five. It's, there shouldn't be too many. And there also shouldn't be too few.  Yeah. And we say anybody who can, who has veto power. Yeah. On anything that we're deciding together should be in the room.  Because the last thing we want to do is go through this two-week process, the initial workshop, the review meeting, we decide next steps, and then the CEO is like, nope, don't like that, that doesn't, right?  But also, especially with marketing, you don't want to do marketing by committee, because then everybody has an opinion, everything gets shoved in, and we're specifically talking about messaging and your marketing.  And simplicity is key, and simplicity is hard already, right? It's much easier. It's like that old saying, right? I would have written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have the time, right?  And so we're balancing that. We're also balancing, you know, when we deliver the Marketing Blueprint package back to our clients, kind of coaching them on how to socialize that internally and some of the pitfalls.  Because some of it could be like, hey, here's our... New brand script. And people are like, that sucks. Where's this?  Why aren't we saying that? And so coaching them on how to educate the team of where did they come up with this?  Who were the experts that helped craft it? What's the framework or methodology and why is that proven? And how do they frame these things of like, I'm not presenting this democratically to say everybody does this, right?  We're presenting this as a, you know, everybody get on board now, not just, hey, here's what it is, you know, accepted, but kind of coaching them on selling that, you know, internally, those sorts of things.  So those are some of the things I think about a lot when it comes to kind of this dynamic of working with clients.

14:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me. And I've heard other people describe it. But I think the detail it just gave me, it's really good.  Cool. Anything around this team that I could help you with just to retribute your kindness in giving me your perspective?

15:09 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I mean, I would say if this is kind of your area of expertise, if you have any advice or common pitfalls that you see, you know, agencies, consultants going wrong with running workshops with clients.  It could be the prep, which could mean your prep in research or your prep in how you set expectations, how you run them, or like we were just talking about, how you move people to action out the other side of them.  So if you have anything on each of those phases, I'm definitely open, whether that's, hey, this tweak kind of changes the game at this stage, or this is a pitfall I see a lot of folks falling into, and this is, you know, what I recommend instead to my clients.  I'm open to all ears for any of that.

16:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, for sure. So without much context, I think these are just maybe rules of thumb. Right. Most people, they tend to underestimate how much time the client will need to get on their wavelength during the workshop.  And so they often get these really ambitious workshops. And because if you guys have been running this for a while, I suspect you don't make this mistake anymore, but maybe you did at the start, which is getting like this super high value thing.  But at the end, you're rushing it because people, you know, you're almost at time.

16:45 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  People need to leave. So this is very common.

16:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The other thing is in the way that people sell workshops, oftentimes they talk about just the process, not the transformation.  Into this. this. this. In terms of preparation, one of the things that I think is interesting to do, and again, I suspect you do it, is as you adjust the structure of the workshop for the client, you have like this of the workshop, specific assets that are very easy to change, but the client feels very seen during the session, right?  They're like, oh, I don't know, maybe you put some facts and figures from their industry or something. And they're like, oh yeah, they understand me.  Towards the end, I think what you've described is just perfect, and if the client doesn't stick with you after the workshop, I would also assume, because you seem to be on top of your game, that you circle back like a couple of months later to see if the result has been applied.  Generally speaking, this is it, but I'm happy to give you more and more stuff. You have specific questions or like an event or a situation where you're like, oh, this wasn't perfect.

18:06 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  How would you do it? Yeah. Nothing springs to mind right now, but I'll definitely, you know, kind of knowing this is your expertise, especially as I get into delivering more of them, I will probably have some and maybe just fire away some random questions.

18:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, please. Yeah, for sure. For sure.

18:22 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Cool.

18:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Cool.

18:25 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Logan, I don't want to... I forgot to look. Were you on the webinar live on Wednesday?

18:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was.

18:33 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I was on the webinar.

18:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

18:34 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yes. Yeah. Any feedback for me? Do you feel like it was valuable?

18:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. I felt it was valuable, especially because... And I think this is like your, exactly your thing, which is not just getting people, not just running the webinars, because that's usually what I focus on, like running the workshop, right?  But there's this whole other thing. Which is filling up the workshop, which is like what you were explaining with the funnels and so on.  And I've read some books on funnels. They're not a new thing and so on. And people say they're dead, they're not dead, whatever.  Yeah. But just...

19:14 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Everything's dead or not dead these days.

19:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything, exactly. But seeing you showing that is always very valuable. I've been noticing that... I think this is obvious, really.  Because I think also because of remote work and so on, we don't see so much how other people work.  We just see their curated posts and things like that, like outside the communities. And then when people start sharing their screens and that as a level of richness, that's really, really good.  So also the frameworks, I'm a big fan of alliteration. So I like the frameworks.

19:55 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Thank you.

19:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

19:58 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I put some work into that. And tested some ideas off ChatGPT and stuff like that. And I was like, I don't know, is this going to be too cheesy or is it going to be helpful?  So, yeah, I appreciate the feedback. I'm a sucker for alliterations.

20:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. And I mean in the same boat as you are. Sometimes like, oh, I don't want to miss these alliterations.  This is so good. But it's like, is it cheesy? I don't know. I need to use it. Yeah, but I know the feeling.

20:24 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  I cross that line enough. I get eye rolls from my kids.

20:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, what do you want to do? Yeah, yeah.

20:33 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Awesome.

20:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, hey, it was great to meet you.

20:35 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Thanks for checking out the webinar. Thanks for chatting. If you want, you're more than welcome to join the free level of the Agency Builders community if it seems valuable.  I'm in Chris's community as well. So, if nothing else, I'll see you around in there and on LinkedIn for sure.

20:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you so much, Logan. Awesome. It was a pleasure talking to you. And thank you for how much you've shared around the area.  Experience with workshops and so on.

21:01 - Logan Lyles (Business Builders)
  Yeah, you bet.

21:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right, man. Have a great week. Thank you. Have a nice one. See you.
