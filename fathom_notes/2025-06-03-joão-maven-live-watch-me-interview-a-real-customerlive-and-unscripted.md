  Amazing. For folks that just joined, I'm asking everyone to just say what you do for work and where you're from in the chat.  You can all just appreciate the time zones that have come together. It constantly amazes me. I always am trying to find the sweet spot of time zones, but this feels like we've got a good mix here.  All right, I'm going to give folks 30 more seconds and then we'll get started. I'm very excited for today.  Also a little bit nervous, but I think that's, it's a good kind of nerves. Stephanie from Concord, West Concord, MA, Massachusetts, right?  Hi, Stephanie. Hi, Brittany. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to keep admitting people as they come in. Everyone can see my screen.  Green and hear me okay, yes? Thumbs up or give a nod, perfect. All right, so we are gonna watch, we do, an interview of one of you, someone in the room, and I don't have plans, notes, anything prepped, I will just be using my frameworks, and before we get into all of that, I do want to let you know that I will be opening the doors to my customer interview workshop at the end of this interview.  I've run it, this will be my fourth time that I'm running it in six months, it's in the best shape it has ever been.  If you follow me on LinkedIn, you've probably heard me talk my head off about this cohort. I'm bringing it up now because if you signed up for this webinar, you will likely be very interested in this cohort, and I'm offering a very limited, very I'm time.  So, to the first few folks that join. But I will be talking more about this at the very end.  I just want to give you a heads up in case you are interested so you know it's coming as well.  But let's get back to what you actually came here for, which is a real customer interview. So, I need a volunteer.  Somebody who is, A, interested in the fact that this is being recorded as OK sharing and has bought something that's like a common item in the past six months.  So, it's like fairly recent or recent enough. Ideally, something that you have bought online that you could maybe even like have a link to and drop it in the chat so I can see it like something from Amazon or a pair of shoes or something like a common item.  If you're interested in being interviewed, let me see a mention in the chat like anything that you bought recently.  like have Um, If that is something you're okay talking about, me asking you about, let me know, folks, in the chat, you can see by the fact that no one has answered yet that I have no one pointed, right, this is not, I have no one behind the scenes that I'm like secretly, hey, if no one says anything, you should join or someone that I'm pointing here.  So, I promise this will not be as scary as it maybe sounds, it's just going to be a casual conversation, and it's, it's going to take around 20 minutes or so, I want to give enough time to sort of like, okay, didn't explain a bit as we go, or even kind of after the fact, oh, nice, I have some willing participants, all right, I bought a $5,000 airfare by three weeks, so.  Airfare as in a ticket? Hugh, what do you mean by airfare? Nora, I can't remember anything I bought online.  Liz, I bought my son a 65 pound jacket. Sorry, go ahead.

4:13 - Hugh Alley
  It was a ticket.

4:15 - Hannah Shamji
  It was a ticket. Okay, like a plane ticket?

4:17 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah, plane ticket.

4:18 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, okay. Oh, and you didn't buy that online. Okay, interesting. Struggling to think what else I bought lately, Liz.  Scott, I purchased a two-year subscription to CRM. Hugh, what? Oh, you said you bought that three weeks ago.

4:34 - Hugh Alley
  Okay.

4:34 - Hannah Shamji
  Three months ago. Three months ago. Okay. Scott, when did you, Scott and Liz, when did you buy your, Liz, when did you buy your jacket?  Scott, when did you buy the subscription? I'm leaning a little more within the last six weeks. Okay. So, I'm leaning about a travel system joint, jointly with my partner for about 11 months.  One hundred pounds a couple of months ago. Okay. Online crafted, handcrafted scissors. I'm loving this. This is like such an array of purchase options.  This is amazing. How much were the handcrafted scissors, Sanya? I'm very curious. They were 85 pounds. 85 pounds?

5:25 - Stanya Petkova
  Yes, I bought them from the UK.

5:28 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Okay. So the reason I'm asking is like, I'm trying to find in order to do this interview effectively, I'm trying to find something that's a little meatier on the cost side and recency is helpful.  And also something that I have a little bit of context about that I can, that I can ask about.  So I'm not kind of starting from scratch. So that's why something, Scott, like the CRM is a little bit less tangible than like, I'm kind of leaning towards you.  a little bit Okay. Okay. The $5,000 airfare that you bought three weeks ago. Would you be up for me interviewing you?  Yes? Amazing. Okay, so what I'm going to do here, actually, let me just check. Could you, can you, well, can I get you to just say your name and your role?  And the only purpose is that I can make sure I can, like, hear you and our internet connections.

6:24 - Hugh Alley
  Good. I'm Hugh Alley. I am an industrial engineer and I interview people for when I'm doing plant design or plant process improvement.

6:37 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Amazing. Everyone was good with that. They could, everyone else can hear him as soon as I can hear him well.  I'm going to spotlight our videos so that we are center stage here. Okay. So, you'll see here I have.  see on you. Two pieces of paper, can't really see much of what's on it, this one is just a framework that I'm using to run the interview, nothing much, pretty much a line on a page, we'll get to that afterwards.

7:11 - Jaime Levy
  Perfect, thank you so much to do one.

7:13 - Hannah Shamji
  This is, this is like a 60 second, couple notes that I'll be running through in 60 seconds to kick off the call.  Other than that, I have nothing, so we're coming up this fresh, and I do want to write down the little bit you told us, you said a $5,000, and that's U.S., is that U.S.

7:36 - Hugh Alley
  dollars? Canadian dollars.

7:38 - Hannah Shamji
  Canadian dollars.

7:40 - Hugh Alley
  Half that.

7:42 - Hannah Shamji
  And you said airfare and three months ago, right?

7:46 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah.

7:48 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, amazing. Okay, are you good, ready to dive in? Amazing, well thank you so much for doing this. I know it's not, not an easy.  So I really appreciate you stepping up. I have nothing specific planned. I really just want to understand your story of like, actually making this decision, why you made it, how you made it.  I'm going to go into all of those nitty gritty. So just a casual chat here. No right or wrong answers.  Again, not looking for anything specific, just like your, your experience. Are you good for about like 20 minutes here?  Yeah. Okay. Amazing. And you're okay. The fact that this is being recorded, would normally ask before I hit record, but in the context of the webinar.  Okay. Amazing. I will probably interrupt you as we go multiple times. Sorry in events. The reason is if you say something I want to double down on, I might tug you back into that direction.  So just prep you in events. Hopefully that's okay with you. And if you see me looking down here, it's just because I'm looking at my notes, all the awesome stuff you're saying.  I'm going to make quick notes that I can jump back and like tug the conversation around. Any questions for me?  Anything sticky? Amazing. Okay. So, let's start from the absolute top here. $5,000 ticket. That's one ticket?

9:12 - Hugh Alley
  Two tickets. Me and my wife.

9:14 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. And you bought it three months ago, so that will put us in, if we're just in June, so like March, April?

9:22 - Hugh Alley
  Yep. March. Yep.

9:24 - Hannah Shamji
  Do you remember exactly when in March?

9:27 - Hugh Alley
  Uh, I'd have to go look it up, but it was, would have been earlier in March, I think.

9:34 - Hannah Shamji
  Earlier in March. Okay. And what makes you remember, remember the earlier? Was it like, uh, was there some kind of anchor in sort thinking about the timeline for our trip, and the planning process that we were going through.  Okay. So, earlier in March, you said you didn't buy this online.

9:53 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah. Where did you buy it? In the end, I bought it from a travel agent, uh, travel agent. agent.  when- I'd done a lot of looking online, but in the end, I bought it from a travel agent.

10:06 - Hannah Shamji
  And where are you based?

10:07 - Hugh Alley
  Where is the travel agency?

10:09 - Hannah Shamji
  I'm In Vancouver, okay. And this was like a single, like when you bought it, you were actually sitting in the travel agency and kind of paid in that specific moment?

10:20 - Hugh Alley
  out the credit card.

10:21 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. And so the ticket, so it's two tickets, and going where?

10:27 - Hugh Alley
  So we're going from Vancouver to Toronto, to Edinburgh, and then return from Heathrow, London Heathrow to Vancouver.

10:39 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Can we slow that down a little bit?

10:42 - Hugh Alley
  That's a very multi-city trip. Okay.

10:45 - Hannah Shamji
  So you're going from Vancouver to Toronto.

10:48 - Hugh Alley
  Toronto, to Edinburgh.

10:51 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay.

10:52 - Hugh Alley
  And the return is from London Heathrow to Vancouver.

10:57 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Wow.

10:59 - Hugh Alley
  And how long is this time? time? Three and a half weeks. Just got back a week ago.

11:04 - Hannah Shamji
  Wow. Okay. So the trip already happened.

11:07 - Hugh Alley
  Yes.

11:08 - Hannah Shamji
  Amazing. And you got back a week ago. So that was three and a half, this like, then the trip itself was three and a half weeks.

11:15 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah.

11:16 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Amazing. Amazing. Ah, I see.

11:18 - Hugh Alley
  That's why you were saying kind of the timeline. So you bought in March, but then actually went on the trip in May.  Exactly.

11:25 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. So let's get back to the pre. Like, how did this trip even come on the radar? this something that's been, you've been planning for a while?

11:35 - Hugh Alley
  Um, yes. So, uh, my wife and I have had two places we want to go in our travels.

11:44 - Hannah Shamji
  Uh huh.

11:46 - Hugh Alley
  She, we, travel has not been possible for us for a number of reasons until the end of last year, and then all of a sudden things opened up and we could choose.  We wanted wanted to. We wanted to go to the UK and to Australia and the first question was which one should we do first and we went back and forth but eventually we chose UK first because my wife has a cousin there who's 88 and she's not getting younger and so we thought okay let's go see her first.  Well, we know she's alive because we're not going to go to her funeral and and then build a trip around that.

12:36 - Hannah Shamji
  Can I ask what you mentioned you weren't able to travel until more recently. How long was that chunk of time?

12:45 - Hugh Alley
  Five years.

12:46 - Hannah Shamji
  So five years between COVID issues and then health care issues and then caring for ailing parent. Oh wow.

12:57 - Hugh Alley
  Sort of stretched. So there was No. No travel.

13:01 - Hannah Shamji
  Oh, wow. I see.

13:02 - Hugh Alley
  In that period of time.

13:04 - Hannah Shamji
  And so what happened in that, you mentioned December, that sort of changed the situation?

13:10 - Hugh Alley
  We were both healthy, and my mother-in-law died, and all of a sudden that responsibility went away.

13:19 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Wow. So that, and that kind of being healthy was also in cusp of your mother-in-law passing away, that was all sort of in the same moment?

13:29 - Hugh Alley
  We've been healthy for a while, but then my mother-in-law was just needing our care.

13:35 - Hannah Shamji
  Wow. Okay. And how long after, so when she passed, was this something that had kind of been on your radar for a while?  Oh, Yeah. Okay. And so then the planning towards that, when did that start happening?

13:49 - Hugh Alley
  We really started thinking about it in January.

13:52 - Hannah Shamji
  In January. Okay. And the conversation around that was, what did that sound like? Like if I'm there in the room.  And I'm sort of part of that conversation. What am I hearing you and your wife say to one another?

14:09 - Hugh Alley
  Um, we're, we're exploring the, the, which of these two options we should do first. And, and I guess it was, um, we've got people we want to see in Australia.  We have people we wanted to see family. We wanted to see in the UK. Um, and it was my wife saying, you know, maybe we should just go to the UK while her cousin is still alive and still got her help.  And we knew she had some health issues. So it was like, okay, let's do that one first.

14:55 - Hannah Shamji
  I see. I see. I see. the, the conversation of even. see. see. see. see. see. I think I'm curious about that like space of so your mother-in-law passed away and then the conversation of like hey we should maybe we should take our trip how did that come about was it something that was like we should take the trip because like look all of these pieces like we're in much better we're feeling much better or was it like a thing that you had kind of been inching towards in a conversation that had been happening all the time like did something happen that's triggered that initial conversation no I think we had been talking about where we would like to travel in road in our retirement years for some time okay my wife had retired three years ago and it was like what do we when we have the opportunity because we were looking at her mom's health but

16:00 - Hugh Alley
  We couldn't travel much, well, as long as she was around.

16:05 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, so you had been, this had been a conversation that started even more specifically of where to go before your mom-in-law had passed.  Okay, so then once she passed, there was a conversation of like, okay, well in January now, like, where do we want to go first?

16:20 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah.

16:21 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, and so once you started to have this conversation of like, well, maybe you should go to the UK first to visit your wife's cousin.  And what happened? Like, did you look, you mentioned earlier that you looked online.

16:34 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah, so actually the first thing that happened was that we were watching a TV program called Most Scenic Rivers of the World.

16:46 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. And... Is this like the first time you're seeing it or you've watched this before?

16:52 - Hugh Alley
  Well, it's a series that we've watched over time.

16:57 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay.

16:58 - Hugh Alley
  But this one was the... First time we saw one on the River Spey, and there was a fellow who was leading a canoe trip down the River Spey, which is in Scotland, and we've been canoeists for a long, long time, and it was like, hey, well, if we're going to go to the UK to visit family, we should do something fun that we wouldn't normally do, and so I got in touch with the guy who runs the company.

17:34 - Hannah Shamji
  From the From the TV program. Like, did you email them? No. Oh, that's cool. So you Googled and found the email and then contacted them directly?

17:44 - Hugh Alley
  Okay.

17:45 - Hannah Shamji
  Was this, like, same, like, next day?

17:50 - Hugh Alley
  Within a couple of weeks, within a week.

17:53 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, okay.

17:54 - Hugh Alley
  Okay. And so we sent the note off to him, and, uh, You know, one of the questions was, we're kind of thinking in May-ish, but do you have any trips planned in that time period?

18:11 - Hannah Shamji
  Ah, okay. But at this point, you knew you were going to the UK, but the idea of going to, like, because you ended up going to Edinburgh, that wasn't on the...

18:18 - Hugh Alley
  That wasn't on the...

18:20 - Hannah Shamji
  So that started once you saw this series, and then you contacted this company.

18:26 - Hugh Alley
  Exactly.

18:27 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. And then you hear back from them pretty soon after?

18:32 - Hugh Alley
  back from him, back and forth, about some details. Okay. Um, we were concerned about, um, there's a fair bit of whitewater on this trip, and we haven't done a lot of whitewater paddling.  Okay. Uh, so we wanted to know how much it was, how intense it was. Okay. Um, and he sent us back, uh, an email.  Iётen. Oh, Which basically said, look, most of the people that come here are close to novice, most of them are kind of 60 plus in age, so you're probably going to be in the ballpark of being able to do it.

19:19 - Hannah Shamji
  Perfect. Oh, that's great. That's great. And so the timing also worked out.

19:23 - Hugh Alley
  Mm hmm. Okay, so now we had a a trip that he was offering in the middle of May.

19:32 - Hannah Shamji
  Oh, okay.

19:33 - Hugh Alley
  And you already had May in your radar. We kind of had May in our radar.

19:37 - Hannah Shamji
  Was there a reason for that?

19:39 - Hugh Alley
  No, it was just knowing that we would need some time to plan what we were doing to get in touch with the cousin and her children and line things up and all the hotel stuff that we wanted So we just when you say line things up, you mean like kind of coordinate that you're coming and be.  Be able to see everyone. Yeah. Okay. And figure out where exactly we wanted to go in our non-family time.

20:10 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay.

20:10 - Hugh Alley
  That was totally open at that point.

20:13 - Hannah Shamji
  I see. Okay. But then in the end you planned the, so you went, so tell me about the Toronto piece.

20:20 - Hugh Alley
  Like what happened? How did Toronto come? Toronto is family from both of us and friends. And we hadn't seen anyone in Toronto for years because for the same reasons.  Okay. Right. And we thought that would be a really nice way to break up the time change.

20:43 - Hannah Shamji
  Ah, okay. But so this is becoming intentionally like a really kind of mammoth trip. Yeah. Okay. Nice. So what, when did the travel agency come into play?

20:55 - Hugh Alley
  What was, what was happening on this online search? What was happening is that. What was happening is that. So, early March, we kind of knew what we wanted to do in general terms.  Like the plan for the trip you mean? Yeah, so the plan was go to Toronto for a few days, go to Scotland, get there a few days before the canoe trip so that we could be on time zone, do the canoe trip, go down, visit some family, do some walking in the Cotswolds, do some more family, and come home.  So that was kind of the big trip. Okay, And we started trying to figure out, like your reaction was, oh, all this multi-city travel, right?  Right. The online systems just aren't really well set up to support searching for those kinds of things.

21:56 - Hannah Shamji
  How did you, yeah, how do you, like what website do You go to and did you look for like one big truck or were you trying to purchase separately?

22:08 - Hugh Alley
  We tried to do it as two legs, one there and one back.

22:17 - Hannah Shamji
  There being?

22:18 - Hugh Alley
  From, so from the Vancouver, Toronto, Edinburgh.

22:23 - Hannah Shamji
  And they just return on that.

22:25 - Hugh Alley
  Okay. And there's the return from Heathrow to Toronto or to Vancouver.

22:29 - Hannah Shamji
  Right.

22:30 - Hugh Alley
  But at that point, we weren't even sure, for example, whether we should fly to Heathrow and take the train to Edinburgh or whether we should just fly directly to Edinburgh.  And so how? I was looking online for possible, you know, flight combinations. So, you know, I went to WestJet and I went to Air Canada and I went to Expedia.  online at the The Canadian trio, and was just not getting patterns or combinations that made sense to us in terms of giving us enough time between flights and times and dates that we wanted.

23:27 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, so you had a loose, you had a stronger sense of dates at that point, and were you looking for like non-stop or specific criteria for the flights?

23:39 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah, so we wanted non-stop between the major points. Okay. We wanted some, we still wanted to figure out whether the Toronto to Edinburgh should be Toronto Heathrow train, or Toronto Edinburgh, and, you know, we were looking for direct Toronto Edinburgh flights.  Let's Let's Those didn't exist at the time.

24:02 - Hannah Shamji
  Ah, okay, okay.

24:04 - Hugh Alley
  And so then we knew that there are some super cheap fares, but when you're in England, so we looked at independently, I think it's JetBlue is the UK cheap airline, and to see what we could do, Heathrow to Edinburgh.  So we were looking at all these possibilities and just not seeing anything that we were happy with in terms of the timing.

24:43 - Hannah Shamji
  How long were you spending looking? Like, was there a period where it was...

24:50 - Hugh Alley
  The search was probably over a period of 10 days.

24:57 - Hannah Shamji
  10 days, okay. Yeah. And at that point... You keep like, so when I'm looking at flights, I'm like looking and then you have the timing, right?  And you kind of find something here and here, but doesn't connect.

25:08 - Hugh Alley
  Is that like multiple tabs open and sort of going and refreshing? Okay. Go at it multiple times and say, okay, well, how else can I do it and come back to it and try another website?

25:21 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Okay. Budget. What's budget like? Are you, are you trying to kind of fit everything into a certain amount or?

25:29 - Hugh Alley
  Or how, what are your thoughts around budget? Um, we knew that we were, we wanted to fly more than, uh, economy cramped on the way there because we wanted to be rested and, and ready for our trip.  And that includes like to Toronto and as well to Edinburgh.

25:52 - Hannah Shamji
  Yeah. Okay. So what did that mean?

25:54 - Hugh Alley
  What class? So we're looking at, uh, you know, it depends which airline it wound up.

25:59 - Hannah Shamji
  which airline it wound up. Being British Airways, I think it was Premium Plus is what it was called, kind of like a, what used to be called business class, you got wider seat, room, nice meals, okay, okay, had you traveled in that like premium, it's a premium plus it was, had you traveled in that before?  Not with BA, but in other business travel, I've done that. Okay, and did you take do that on the way back as well on the No, I weren't worried about it on the way back, because we were just coming home and we could sleep.  Okay, okay. So at what point was it then like, I can't find stuff online, let's go to a travel agency?

26:41 - Hugh Alley
  That would be mid-March.

26:43 - Hannah Shamji
  And what happened, like, what was the conversation that led to that?

26:47 - Hugh Alley
  The conversation, so the background is that my wife's mother had been a travel agent. Oh, we knew that they could do stuff for us and see things and...  And that we wouldn't know of.

27:04 - Hannah Shamji
  Oh, interesting. And so what was it that did that cross your mind to do a travel agency in the beginning?  Or you were like, no, I think we can tackle this on our own?

27:15 - Hugh Alley
  thought was, we can probably, we can at least understand how big the budget needs to be. We can learn about budget by doing some work on our own and maybe we'll find something.

27:32 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. And how'd you pick which travel agency to go to then?

27:36 - Hugh Alley
  We picked that travel agent because we had a friend who had used this travel agent before. Okay. we just said, great.  We actually had the name of a specific individual.

27:51 - Hannah Shamji
  Oh, phoned her and said, can we come and see you? Okay. So there was a point of like, we need to use a travel agency.  Let's contact. And so. Let's see who are our friends has used one before. Yeah. Okay. Then you find this person, call them.

28:06 - Hugh Alley
  So you did you call on the phone first as opposed to you didn't go in? Yeah, phoned and said, this is what we want to do.

28:12 - Hannah Shamji
  When can we come and see you?

28:14 - Hugh Alley
  Okay.

28:14 - Hannah Shamji
  we can be back and forth and it would be useful for us to be able to see her screen.  Okay. Okay. And this was still, this is still in March.

28:24 - Hugh Alley
  Yeah.

28:24 - Hannah Shamji
  Yeah. So you go in, what happens in that conversation? Like what criteria do you have already set? Do you have a clear budget set and you're telling her, like, what are the specs you're telling her that you need?

28:35 - Hugh Alley
  Um, the specs we're telling her is, uh, the basic trip outline of, uh, Vancouver, Toronto, Toronto to get us to Edmonton, Edinburgh, but whether it's through, you know, Heathrow plus train or direct is, we're open.

28:59 - Hannah Shamji
  fine. uh

29:02 - Hugh Alley
  And Heathrow to Vancouver, we'd like a direct flight, and we were within a day or two, like we had some flexibility on the start and end days.  So, you know, if there was a better choice, one day, plus or minus, we were fine with that.

29:25 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay.

29:26 - Hugh Alley
  And you mentioned, did you mention to her the premium plus and your budget? Yeah, we, we told her that we were looking for something that gave us some more space on the way there.

29:36 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay.

29:37 - Hugh Alley
  But not so we're concerned about it on the way back.

29:40 - Hannah Shamji
  And did you, did you give her a like, we want to keep within a certain dollar amount?

29:46 - Hugh Alley
  Um, I, no, I don't think we did. Okay. Until we knew what the range was going to be from our research, you know, we knew it was going to be in the 5,000 range.  Okay.

30:01 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Okay.

30:03 - Hugh Alley
  Okay. We weren't going to be, you know, this is a big trip. We weren't going to be fussed by whether it's $500 plus or minus.

30:11 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay. Okay. And how, in that same first conversation, you ended up booking in the end, or did you have multiple?

30:17 - Hugh Alley
  Nope. No. We, we did a first conversation and she, we got a certain point and she said, here's some things that I need to go look at and find, answer questions for you.  Um, so give me a few days and you think about, you know, we now knew, uh, that we had some flexibility about what our start and end days were, uh, and when exactly we traveled from Toronto to Edinburgh.  She said, you figure out those dates and then come back and we'll book it.

30:58 - Hannah Shamji
  How was that experience? experience, experience... next time. As you've gone from like 10 days of like doing this research on your own, it's like, you know, a huge map on the web you're trying to stitch together.  What's that experience like to go in and they're kind of like, I'm going to take this away and come back to you with some stuff?

31:14 - Hugh Alley
  We were fine with it. I was thrilled to not have to start wrapping my head around all the possibilities.  And she had narrowed it down because she'd figured out that WestJet-British Airways on the way there was a really good combination and that she'd also identified that British Airways had a direct flight from Heathrow to London or Heathrow to Vancouver for the return.  So that started being really appealing and price was totally competitive.

31:55 - Hannah Shamji
  How does the travel agency work? Like, is it an extra charge to see them or did they take a...  of something like how does that work they they pay you pay an extra charge and typically like a hundred dollars a leg oh on top of it so it's not like when you're meeting her it's when she books something and she books she gets a cot so I think it was about 200 bucks for us to in total yeah okay it's not more necessarily per ticket no okay okay okay I'm mindful of the time here but I want to ask I want to ask one last question here which is how many times did you go to that did you see them before you booked the final we saw her twice twice and in the second time we put out the credit card and how far apart were those two times um probably five or six days okay and so the she was gonna go away look at some stuff you you were gonna go

33:00 - Hugh Alley
  She to us, she got back to us, we had gotten in with our cousin just to confirm that those times would work for her, and...

33:12 - Hannah Shamji
  Oh, so in between those two meetings, you confirmed all the dates, went back, you had that confirmation, she got the details, so was that last meeting really just ticking off the boxes and then booking?

33:25 - Hugh Alley
  Pretty much, yeah.

33:26 - Hannah Shamji
  Okay, okay. I'm gonna pause it there, thank you so much for participating in this. Everyone can give like a virtual round of applause, it's never comfortable to bear your whole purchase journey to a room of like 60-some people, let alone to a smaller space, so thank you so much Hugh.  I really appreciate your patience and going with me through all of those, all of my nitty-gritty questions. It was fun.  Thank you so much. much. much. I'm going to take you off the spotlight here and I'm going to come back to my screen so we just saw what probably looked like a fairly normal conversation I think for everyone in the room we were just having a chat and I was understanding this purchase journey but that actually wasn't just a chat I was doing something very specific I was leading Q walking him along a timeline and this is how I run every single customer interview it's with something that I call the interview map and it's not a script or a list of questions it's a framework to navigate a conversation it has a start point it has an endpoint it has milestones along the way and my job as the
  SCREEN SHARING: Hannah started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/CYLizEbaHJDucwk8zuMswfyWYvus9XLS?timestamp=2050.085079  And interviewer, once I have, like, defined the right map that I need to use for that conversation, it's to unpack it with the customer, and that's exactly what we did with Hugh, we walked from the point of, like, first thought about this trip, all the way to the actual bringing out the credit card and making the payment, and we hit a bunch of milestones along the way that are kind of that middle of the map.  Does that make sense to folks, do you see how that kind of came to life in this conversation? This is a really important concept to understand, because most people think that interviewing is like understanding customer pain points, or like figuring out what customers want, or what do they think, or what do they care about, but actually good customer interviews are about unpacking a customer decision.  There are no exceptions to this rule, because as a business, you ultimately want to influence how customers behave, right?  You want to influence their decisions, so that you can Get them to decide in your favor. You want them to buy with you, to stay with you, to click your stuff, or to sign up for your stuff.  So you need to study their decisions in those interviews. But the thing about decisions is that they are never a single moment.  It is always a journey. It is always a timeline. There's no such thing actually as an impulse buy, right?  That decision, that action to take your wallet out and make the payment, that can happen in an instant. But there is so much trajectory that happened before.  Like we saw with Hugh. I mean, he took us back to December, but this conversation was much longer, had way, way deeper roots, right?  Everything that kind of leads you to this tipping moment where deciding to buy is actually the climax. It is the culmination of all of the forces that pushed in the direction of payment.  And this is the premise of the map. It's why the map works. And this doesn't just work for customer interviews.  It could be. Tire interviews, lead interviews, prospects, churn interviews, case study interviews, switching interviews, any type of interview, this can be the cornerstone of it.  I've had folks in my cohort even use this for the podcast interviews. The map is the cornerstone of what I teach in the cohort, and that's why I really wanted to feature this today.  It's also what is a powerful tool for the interviews, right? This cohort is going to be 90 minutes a day for three days, so not a big commitment.  An hour and a half a day for three days, and in that time, I'm going to show you exactly this framework, the interview map, and all of the trimmings that you need to prepare it and to execute it.  Because in order to run the map, you need some ingredients. You need to know how to build the right map and how to get good data, what good data is, how to have clear goals to be able to spell out your map, and that's what we do on day one.  Day two is then, how do you actually use the map to guide the conversation, to steer the conversation? How do you keep someone on the  What does that mean? How do you structure the conversation so it flows without it feeling like too rigid? And then day three is real-time movement as a skilled interviewer.  How do you build the instincts and the fluency to actually pivot? How do you dig deep? How do you skip ahead when it doesn't matter?  How do you listen and lead the conversation with intention? Because the map will not do the work for you.  You need to actually do the work to bring the map to life. I really want to emphasize this because this is not, again, specific to interviews.  In fact, most of the folks who join my cohorts are, sorry, not specific to customer interviews. Most of the folks who join my cohorts are a bunch of different roles.  I've had a founder, case study writer, product marketer, head of product, head of sales, director of customer success. I've even had a software solutions engineer from Amazon in the last cohort.  had an HR leader from Cisco. They This timeline concept, it transcends the nature of the interview, and I want to share a last thing with you, because this is not something that takes forever to learn, this is not a theory-only workshop, it's actually a very, very practical, hands-on workshop, and I actually just had M.  Thomas, this is a lovely picture of her, she joined my last cohort and she sent me this voice note a couple of days after the cohort finished, and I I played it for my husband right away, it's like 30 seconds, I was so nervous, because I thought like, is something wrong, did something not go well, did she, you know, did something, did she get stuck on something, but she actually shared this, I'm gonna play this, if I play this first thing, you guys, tell me if you can hear it.  I just have to tell you, I've... Can you hear it? Okay, cool, I'm gonna play it. I just have to tell you, I got off of a customer interview that was, like...  She revolutionized by the timeline concept. I felt like it was so clear. My questions were better. She felt safe.  And honestly, I revealed at the beginning that we were just going to be moving across the timeline. And so it wasn't uncomfortable to shift to new spots.  And it was really seriously awesome. She then offers to do a video for me, and she does a video, ends up doing a video testimonial for me.  But I just loved the rawness of this one. So I thought I would play it for you. So this is very practical, very learnable, hands on workshop.  We will, of course, my background is in psychology. I'm a former therapist. So we will, of course, cover psychology theory, the psychology of conversation.  That is the baseline of this interview map. But there's going to be exercises, group practice. It's not going to drag on for days.  I'm a huge fan of like deep learning done fast, which is exactly what this is. it's designed to be.  It's Now, I do want to keep it intimate and personal because I do give feedback to everyone, so I'm keeping this round to only 20 spots.  The first five who sign up will have $250 off with the code EARLYBIRD. The price is in US dollars, in case I had some folks in the past assume that I was charging in Canadian because I live in Toronto.  But no, I don't. I charge in US dollars. And I'm just trying to send this to folks in the room.  I'm trying to drop this in the chat so you can have a link. But it's not letting me. Hmm.  Oh, there we go. Doors are open for the next two weeks. So if you want to see if your manager can pay for it.  If you can expense the course you can also pay for it and send a receipt to them there's actually a button underneath if you see in the link there's a get reimbursed button and it has a template of an email that you can use or if you want to send the receipt along or to sort of float it by a manager you can do that as well but I will be talking about this over the next couple of weeks so you can get a good feel and flavor for it but again the spots are limited the site will actually close once it's hit 20 spots so you won't be able to purchase it will just throw you on the waitlist so if this feels like something you're interested in I really hope you join I hope you got a lot of value out of today to thank you Hugh for participating this was a lot of fun it was really exciting to get to know I've ever actually used the travel agent myself but now when I think about multi-city trips it's a it's nice to know there's a less stressful option out there and thank you so much for you  Thank participating everyone, just here at time, and I will be sending this out as a recording, you'll get that shortly, and I hope you all got something valuable from today, and thanks for your time.  I'm seeing Stephanie, what if you can't make the class, so all of the, you mean, I'm assuming you mean the cohort, if you can't make the dates, it is all recorded.  I do suggest it's, like, if you can attend live, it's better, I will be running it again, so you may want to wait for a future, a future iteration, but this is the sort of, like, blessing and curse of it being live.  Sometimes you can't make it, and if you can, there's a lot more to be able to get out of it, but everything will be recorded.  I have had folks who were able to join for one of the recordings and not the others. If you can even catch up in between and be able to do some of the exercises, because there's also a chat for that week, so you can learn from others as well.  Thank can So you can participate async as well, but it's always better if you can join live. Amazing. Thank you so much, folks.  Again, you'll be getting the recording and a link to this later today. And thanks for sticking around. Have a good day, everyone.  Bye.
