0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But apologies. Can you hear me? I can hear you, yes.

0:07 - JR Lay
  Good, good.

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can hear you as well. It's joaol.

0:10 - JR Lay
  Am I pronouncing that correctly? Joaol?

0:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. It's hard, but you were doing a very good job. Well, let me hear it in your tongue.  Fine. So, joaol. Joaol.

0:23 - JR Lay
  Yes. Joaol.

0:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joaol. Yeah. Joaol. Got it.

0:29 - JR Lay
  Very good.

0:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very good. I will do my best. It's good to see you. Good to connect. Good to see you. Also, thank you for being open to it.  Well, I don't want to take too much of your time, so let me give you a little bit of context, and then I have some questions to run by you.  Please. So, I help experts create their own workshops. That's the thing that I do. And what I've noticed is that I need to get a little bit more clear.  Who they are, where they are, how to talk to them, and so on. I'm at that stage where the referrals are dropping up, and now you need a structured marketing approach.  So people told me I should be interviewing both the ICP and people that know my ICP. And I think you know my ICP really well, or this hypothesis of an ICP.  And basically the main points that I have, and I'll go through the questions, but the main points that I have is how do people that have their own expertise, and they could do something with it, they could put it out, how are they thinking about it, and how and if workshops fit into that.  So I took a look at your profile, at your journey of, you know, marketing for financial services, selling the invisible, I think it's really a good forcing function.  Get, you know, tight on the, on those principles. So, so I think I'll learn a lot from you. How does this feel?  It feels good.

2:11 - JR Lay
  mean, what, had I had someone like you 10 years ago, it would have saved me a lot of pain, heartache.  I mean, I've studied this. I've built probably three or four really good workshops. Like I was up in Canada yesterday.  Yes.

2:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're doing what you're talking about doing.

2:37 - JR Lay
  It's $10,000. I go up very mental prep. I pretty much prep on the plane. I get there. I print the workbook out.  They get the workbook and, and then I facilitate it. So it's, it's an initial engagement. I call a team alignment workshop.  So I've. Two businesses. If you go to my, I call it my legacy business, digitalgrowth.com, you'll see team alignment workshop.  That's how this is being positioned and sold. And I think we're about to increase the price to 15,000 for the workshop just because I'm more interested in the business that I'm creating.  My second business that is now 90 days old, which is working very similar to you with other B2B entrepreneurs to help turn video content into bestselling books.  And one of those stages actually, so it's three stages. It's to help them unlock and capture their unique wisdom.  So there's another workshop. We start with a unique wisdom workshop, which helps them to clarify what their wisdom. Their perspective, essentially their expertise is.  And our methodology is unique wisdom equals their unique perspective multiplied by their unique methods. So the unique methods are what to begin to visualize systems, process, framework, the perspective that they have gained through their lived, learned, and shared experiences.  And the unique wisdom is something that no one else has. And you can't get this in a large language model.  So that's the unique wisdom workshop. So that's where we unlock and capture that. We then do the 12 video recordings.  I've interviewed now probably 500 podcast episodes with people. And so one of the things that I've learned about myself is people were always saying, Oh my gosh, that was one of the best podcasts.  So I didn't realize it was a gift. So I said, well, why don't we take that and turn that video content as the foundation for their book?  But then also we have all that video that becomes the foundation for their content engine. So being able to multiply all of that back out into the world, once again, this is from my own lived experience.  I've written two bestselling books. And I think working with other publishers, the frustration was, great. You wrote the book.  Now you're on your own. I'm a marketer. I've been doing this for 23 years. So I was like, I can go and do this myself.  But I have a lot of empathy for other entrepreneurs that want to do this. They write the book and they're like, now what?  Because the third step, so you have unlock and capture, publish. The third step is amplify. And it's the amplification.  One of those. And we're about to launch our new. Market in July, because we got some good market feedback ourselves, that amplification, one of those areas is workshops.  So being able to take all that content, that wisdom that we have now captured through that round of interviews, I don't necessarily want do it myself.  I would prefer to find other experts that this is what their unique ability is and then be able to pull that team together.  And we're providing, we're orchestrating that brand experience because the whole reason we're doing this to begin with in the first place is to help other entrepreneurs elevate their brand, increase their influence so that they can level up their revenue.  So just showing you how my thinking is aligned with your thinking.

6:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so much. It's eerie. Like the way I came into the whole workshop thing as a business. Here was very much related to this knowing things is not really a moat.  So now the experience of, you know, interacting with you, going, you know this, you do this, you leave this, but really, it really, really spoke to me.  And sometimes people share like parts of the perspective, but I think the overall app, like it's insane, which is very confidence inducing for me because your experience on this and that's great.

7:30 - JR Lay
  I want to roll back to something that you just shared that I think it's important to pause and ponder just a bit.  You mentioned knowing things is not enough anymore. Why? So there's different ways of knowing, right?

7:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And knowing like book smarts, let's say. So that's not a moat because I can just learn things with ask questions to the LLMs and so on.  And maybe this happens to you, but sometimes I'm talking to clients and they know I see their eyes shifting to the  Tab where they have chat GPT open and they're like cross-checking things as I say them, right? So this is a level of the erosion of competitive advantage of just having a lot of experience and knowledge and book smarts.  It's immense. So that's my feeling on that.

8:26 - JR Lay
  Are you on WhatsApp? Yeah.

8:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I live in Brazil. Everyone is on WhatsApp. Yeah.

8:31 - JR Lay
  Well, I was going to say, what's your number on WhatsApp?

8:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or can I just search you? I can send you via LinkedIn. Can I do it? Yeah. think it's probably easier to be a bunch of numbers.

8:45 - JR Lay
  Because it'll be easier because I prefer to get out of my LinkedIn DMs because it's just a mess. I think the organization of DMs is horrible.  They should make it more like a true inbox as much as I travel. But I want to... I want to send you something.  It was an interview that I did. And we were talking about the wisdom economy. So what you're talking about, I think knowledge is commoditized.  I think knowledge is commoditized. The knowledge economy, the knowledge worker is dead. Wisdom, though, because if you think about like the, have you ever seen the Pyramid of Knowledge?  It doesn't ring a bell, no.

9:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is that from Joe Hudson, the article?

9:33 - JR Lay
  No, I don't know. Like this was something that I found whenever I was writing Banking on Change. So my second book, and basically it's at the foundation is data.  Let me see where I find it. Pyramid of Wisdom. I'll send you a picture of it, but it's these different levels.  Oh, here it is. It's data. It's the D-I-K. Bye. W model. It's data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. And the top, the pinnacle, the wisdom, it's what you're talking about, the workshop.  That's the application of knowledge. And so when you take someone through a guided experience, you're not just applying your knowledge, you're helping them also get that and apply the knowledge almost instantaneously to get faster feedback loops.

10:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so the distance between the insight and the application is really short. And I like the fact that you said guided experience, because when people don't have a familiarity with workshops, that's usually part of the definition I use.  And anyway, it's just so contemporary, right? Like you, like someone has subject matter expertise on one thing, but then the client is the subject matter expert on their context, right?  So If you need to, if you're going to apply it there, you need to do it together. I mean, I don't need to convince you on this.  No, no, because I'm doing it.

11:07 - JR Lay
  Like, I've been doing this. I started doing this, I think, well, I've been speaking on stages for about 20 years at this point.  I really started to focus and build a workshop skill, and it is a skill. Yeah. 2014, we hosted our first workshops in Houston where they were team workshops, and I think that's just something to consider, too, as you're bringing your ideas and your wisdom to bear.  I started with cohorts and groups to get feedback, and then from there, I used that feedback, and I did it the wrong way.  We built three workshops. Stupidest thing to do. A lot of time and a lot of energy, and we were losing money.  But what we were getting was wisdom. So I was okay losing dollars to get feedback because I knew that that was going to go into my next iteration.  And so people would pay to come to Houston. And we had people coming in from Europe even. And this is all in the financial services space.  And then that led to packaging all of that up. We went into the virtual delivery of workshops. So we experimented with that.  We went into the on-demand side of things, which don't recommend that. The follow-through is abysmal. But what I do recommend, though, is once you start developing this IP, and it's almost like you start with the core workshop, and then how do you take that core workshop and then create courses?  applybook-up紹介, And what I mean by courses, though, because the course is, it can be delivered on demand, but then you support that with some sort of group coaching.  That has been very profitable because you're not having to go and repeat yourself, you know, a thousand times, record it once, deliver it on demand.  But then you support that cohort with the coaching and the facilitation. And I think that's the big skill of what makes a great workshop is the facilitator.  You don't have to know all the answers. For sure. You just have to know the right questions to ask to start the conversation.  So how can I help you, dude? Because I'm so glad that you're doing this. What can I do to be of service to you?

13:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I mean, already being super helpful in giving that perspective of someone that has been through this. So, let me organize my thoughts here.  So my initial intention was to ask you more about, you know, the people that you serve, so I could see how, you know, workshops fit into their world.  And then we entered this bit of the conversation, which was amazing, about like your own personal experience with workshops.  And what I'm thinking now is my challenges with selling workshops to experts, I think they are on maybe two fronts.  One is awareness. A lot of people don't really know what workshops are or have like this HR, cringy, team-building ideas of workshops.  And they see them like adult daycare, not really a way of working together. So that's a challenge I have.  And part of the research is to find like the hooks where I can drop into the conversation and change the way people think about this.  And the other one was a bit more, let's say, existential, was like, is there a market in this? I think there is.  I mean, it's kind of impossible that there isn't, but I think the way I'm talking about it, which left the need of doing research, still is a bit on that, you know, let me tell you about how to run a workshop.  And I think if people are not at that stage, this just flies over them, right? So to answer your question, sorry, I babbled on a little bit.  No, no, no, you're fine. I think, yeah, put me in contact with more people that you think could have good insight so I could interview them.  That would be amazing, for sure.

15:44 - JR Lay
  Max Traylor.

15:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I've spoken to Max, yeah, love his stuff, yeah. Max Traylor, Steve Patti. Steve Patti? Steve Patti.

15:56 - JR Lay
  I just had him on the Level Up Business podcast. Um. And he would probably be able to give you some perspective of this as well.  I mean, he's been... And who would be your ideal buyer, do you think?

16:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I have two working, maybe three working hypotheses right now. The first one is like solo experts, people that are living in corporate and so on.  So feels almost a B2C kind of business. It feels that I need to have a huge surface area to capture it.  And I'm unsure about that, especially now with organic being really bad. The other one was agencies. And I'm coming to terms with the idea that some agencies do have their own unique ways of doing things, but a lot of them do not.  A lot of them are just, you know, kind of body shops. So they would not value the whole productize into workshops thing.  And the third one is boutique consulting firms, right? So where expertise is more relevant. And I think my challenge with that is my prospecting muscle is not very developed yet.  So I still struggle to find them. But this feels like a skill issue that is easy to fix. It's not a structural thing.  So these are the three main directions. The people I enjoy the most talking to are the first ones, of course.  Individual subject matter experts are always fascinating people to talk to. But they tend to be very curious and high agency.  So they're like, oh, yeah, I'll learn that. And then they just go and get a book, right? And I'm leaning towards like someone that has a bonus attached to the outcomes and helping them with some business development on the team.  Consulting firms and stuff like that. That's how I'm thinking about this.

18:04 - JR Lay
  Can I give you some very fast feedback?

18:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, please.

18:09 - JR Lay
  So I think your point on solos, yes, you need a large surface area. However, that could be a one-to-many offering.  Got it. I do think there could be a community aspect to that. Bring together a cohort of 10, charge them some type of shared number.  It's kind of a done-with-you approach, but it's done in a communal format. And there would be support, too. Because I think, how are you packaging this?

18:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a very meta thing, right? So what I've been doing is I've been doing work sessions, like 90-minute work sessions to create a structure.  I'm sure for a workshop, maybe four to six sessions, and we, like, the thinking behind it is, like, where does the workshop fit into your business?  So not workshop for a workshop's sake. Is this, like, for a client acquisition thing? Is for, like, deepening a relationship?  to solve complex problem? Based on that, we look at what things they have done in which they have, you know, real experience.  So an example of a bad choice. Oh, I want to get in on AI. I want an AI workshop.  I don't think that's a good choice if you do not have experience with AI, right? And so we see where they have the experience and the unique perspective very much aligned to your way of seeing things, and we shape one interaction around the workshop, right?  The way we build the workshop is we think about which outcome we want to create for the client, and we walk back from it, like, what kind of questions, and...  What shifts do we need to make in their minds to get to that outcome? With that, it's not really a recipe, but it's an ingredient list.  We need these ingredients. We figure out which activities make most sense for that. And the main idea is together time is really expensive.  So we don't want to use together time for basic information gathering. We want together time for reflection and decision making.  And what has been difficult in packaging this is that some people, they need more time. I think this is also a skill issue in terms of me qualifying the clients.  Some clients are more ready. But as I run this, I can see the green flags easier. So that's the thing.  And at the end, you have a workshop. You have the assets for the workshop. And you have like a guide or a script or a roadmap.  And we do it together once so people feel a bit more comfortable. And that's it. That's how I'm doing it now.

21:10 - JR Lay
  I'm even, just the way my mind works, I can see opportunities here that if I may, I don't want to overstep my boundaries though and like give you ideas that are just dumb, that are worthless, that you're not going to use.  I think you're really onto something though. So your solo experts, yeah, you can do one to me. Your agencies, yes.  I guess the question is, they don't know they need a workshop. I'm not at my office right now. I probably have 10 books for workshopping that I've had to like just learn over the years myself.  now. Be I Let's But we, Thank you. But for example, is there a way to stop talking about the workshop?  Because that's your how. What do they need? And if you take every business down, they need three things. They need brand.  They need awareness. It's the top of the funnel. They need demand. So call it the 95.5. Like the brand's the 95.  The demand's the 5% that's in market ready. And then they need to expand their relationships. So it's almost like there are three types of workshops that you could associate back to the client need.  Don't talk about the workshop. That's the how. The why is, well, what do you need? You're already asking the question.  But I think from a positioning standpoint, even with you, it's like we can get you more awareness. Because they could almost do the exact same thing.  It's like you could bring a cohort together. Could you go out and get 10 solos or 10 agencies and say, I'm trying to figure this problem out here.  I need some help validating it. Like, I'm looking for 10 to come through a 90-minute session. You're going to walk away with X, or...  It's almost like you're prospecting with your own process.

23:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

23:32 - JR Lay
  Have you tried that at all?

23:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I haven't tried that in a structured way, no. So I dabbled with it, but dabble is a bad way of doing these things.  So what's holding you back then?

23:46 - JR Lay
  What's the big problem for you?

23:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this conversation has been really good because you... I sense the confidence you have in this approach, this perspective.  So that's amazing. And I think that was my biggest challenge. Like, am I on something? Because sometimes I get interesting reactions and then like maybe the content doesn't really generate interest.  I think a lot of it is just me not having a lot of miles into this whole marketing expertise thing and probably having like distorted benchmarks on what is a good signal, you know?  So why don't you do this?

24:35 - JR Lay
  Why don't you run your little benchmark? Have you connected with Pete Caputa?

24:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Always from that box, I think. I don't think I've connected with him now.

24:46 - JR Lay
  Let me connect with Pete and let me connect you with Steve.

24:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

24:54 - JR Lay
  Because I think, you know, once again, having your own benchmark data. And also, too, that's another solution. Because if you're going to do a workshop, benchmark data for a workshop just creates the validity of the workshop exponentially.  mean, it's like, so it's like, how do you help them? It's almost like, where do they need a workshop?  At what stage of the buying journey? Is it brand? Is it demand? Is it expand? You unlock their wisdom for that particular workshop.  How package that? How do you go to market with that? And then how do you take, how do you help them pick the benchmarks to make the workshop even that much more valid?  Because I think, for example, like, it's like winning with workshops. It's like win without pitching from Blair Enns. Um, we're about hues we're we're thing.  Um. I I don't pitch, dude. There was a client the other day, a prospect, a legacy client. They were like, you're one of three people that we're looking to do to help us with this thing.  And I got on a 15-minute call with their entire executive team. And I'm like, they had five questions. And I was like, number one, I don't pitch.  I don't present. I said, I'm going be fully present with you. Just have a conversation. Are you okay with that?  Yes. I just ask a lot of questions. And I said, every question that you want answered, what's the problem with all of this?  They couldn't answer. I go, the problem is, is you're looking at this as an external problem. Because they're looking for acquisition.  I go, you can go to the market and go ask all the questions. You're not going to fix that problem until you fix the problem internally first.  And that's why we start with the team alignment workshop. They're like, wow, that's so different. That's so different than the other two.  I go, I I'm not for everyone, but. I guarantee you, either you're going to work with me, and I'm going to make you feel very uncomfortable, and you're going to change, or I'm going to work with you, and nothing's going to change, and you're going be in the exact same place you were before.  It's your choice. And I was like, so how does all this sound? It sounds very interesting. So should we book?  Should we get the schedule? And they're like, well, we see the two other people that we need to talk to.  I go, I know them. They're great people. If you want to do something different, I'm a If not, go look for the other two.  So my point is, yes, I have the validity of doing this myself, and I'm even happy to be like, we haven't worked together, but just to say, hey, this guy, he's done this stuff.  And if there's someone like a prospect that you need me to talk to even, too.

27:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Wow, that's incredibly generous. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, that's why.

28:00 - JR Lay
  I'm moving my business to level up business. My focus for growth going forward, I'm so not interested in my past.  I'm done with it. Bankers, credit unions, they are not growth oriented. I have to work with other entrepreneurs. And however I can help these, like you, however I can help you level up, dude, if it's talking to a prospect and just telling my story, I'm happy to do that.  You gave me a lot of ideas.

28:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're going on the second season of my podcast. I mean, you're invited for sure. It's a small one. It's like my mom and my neighbors watching.  But it's exactly about this. So just to give you context is it's really to answer that question. It's like knowledge work has changed.  What are the different ways of, you know, framing, positioning, presenting knowledge work in which that keeps the edge of it, like the value?  I'll send you a link just so you can check it. Have you ever thought about SaaS? As a market?  Yeah. Not much. Why does the idea come to you?

29:14 - JR Lay
  I think because of the way that B2B SaaS is being bought and sold and how that's changing now and how it's going to continue to change.  I feel like the idea of knowledge, wisdom, expertise is going to have to be injected into that buying process.  Because there's a lot of pitching that goes on, but if that was done in more of a workshop style format and perhaps even charged for that, there's more perceived value to the thing.  Because you might come to the end of the conclusion and say, hey, we're not the best fit, but I recommend you go talk to A, B, and C.  That's a huge differentiator right there.

29:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There are some guys. There That I think are a perfect example of what you're talking about. Their company is called Double Loop.  Do you know it? Super Nerdy is about, like, creating visual maps of metrics and strategic maps and stuff like that.  It's super nerdy. And the thing is, I think it disaligns precisely to what you're saying.

30:23 - JR Lay
  If you're going to use that solution, it says something about the way you manage your company.

30:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, the philosophy you have to run your company. It's not just about getting some software and, you know, it's not Notion.  Correct. So, they're... Go ahead.

30:40 - JR Lay
  Buying Notion or buying a lot of these things today is such a transactional experience. Yeah. Yeah.

30:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And in this case, like, when you're hiring the company, the Double Loop guys, you're getting, like, operating system organization for the organization.  Like, how people think about metrics. Go ahead. How metrics are injected into every conversation, stuff like that. So actually, their tech demo is a workshop to see what that kind of way of working means in the context of your company.  They're not very big, but I think it's exactly what you're saying. I think it's the bleeding edge of past the tools and the systems.  There's a philosophy crystallized into code, right? Well, you're saying some very important words.

31:34 - JR Lay
  Tools, you can't sell tools anymore. Tools are commoditized. You don't want to sell transactions because there's no value. So what are we left to sell?  And it's one other T, because this is just how my mind starts putting patterns together. The thing to sell is a transformation.

31:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the transformation starts.

31:59 - JR Lay
  And With a workshop, by helping a prospect or a client, depending on where you are in that journey, see a bigger future that they are not able to see just yet.  Once you help them see that future, then it's much easier to create that future together. I don't know. I'm riffing right now.  Based upon stuff that you're giving me. For sure.

32:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  sure. And also, you know the idea of coordination problems? So there's people that study problems, and there's families of problems.  I'm not familiar with this.

32:48 - JR Lay
  This is really interesting.

32:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So some problems are called coordination problems, which is just getting people to do the same thing. Like politics is a coordination problem.  Uh-huh. And something that... It's super nuanced, but I found it fascinating, which is like everyone is using ChatGPT now, right?  And ChatGPT is becoming individualized for each one of us. So it always agrees. It's very annoying that anyway. I'm like, disagree with me, damn it.  Yeah, but most people are not like that. Most people love that the computer agrees with them, right? So what this generates is like everyone that you work with, they have an invisible conciliary that you know nothing about.  And that was fine-tuned to tell that guy that that guy is right, right? And everyone is talking to this conciliary all the time.  This makes coordinating like complex things really difficult because the half-life of that feeling of, yes, we're in this together is really short because you have the meeting, everyone agrees.  The guy opens ChatGPT and ChatGPT will pull him back to his previous opinion, right? And this It's invisible. You don't know that this is happening.  You know this is happening, but you don't know how, right? So coordination problems, I think they'll just increase. It's just actually that's what we saw.  Politics got  up because everyone could share an opinion, which is great. At the same time, it's very difficult to converge on like specific lines of action that we can kind of agree.  Now it's just chaotic, right? Anyway, I think this connects with what you're saying with start with the alignment, right?  Of course, you must start with the alignment because these guys, they don't even know how far ahead, how far away they are from each other and pointing at every direction.  So, I don't know. just, it's not, I have a lot of conversations, a lot of conversations. It's not always that I feel so much sync in like worldview.  So I might be nerding out a bit on this. Sorry.

  It's all good. It's a great way for me to end my week because I took a red-eye home last night from Vancouver to Houston.  We didn't leave until 2.30 a.m. Houston time. We landed at 7 a.m. Houston time. I haven't slept, so you're getting me on about being awake for 30 hours right now.  And so I love this because it does. It raises my energy because I do believe that, for example, workshops, they're an exchange of energy.  I like that. Workshops are, and I saw this yesterday. I'm working with this executive team, $10 billion institution, and there was one person in the room who wasn't vibing.  And I basically was like, fire that guy. Because I just know from his energy in doing this, you know,  He's going to drag everyone else down. So I'm even like being able to spot those patterns pretty quickly now.  And I'm like, and I frame it like this in our closeout discussion. I could be wrong.

  I've been wrong before.

36:18 - JR Lay
  But this is what I see. This is what I recommend. And yeah, there's workshops are an exchange of energy.  And there are two types of people. I learned this from one of my mentors, Dan Sullivan. He says, you have people who are batteries included.  And you have people who are batteries not included. I'm doing everything possible in my life right now to exit batteries not included people.  I only want to be around batteries included people. Because it is a mutual exchange of energy. We're adding, you're adding, I'm adding.  And they can sit. And I think too, when you show up to conversations, the faster you can feel people's energy, the faster you can identify them.  Are they a right fit prospect or not? Because I think there's something to that. Because if they don't see a bigger future for themselves or for their organization, regardless of the workshop is secondary to a lot of these subsets here.  Dude, I could talk to you all day. mean, seriously, this is good, man. I'm so grateful that we were able to connect today.  I got a couple of things. I'm going to text or WhatsApp you. follow up over the next week or so.  But seriously, use me as a resource.

37:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I will. I will. If I can help you in any way. I'm very happy that we got to talk.  I am too.

37:48 - JR Lay
  I am too. And Joao?

37:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joao. Start over here. Joao. Joao. Joao. Joao. Joao. Joao.

38:00 - JR Lay
  João, I will do my best. Names are important to me, that's why. It might take me a few times, but I will continuously improve for you.

38:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you, thank you. Well, this was amazing, and thank you so much. It gave me a lot to think about.  Also, some very actionable stuff. Anyway, yeah, I could talk about this for hours. We'll talk again, for sure.

38:23 - JR Lay
  Before we break, let me ask you this. You took notes just off the top of your head. What's the number one thing that you're seeing right now?  Like, what's the big insight from this conversation? What's the big idea, the big insight that you're walking away with?

38:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on a very basic level, workshops make sense. So this was very confidence inducing. They make sense for it.  It's not like I'm not crazy to think that they make sense. And then more specifically. big insight. insight. The way to connect, like, at which stage do you need a workshop for, like, the brand, the demand, the expand, that's also a very useful language for me to think about this and connect to what people are already thinking about, like the problems they're feeling.  And I also, it branches out, right? Because if I were just thinking about, oh, this is about client acquisition workshops, know, like kind of a webinar sort of thing, that would be limiting.  But when you frame the question in this way, immediately it becomes clear that, yes, there are differences between the kinds of workshops, which is kind of a pattern of expertise, being able to spot, you know, these nuances.  And it positions me as someone that gets it and, you know, connects with a very practical, like, it is about running a business.  It's not just about having a workshop because it's a nice thing to... It serves a business purpose. So I think those two were the biggest in terms of like if I had to pick, but there were others for sure.

  And what are you going to do next and by when? This one.

40:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I have a few more interviews lined up, maybe six, I think. And I think based on that, I'll probably just make some sort of a sales page or something that is a bit more, you know, sticking a flag on the ground because I've been kind of dipping my feet.  And it was the flywheel was not like, oh, I create content, people don't react to it. Maybe I'm doing the wrong thing, but maybe people are not reacting for any of the reasons, like the quality, the structure, the timing of the content and so on.  This injection of confidence just says, you know what, do the thing, because the core idea is relevant, right? So I think that's the thing.  To answer your question, so I have six more interviews or so, and I think like in 10 days I'll have a sales page or something.  Awesome.

41:19 - JR Lay
  Once that's ready, I'm going to be in Italy, but just send me a message. I will not be checking anything.  I'm going to go offline with my family. Nice. But no, I would love to see the progress you're making.  Well, we'll do that.

41:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I appreciate that. You got to be.

41:37 - JR Lay
  All right.

41:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Joao. Joao. All right. Thank you, James. Have a nice one. Later. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.-bye. Bye
