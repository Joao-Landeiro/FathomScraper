0:00 - Martin Stellar
  Hello. This meeting is being recorded. Good afternoon.

0:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How are you? Good, good. Neo, can you see me?

0:08 - Martin Stellar
  Can you hear me? Everything fine?

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. I'm good, I'm good.

0:14 - Martin Stellar
  Very, very good indeed.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice.

0:18 - Martin Stellar
  Yes. I lost a $200 deal, $200,000 deal, so I'm happy.

0:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, that one. Is that the one? don't know. Maybe it was another one.

0:31 - Martin Stellar
  No, that's the one.

0:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You did mention that that could happen, and you didn't feel too stressed about it.

0:40 - Martin Stellar
  Nope. In fact, I'm happy about it.

0:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's an inspiring thing that I can aim towards.

0:47 - Martin Stellar
  Well, that's why I'm saving it, because there is a lesson in it.

0:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Just making notes. Sí. thank you for the... Thank Feedback on that, on those things. And about the lesson, tell me more about the lesson.

1:08 - Martin Stellar
  Well, I used to lose $5,000 deals and $20,000 deals. Now I'm losing a $200,000 deal. I'm moving up in the world.  So in terms of just the psychology of the kind of game that I'm trying to play, I talk to very different people these days than I used to, and I'm now playing a game where the numbers are higher, the stakes are higher.  And of course, I'm also going to continue losing opportunities and deals. But the fact that this is now a huge project means that in terms of positioning and being able to generate opportunities and having conversations, being introduced to a person like this, well, that means I've evolved quite a bit.  And on an operational level, like if I would have gotten this gig, I would have spent six months... Working all out, basically my only client, a training session here and a training session there, but I wouldn't be able to take on any projects because these people need a lot of things done and they need to get ready by September.  So it would mean that my entire summer is gone. Vacations, no weekends away with friends, it would mean eating up my summer.  And I'm not against that, I'm happy to do that. If I get paid enough, this would be enough. But with where I'm at now, my website is now ready, my SEO is beginning to work, I'm back into the content production mindset that I used to be in.

2:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Interesting word.

2:42 - Martin Stellar
  Why?

2:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because it sounds like you were riffling through a couple of words to say content production. And then it settled into mindset.

2:54 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah. Good catch. Normally, creating And for me, for many years, was absolutely effortless. I would just show up and I'd go to my list of topics and say, okay, that one.  And I'd write it and send it. And in the last two years, it's been up and down because of a number of circumstances, because partially because of a huge client project, which took me out of anything more than just my daily email.  So there's a mindset that I place myself in, if I go back to it over and over again, where there's always some cooking, like an infinity soup, what do you call it?

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  An everlasting soup? A perennial soup? I know what you mean.

3:41 - Martin Stellar
  Any day, you can just fish something out and it's ready and it's tasty. That's what my mind used to be like.  I still have phases like that, but I also have phases that I go, oh, how am I going to write about this one, that one, that one?  I don't Maybe try that. No, maybe try that one. Now, lately, I'm back in this hole. I just have to open that door to that mental space, and I'm in my content production space, mentally, mindset.  If I were to go and work on an intense project like this, that would be gone. So my SEO development, my content creating and series, I'm seeing sign-ups coming in that I never used to because my old website and positioning didn't generate sign-ups.  That's not happening, partially because of the content that I'm putting out. All of that would die. So the fact that I'm losing this deal, and I would have runway for years, well, that means that I get to continue building something that is going to compound more content, more SEO, more connections over time.  Working for six months with these people wouldn't compound anything. It would just give me budget. So the opportunity cost of that project is huge.  Would I have taken it? Yes. Am I happy that I didn't get it? Yeah.

4:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A good place to be to be happy. I've had a project recently that was a little bit like that, and like that in like the architecture of the project, like lots of need to spend a lot of energy on it.  And in my case, because you might have noticed that I'm poor at charging people at pricing, it wasn't even that worth it.  But it just took like a massive amount of my mind space after those meetings I was like spent. I think for a while that thing got me to smoke again, but on that level.  But anyway, then it went again, then it went away, and I was like, it was the only... Thank you.  Project I was working on, but it was good because I think a lot in terms of opportunity costs. In fact, like not to extend myself too much on that, but part of the reason why I quit my job and started and I went back to soloing was because of the opportunity costs.  I could see that I was working in tech and I had been laid off and I was 35, 36 when I was laid off and I was like, okay, these are cycles.  This will happen again in like seven years. I don't want to be laid off in seven years. So I said, I better start building this thing now.  So, yeah, the opportunity cost of things makes a lot of sense to me. Okay. So does this training have, I know it has a method, but does it have like an agenda or a curriculum?  the episode, okay.

6:53 - Martin Stellar
  So what's today's?

6:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's today's?

6:56 - Martin Stellar
  Today, we are going to... to... can do... We're going Thank The start of the talk, I'm going to start with listening.  So the way the system works, normally in the sales training, get a very actionable structure to do this and that thing, ask your people these seven questions, and then ask them seven confirmation questions, and then do the objection handling, and I don't have any of that.  The sales for nice people is, it is very structured, and it is very applicable, but it works by improving the way you relate to people, the way you communicate with people, the way you listen.  Each week, get another layer of depth and resolution in how communication works. And over time, that's going to stack up and transform the way you relate to people.  So it's not going to only work on your sales, you'll have better interactions with your children, or with your wife, or with a tax man, if you have to speak with a tax man.  Like in any situation, your communication works. And it's going to improve the functional way to make this happen is by taking the exercises seriously.  Each week comes with an exercise, which is not about setting specifically. It's about going out and doing things differently.  Just like if you have ever seen people in the dating game, you know, the pickup artist people, they will have to go all right this week, go and say hello to 10 strangers.  Why? I want to date a girl. Yes, but you're afraid to say hello to girls. So start by random people on the street.  An older person that feels safe. Somebody with a dog. Oh, how nice is your dog? Hello, how are you doing?  This person goes out, says hello to 10 people and goes, well, actually, that wasn't so bad. I can do that.  We use a similar type of exercise. We're not going to get you in the dating game, but we're going to make you practice different types of behavior.  in communication that you can practice with anyone really and that if you make them a habit in how you communicate with people will improve your communications with anyone ever in the rest of your life for instance verification instead of going oh they said yes that means no we always verify you saying yes do i mean do i understand that to mean that you want to move forward or is it it sounds good getting verification what you think you heard if you make that part of how you operate with people every interaction is always going to be better because you will never fall prey to operating under a mistaken assumption so that's how the system works that's how it gets implemented by running these exercises uh the system is composed of four pillars and each has three three types of conversation you
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Ng6JerqNBEaX_d5hpCgxdiqJKpssrx1L?timestamp=606.765698  We're going to start with Pillar 1, Listen. And we are going to start now. Right. So, we have Sales for Nice People.  Which is based on empathy, integrity, and ethics. Now, I built this because people tell me three things. I don't like selling.  Or they tell me I can't get paid when I'm worth. Or it's my conversion rate sucks. Too many people say no.  And it's designed to change that, to make your conversion rate go up. To make your earnings. Go up and to turn selling into something that actually is not so bad.  So four pillars, you've got listening, explain, ask, and profit. And if you're paying attention, you will see that this leads to the leap system.  You listen, you ask, you listen, you explain, you ask, so that you make a profit. Now, why is listening so important?  If you don't get your buyer, you're not going to get the deal. And where listening usually is done wrong is that people listen for the opening where they can now also say something.  They're listening for silence, they listen for, but you have two ears and one mouth, and you should use them in that proportion.  you. So Salespeople typically skip over the listening. They just dive straight into the pitch. Let me show you how our product works.  Let me show you what we got. And if you're really good at pitching, if you are a natural orator, then maybe you can get away with that.  Maybe you can make the deal happen. You also have to kind of push people into buying. It's not the way we do things.  We listen, and we very intentionally use the attitude of the explorer. So we bring, it's what I call leaning into an archetype.  So the archetype of the explorer, if you think about what an explorer is, it is somebody who's got some basic equipment, a compass, and some queening, and a map, and a machete.  And with that, we go into the jungle. We don't know what we're going to find, but we're going to discover.  That very basic equipment and the attitude of curiosity, we're going through the machete, right? I guess it a lot of sales.

13:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry.

13:16 - Martin Stellar
  It is the attitude of curiosity, where you make it your mission to truly understand someone, that enables you to get someone so well that they feel seen.  And that is a fundamental component of sales for nice people, is making people feel seen. Now, what happens when you listen and listen and listen, when you become the explorer?  You gain permission. Permission is required in order to explain, because if you don't have permission to talk about the offer, explain what's in the tin and how it works and what the price is and what the difference is,  Options are like your buyer saying, well, you have this problem. Can you help us? And you go, let me show you.  You don't have permission for that. You might actually cause them to lean out. But you want your leaner buyer to lean in and go, okay, tell me more.  Sounds interesting. I got a question. But when you operate without permission, you are forcing your buyer to lean out.  And you might be putting your finger on sore spots. Like who's the decision maker here? Okay. If you have no permission for that question, and you just launch into that question, and this person thinks they're the decision maker, but the CFO keeps overriding decisions.  And the person you're talking to is the decision maker, doesn't get the permission because of office politics. And you have now put your finger on something that is really painful and annoying.  They will not remember that well. Whereas if you go, hey, I've got a question. Do you mind if I ask about the way you guys make decisions?  Okay. Well, now your buyer is going to say, sure, ask away, and you will be able to tell from their reaction that it's a delicate subject, or they're going to be evasive and go, yeah, well, it's my decision.  You can tell there's something going on there. And that means you get intel. Because the entire process that you go through here is an exercise in gathering intel, in extracting information so that you can map out the world of your buyer.  Now, the first mode of conversation is the one where you ask questions. What is the problem that you're trying to solve?  What if you tried before? What would happen if you solve it? What would happen if you don't solve it?  What will happen if you don't solve it? What won't happen if you don't solve it? Why is it important to solve it?  Why? What is the cause of this problem? What are the ramifications? What's blocked or stuck because of this problem?  You have all kinds of questions to better understand what this buyer wants and why. Obviously, when you ask questions, you get answers.  Whoop-dee-doo. Now, here's where the problem starts with being human. We are pattern-seeking machines. We are meaning-making machines. And we operate with heuristics.  We exist to this day because if 100,000 years ago there would be something coming across the dunes in the setting sun, then you didn't know if that was just a camel or if that was, I don't know, a sheep or maybe a tribe of aggressive neighbors who want to kill you.  So the moment you see something on the hillside, you run. You duck because you assume you have the heuristic that...  Known is danger. Same thing with, and this is the subconsciousness at work. So your lizard brain has two jobs.  It's to keep you safe and move you towards well-being. That is the evolutionary imperative. Your subconscious has a control mandate.  The moment something is perceived as a threat, it overrules any decision and plan that you have, and it makes you do a thing.  I remember a couple months ago, I was walking early morning down by the river, and I had my earphones on, so I didn't hear anything behind me.  And suddenly there was this fairly large dog running up to me, barking. And it caught me by surprise. And the moment I noticed the dog, I turned around and I went, I  I growled so loud. It was just a panic reaction, right? It wasn't anything that I decided to do. I've never done it before.  I never barked at dogs. I barked at people. But in this case, my subconscious made me react in such an aggressive way that the dog backed off, right?  So this is one example of how the subconscious is always there. When you're in traffic and you find your foot on the brake, it's only afterwards that you realize, consciously, that somebody in front of you started slowing down.  So the subconscious is always assuming things to keep you safe. When you assume things about what people say, you're in trouble.  Because what somebody says is never the same as what they want to say. It is never the whole picture.  It is never complete. Sometimes it's not entirely true. Maybe people don't have enough confidence and trust to give you the whole story.  Very... There's all kinds of nuances and details that go into somebody's answer. And the worst thing that you can do is take an answer at face value.  Well, they said this, so that must mean that. No, you go back and you verify. Did you mean to say that?  Another question, which gets you a deepening of the answer. So what you're seeing is an ongoing relationship between the questions, the answers that you get, and what those answers actually mean.  So this is the model that goes with that. This is cyclical. This doesn't stop. This actually continues throughout the sales process.  Questions, answers, and what do those answers mean?

19:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Ng6JerqNBEaX_d5hpCgxdiqJKpssrx1L?timestamp=1198.079634

19:50 - Martin Stellar
  Makes sense. Okay. Let me see if I can get this. Right. see. So, your job when you're selling by this whole process of listening and questions and all the modules that we're going to get later, is to try and turn each conversation into a breakthrough conversation, as defined by being helpful, a conversation where a buyer goes, ah, this was useful, this was helpful, I feel seen, this person cares, takes an email.  All of that together gives the buyer the feeling that they were talking to someone who is to be trusted, who is there to advise them.  In sales, there's often this talk about becoming the trusted advisor, but nobody tells you how to do that. This is how you do that.  By listening, by deploying empathy, and to ask yourself continuously, what would it be like to be that person? What are they up against?  What are their fears? What concerns do they have? What reasons would they have to doubt that it would work, that it would help?  So empathy says putting yourself in somebody else's shoes. What would it be like to them? Now, for listening, there are five parameters.  We've talked about permission. We want to obtain permission. The archetype is the explorer and the driver. The modality, the energy that you bring is curiosity.  To be like a child, endlessly fascinated and curious about this other person, what it would be like. Do not fall for assumptions.  That is going kill your deals dead every time. So the action is to ask and verify that you got it right.  Makes sense so far?

21:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  far? Very much, yeah.

22:01 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. Now, we'll get to this in a minute. Let's see. Where's the rest? It's the wrong page, Martin. There we go.  Right. What have I missed? No. When you are talking to a buyer, when you are selling something, and it doesn't just apply to selling a product or a service, right?  Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Treasure Island, said that everybody everywhere is always selling something. I wish he was alive because I don't know if he was being cynical or a matter of fact, but I like to think that it's a matter of fact that he was just stating something obvious because we are always selling something.  Right now, I am... Because I want you to get this idea and this body of concepts into your system, and for you to buy that, I have to make sure that you keep paying attention.  This, too, is a sale. And if I sneeze in your face, or if I start yelling, or if I make no sense, you stop paying attention, there's no sale.  And any time that you try to get something done with someone else, you are effectively selling. If your wife wants to go to the park, but you want to go to the golf course, well, then you both have a sale to make, and who's going to buy what?  You having the conversation with your wife about what's going to be the most fun way to spend our Sunday, well, that is exploring what she thinks things are like, sharing what you think things are like, and then finding a middle ground so that you're both happy to move forward.  That is selling. Thank Selling happens in the context of a conversation. So the trick to making sales for nice people work is to always be looking for ways to further and improve the conversation.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Ng6JerqNBEaX_d5hpCgxdiqJKpssrx1L?timestamp=1464.375423  Show you, in fact. Yes. Right. Because you have the sale, which happens in the context of a conversation. That happens in the context of a relationship.  So there's a very interesting dynamic going on when you focus on quality conversation. in interview. you. So by working very specifically and directly on having the best quality conversation possible, you achieve a number of things.  You make it useful for that person to deal with you, which is great, because that's how you stop getting gasted.  Because if every sales interaction is useful and helpful, well, then of course the person is going to want to talk to you again.  Whereas if every sales conversation is you trying to get a yes out of them, your conversation is going to crash pretty quickly.  So instead, you want to try and develop conversations and keep them going because no sale is over. No conversation ever has to stop until somebody says it's enough, leave me alone.  So by having these conversations, by trying to ask better questions that make it more... Helpful, you improve the conversation, which strengthens the relationship, which makes it more likely that you're going to be in touch until there's a step.  And in that conversation, there are two types of conversation. There's the conversation between you and the other person, but there's also the conversation that's going on in somebody's head.  This is a famous marketing victim that you have to join the conversation going on in the buyer's mind. This person has had this problem for a month, a year, 10 years, who knows?  It may be a problem that went away and came back. And they have a story, they tell themselves about it.  I'm such a fool for not having solved this sooner. I wish I were able to hire the right people.  I have tried so many things, but it just never worked. I don't know if I should make this. These people lay in bed at night and think about this.  These people complain about it over a drink at the bar with their friend. This is the conversation that's going on.  The buyer's mind. And when you have a conversation and ask the right questions, you become part of that conversation.  Mentally, you become a tenant in their mental real estate. And they start having a dialogue with you when you're not in the room.  But you can only get that done if you ask the right conversations. So if you show up and you pitch, you give people reasons to buy.  Well, then the only conversation they're going to have with you in their head is, I don't want to talk to him again because he's trying to get me to buy something.  Whereas if you go, how long has it been since you've been frustrated that your IP doesn't bring you more leads and revenue?  Oh, you fucker. That's been a problem for five years and it's painful. Now they hang up and they go away and they start thinking about the conversation that you have.  You go, that son of a . He's really right. This has been an old and painful problem and the cost of it over the last five years has been staggeringly high.  If only I'd have done this sooner. Conversation with you when you're not in the room, because you put the right, painful, pointy question in front of them.

28:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, in that example. So the logic of questions, you know, sincere curiosity, proving the quality of the conversation, makes a lot of sense to me.  And I think there's probably something I might find easier than other parts. But I don't know, let's go through this.  Thank Now, this question you've, this example you gave, how long has it been since?

29:06 - Martin Stellar
  Should you be frustrated that your IP doesn't generate leads?

29:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay. That question is based on them saying that they're frustrated about this? Because before that I asked, is this a problem?  Do you want to solve this?

29:23 - Martin Stellar
  Something like that?

29:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

29:27 - Martin Stellar
  Well, for instance, one of the questions that you could ask is, what is your biggest frustration at the moment in the context of your IP and the training?  You wanted to talk to me about a training. Okay. Interesting. I have a lot of questions. So you don't have a training at the moment?  No, not really. What is most frustrating about not having a training? Well, just, you know, I know it's good stuff and I know it could generate more opportunities for actual consulting work.  Oh, I see. How long has that been frustrating for you? So you're using a question to trigger an answer, which then enables you to ask another question.  In this case, not necessarily verifying the meaning, but you are trying to add to the meaning. they say it's frustrating that it doesn't generate more opportunities.  Okay, what does that mean? Does that mean it's been running for five years, this frustration? No. Yes. Okay, so now you have more internet, though.  You have now more data.

30:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

30:44 - Martin Stellar
  See, you need to try and... Do you know the word Sonder? S-O-N-D-E-R? Sonder? Sonder is the... the... Realization that that other person is an entire world, just like you.  It's a made-up word, but it means the insight and the realization that everybody is a whole world unto themselves.  So a buyer shows up, and they have a company this big, and they have a revenue challenge that size, and they have a bookshelf full of books in the back, and you go, okay, so that's my buyer.  No, no, no, no, no. That is set of heuristics. That is your mental map, your representation of that person.  It is a very low-resolution map, because you just don't have any more data points. So you create your representation, Johnny Byer, but you know nothing about Johnny Byer.  You don't even know where he went to school, whether he has siblings or not. So we know nothing about other people, but we behave as if we understand them and we get them.  And we're going to tell them what life should be like and what they should choose and what they should do.  Because going But you're talking to a map that you made. You're not talking to the whole person. That's how you miss connections with people because they might have an unresolved PTSD from being lifted by their former co-founder.  Okay, well, if that's in the way and you're not aware of it, then you're saying these things might be exactly what triggers them.  So your job when you deploy empathy is you need to learn your people. And the goal of the whole process is to continuously improve the resolution of your map, of your understanding, to constantly learn more about what that person's world is like.  Learn your people. That is how you deploy strategic empathy. By asking questions, all the way to the point that they say, how does it work?  So we don't try to talk our way to the sale, we ask our way to the sale. Because if you ask questions long enough, inevitably, ultimately, your buyer is going to go, can you help us?  How does that work? They volunteer the sale.

33:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. I have some questions, but mostly this makes, yeah, this makes sense. Let me run through the remainder, and then there's time for questions.  Perfect, perfect.

33:53 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, so you wanted to figure out why they want to solve a problem. And the why behind the why.  Bye. So this is the Toyota 5y exercise. What is the cause of this? What is important about that? What is important about that?  What is important about that? Because if they say, oh, we want the training to generate more leads. Well, why do you want that?  Well, because we have all this IP, and it's not really doing any job. So what's important about making that IP do a job?  Well, I've been building this stuff for 20 years. And what's important about making that leveraged now? Oh, I'm getting older, and I want to have more time to travel with my spouse, because I've worked hard for many years.  Why is it important to travel with your spouse? Well, it's important because I have achieved a lot. But the one thing missing is freedom to spend time away from my desk.  So the final ultimate why is not to generate more. Opportunities, it is to have the satisfaction and the reward of an accomplished life.  That is why they buy, not so that they generate more opportunities. So you need to find out what is the why behind the why, because that's the motivator.  Alongside that motivator, the purchase motivator, you also have the buy blockers, which is the reasons that people aren't going to buy.  As you will see in today's article, buy blockers are what other people call objections. And objections in sales are typically the thing that happens when you've sent your proposal and the buyer says, oh, yeah, but the wrong time, we can't get buy-in, we don't have the budget, can we change the scope?  Okay, so you've been through your three, four, seven conversations. You've finally got a 50,000 deal on the table. You've sent your proposal, they said they want it, they said they're going to do Do it, and now you have to figure out how to get over this obstacle.  For nice people, you look for the obstacles, the buy blockers, the objections, as early as you can. So in my first conversation, I will go, well, I think we're looking at a 20,000 30,000 pound project here.  Is that going to be a problem? Because now I know in my first 20 minutes that they don't have the budget for solving this problem.  Now I can save myself time. Or I might want to ask a question about implementation. Hey, so if I create this training for you and we run through this together and you get the four weeks and you have the whole training.  You told me that you have a really busy business and that it's usually quite chaotic because of the nature of the industry.  If you buy this from me, are you actually going to be able to use that training? Will you have the space to create the website for it and run the ad campaign and sell the training?  Do you have staff to deliver the training? And your buyer goes, well, we'll figure that out. At some point, there's no sale.  Because if that is your buyer's idea of dealing with the problem, it means they haven't answered the fundamental question.  How am I going to make my investment with João bring a return? Well, I have no solution for that.  I don't have the space for it. I don't have the resources. I don't have the tranquility. So I spend money with João, 1,000, 2,000, 10,000, and it's not going to return anything yet because I have not figured out how to make it return.  And that is going to be the buy blocker. But if in that first or second conversation you figure out that that is the buy blocker, well, you can have a conversation about it.  Oh, yeah, that's not the first time I see that. To make a training properly yield results means I have a template for that.  And I can include in the program some specific questions and guidance on how to prepare for deploying the training.  Should we have a conversation about that? So now you are... ... ... Surfacing a buy blocker early on and proposing a conversation about how to solve that buy blocker.  Now you're also being helpful and you're giving people a different way to look at their situation, different way to look at you.  Because you're not just trying to get them to buy something, you're trying to make sure that they get a return from it.

38:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

38:28 - Martin Stellar
  As you do this, you go through these questions, you gain their buy-in. Your buyer, with every minute they spend talking to you, increases their budget and invested time and energy in the relationship.  And as you go through this process, you will start to find common ground. Which means you'll be developing vision.  We'll be going into that in a lot more detail. Thank you. But the foundation is that you work on permission and you always ask for permission.  Do you mind if ask you about this? You said something interesting there, can I double click on it? This might be a left field question, I hope you don't mind.  So that your buyer gives you permission, so that you get to ask more and more probing questions, so that you end up doing a diagnosis.  Because the worst thing that you can do is prescribe a remedy before you do a diagnosis. If you do that as a doctor, it's malpractice.  But it is exactly what most salespeople do. Hey, our SEO is sick. Well, then you need to buy my SEO program because that's going to fix it for you.  Okay, but why is their SEO sick? How sick is their SEO? Do they have the resources to improve the content?  Or do they think that they're going to just fix it with AI slop once they have your SEO analysis and report?  What to say? Am I going to say this thing? Am I going to talk about the price? What should I say?  Well, let me just blurt words at you and try to convince you that it's all such a great idea.  No, no, no, no, no. You say as little as you can, you ask as much as you can, and then your buyer is going to tell you exactly what you need to say to them.  And that is chapter one. That's how to listen.

41:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Okay, so this makes sense to me.

41:39 - Martin Stellar
  Okay.

41:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I was thinking about, this makes sense to me, and it started to make sense. So this kind of perspective, this view on sales, especially for these kind of services, to be more of a conversation.  It's kind of a more recent, I think. I I had the stereotypical misconception around , right? And so I'm changing that mental model, and I'm seeing like, oh, actually, there's a way of doing this that relates to what seems to work for me.  So I'm really sold on this approach. And it's a recent approach for me. So, I mean, there's a lot of the, there's still a lot of ROI in that curve.  It's far away from plateauing. So there's a lot of things I can do that will make me much better than I am now.  And the questions that I find myself still dealing with right now are, for instance, So, you. I noticed that I don't want to...  And when I was younger, I felt the same thing around dating. I didn't want people to understand what I was doing.  And that made me try to get like really convoluted and plausible deniability because it felt like, oh, people cannot tell.  They should not be able to tell that I'm trying to do this, right? And if you have tips on that...  Because I've heard a friend, and I thought this was really interesting. It was like, oh, when I see someone applying the sales techniques to me, and I'm quoting my friend, in my mind, I know that they know what they're doing.  And actually, this makes me more confident. But to me, I was like, I get it, but I'm not sure if that's how I feel.  For me, it feels like barriers up. Like, I know what you're doing, you know? So, I don't know exactly what have to do with this resistance.

43:55 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, well, that example, you're talking about... Your friend who sounds washed in the wool, sounds like somebody with experience.  Your friend sounds salty. And it sounds like your friend was talking to a quality professional. Now, a salty, experienced person who meets a salesperson who knows what they're doing, yeah, of course, you're going to respect that.  Because that salesperson is the game. And if it's also a person with integrity, yeah, then I would respect that as well.  When I see someone selling at me and they both treat me and they well and they listen to me and they know their game, then I'm going to respect that.  It does not apply to you. You are a different individual. You have a different experience. You have different obstacles to overcome.  And in your situation. See, you go like, I don't want people. watch. Thank Catch on that I'm trying to do something so I'm going to be very convoluted and try to obfuscate my game so that's one direction you can also go the other direction you just put your cards on the table it's funny I'm thinking about a girl I met in Costa de Caparica she was a waitress and she kept stopping by my table and talking to me and she was just nice and friendly and open and on the third night I'm like hey um would it be out of order if I ask you to go out for dinner with me and she goes no that wouldn't be out of order and yeah let's do that so instead of trying to hide anything I was just being straightforward like hey I appreciate the way you treat me would like to have dinner with me notice that I used a permission question permission created question would it be out of order would it be inappropriate if I ask you to go out for dinner with me thank  So, and you will see this come back, cards on the table is one of the most important things that you can do.  And I will tell that to people, look, I think this is a great company. This problem is eminently solvable.  Obviously, I would love to start on this project, and if we can, next week. Sure. But there are some things we need to talk about, because it's very costly, and it's going to be very demanding, and you as the CEO are the first on the chopping block, because a sales problem is a leadership problem.  Is that going to be okay? So, in three sentences, I give them an entire, first I put my cards on the table, say, look, obviously I want this deal, I like money, I think you do too.  But we have to talk about a couple of things. So, putting my cards on the table, then giving the explanation of what the deal is.  Like, and work to be done, and then pointing the gun at my CEO buyer. You're ready to take this on, buddy, because it's you who's going to solve the thing.  If you start by putting your card to the table, you disarm people. Because most of the time, people try to hide things.  People try to obfuscate, try to... I hope they're not... Like, a while ago, I had this lead, and it was a sporting equipment.  They equip gyms. And I had a great conversation, and they had kind of help. They had a kind of problem that I can solve.  And then I said, yeah, listen, but I have a skeleton in the closet. I am not a sports guy.  I mean, I like exercise and fitness, but I'm more of a yoga guy than a kettlebell kind of guy.  Is that going to be a problem? It's like, no, no, no, no, actually, I'm glad that you're saying it, because that means you bring a fresh perspective that would be really good.  So I put my cards on the table and said, I know nothing of your world. I see People in the park with Lycra, pulling themselves up from bars, and I have never been with one of those people, or even been with one of those people, so I don't know you guys.  So I put my cards on the table, I pulled the skeleton out of the closet, and he felt safe because I was, instead of trying to hide something, I was making a damaging admission.  Which, ultimately, is not damaging at all.

48:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, got it. No, there's a thing that I sometimes do. Maybe I'll get, like, a short clip of it as an example, because I'm not going to send, like, record.

49:01 - Martin Stellar
  Oh, yeah, by the way, that's one thing on the rules of engagement. I don't listen to voicemails.

49:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, perfect.

49:08 - Martin Stellar
  Sometimes people want to send me a voicemail.

49:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's very asymmetric.

49:13 - Martin Stellar
  I hate them.

49:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Here in Brazil, people use them a lot. Yes. Okay, but just to illustrate, I might send you like a video clip, but I understand that...

49:30 - Martin Stellar
  Maybe you watch it, maybe you That's fine.

49:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's different, yes. Yeah. But here's the thing. There's a thing I sometimes do, and maybe I'm sure I can better calibrate it, which is something along the lines of making grounded assumptions, but they're kind of lips of faith.  So this email that I sent, I sent you the email, the conversation with that person. So this was a person, she does like branding stuff.  Maybe you know the profile. and I was like, oh, this is happening. I some of your clients, they have their own visual references, and they come to you and they know what they want.  And I'll guess that some of them don't have any visual references, and you need to do that work with them.  Is this roughly true? So I said something like this. Is this too much assumption? She didn't seem to react poorly to it.  I've been working on calibrating these assumptions. It's like little leaps. So my question is, what do you think about this?

50:37 - Martin Stellar
  Don't do it in an email, typically, because when you send emails, your email has one job, and that is to get a reply.  People often make their emails too complete. Too much information in there. Too many questions in there. Too many different topics to think about.  And then your buyer has to figure out what matters. Most what they should reply to and they have to find time for it and oh somebody's calling me I'll get to it later later becomes never so that's why you keep your emails as short as possible one topic one question thank you hit send in conversation it is a very good question to to ask what you just said you can do it in different ways um so one way is to make a bid on a hypothesis yeah what you're telling me is interesting I see that I don't know if this is the same thing for you if you correct me if I'm wrong but I very often see that branding clients already have some of their assets their visual assets but in other cases they don't which makes for a completely different situation so  Is that something that applies to you? Do you have the distinction as well? So you are stating hypothesis that I think this might be true for you based on my experience.  Did I get it right? Is that right for you? Is that true for you?

52:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's three elements to this. based on the experience, which is context, then you have the observation, then you have the verification.

52:26 - Martin Stellar
  Is that it? Yes. So the second format you could use it is... Do you mind if ask you a question?  Sure. Well, I'm wondering what your situation is like, because some people bring their visual assets and others need help with that.  What is most common in your situation? So now you're asking for a straight question simply to tell you whether you should think left or should think...  Left Right.

53:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, the first one. The third one.

53:19 - Martin Stellar
  Okay. The third one is when they say something and your reaction is, right, like I've seen before, people bring their own assets.  Now, this is the heuristics trap. This is if you believe what you think, you might actually lose the conversation.  So, the moment you go, oh, yeah, I know that I recognize that. That's when you verify. That's when you go, just so that I understand correctly, when you said that thing, does that mean that people usually bring their assets?  So, there you state, I have this improvement. Impression, did I get that right? Would you like to correct me?

54:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Perfect. Final question. we have time for the final question?

54:16 - Martin Stellar
  Yes, sir.

54:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you recommend for me to deal with not wanting to be a never-ending... Okay, I'll describe my feeling.  My feeling is I understand the logic of ask the way into a sale. I usually do have questions to ask.  That's not the trouble. But I start thinking, like, I don't want to be annoying, and I don't to turn this into, like, you know, tending to a three-year-old asking why, why, why, why, why, why, why.  And then because of that, I hold myself back at some point. But I'm sure that there's ways to not...  Hold myself back, and that's my question.

55:06 - Martin Stellar
  Well, this sounds like you might be overthinking it a bit.

55:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's what I do.

55:17 - Martin Stellar
  Yeah, so long. So if you would have a... It's a two-column table with, in column A, reasons why people should buy from you, and in column B, reasons why they shouldn't.  Then in column B, well, the reasons they shouldn't buy from you is this buyer thinks the training will sell itself.  Bad buyer. This buyer expects their team to pick up the training happening? Yeah. Yeah. happens. Instantly start delivering the same quality education that my buyer has been doing manually for the last 20 years.  That's not how things work, buddy. Don't buy my stuff because you're not going to get what you want. This buyer is making a last-ditch effort with their last runway to try and rescue a sinking ship.  Sorry, the training is going to come with a marketing process, and you have to verify that you have the right avatar.  Your runway is going to last. Don't buy this thing. So there's all kinds of reasons why somebody shouldn't buy from you.  There's also all kinds of reasons why somebody should buy from you. So these are the qualifiers and the disqualifiers.  You don't need to be a child going why, why, why, but you do need to understand, why actually do they want to make this purchase?  What do they expect that... So let me ask you a couple of questions about what is actually important about having a training of your So by setting the context, by setting the stage, you make it very acceptable to be a little bit diagnostic and to be a little bit why, why, why about it.  And Bayer's response typically remarkably well to it.

57:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

57:57 - Martin Stellar
  it. Thank you.

58:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

58:06 - Martin Stellar
  My pleasure. Thank you. I have a question as well, if you have a moment.

58:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do.

58:14 - Martin Stellar
  Very brief. With what you've seen so far, who do you know that you think might want to have a conversation about this same program that you think maybe I should speak about?

58:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe Peter. I thought about this before.

58:34 - Martin Stellar
  Peter.

58:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Peter Giordano.

58:38 - Martin Stellar
  Peter Giordano.

58:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The third fan's name. So Peter never expressed anything, any specific concrete need for this. But... But... Peter. Peter. Peter.  Peter. Thank I think we probably think about things in a similar fashion, and specifically, we make things harder for us because we try to think about stuff from first principles, and we've joked amongst ourselves, like, we're doing that thing, right?  Yeah, yeah, we're doing that thing. So, and, but Peter works with pricing, which I would assume that for him, it's a bit of a tricky situation.  never told me anything in this regard, I'm just assuming, but I would assume this could be, like, an emotional tricky situation to get the outside help around that because he works with pricing.  But I see, I think it very much fits with the whole, you know, experts. This person, overthinker, avatar. Is there someone else?  I don't know. Maybe, yes, because I talk to a lot of people like this, like me. Peter is just more recent.

1:00:35 - Martin Stellar
  This is jordanos.com?

1:00:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe.

1:00:39 - Martin Stellar
  Let me see. Pete Giordano.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Ng6JerqNBEaX_d5hpCgxdiqJKpssrx1L?timestamp=3641.346871

1:00:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, probably. Peter.

1:00:46 - Martin Stellar
  Where did he go?

1:00:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't think this is the guy.

1:00:56 - Martin Stellar
  No, it's a different guy. Let's see.

1:01:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you. Peter Jordan III. Yeah, I found it. It's here. I'll put it on the chat. It's Peter.

1:01:14 - Martin Stellar
  Oh, Jordan III with an Italian spelling.

1:01:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, yeah.

1:01:21 - Martin Stellar
  Right. He's in strategy. Okay. Let me have a look. Because strategy people tend to really get what I'm about.  So why don't I go and have a look at his stuff and see if I get what he is about.

1:01:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Do you have another minute? Yes. It's not a question, just an observation. So look at this. I'm just paying attention.  We've spoken a few times already. This is our second session. You asked me for a referral. I told you I feel very seen.  This makes sense to me. trust you. You asked me for the referral, and I was like, okay, there's Peter.  And then I gave you some context around Peter. There was a side of me that was like, am I being fair to Peter?  Because am I exposing him? Or like, you know, there was a side of me thinking about that. Like, if we didn't have built this relationship so far, it wouldn't work for sure.  And then, like, when I put in the website, what I felt was like, okay, I trust that Martin will not be clueless about this, of course.  But it's like, there was a side of me like, am I putting Peter in a difficult position later on?  You know? So just expressing my... And I keep getting back to my attitudes towards sales that I think is still very naive, I suppose.

1:03:01 - Martin Stellar
  I would attenuate that. I don't think it's fair to say naive. Your attitude towards sales is still under the influence of a lot of really bad examples.  What we typically see from salespeople in industry, in films, books, it's all... The sales guy is always the  who tries to make people do things they don't want to do.  And either they are being ridiculed for it or they're being made the hero for it because they get away with it and they put it off.  So we're seeing all kinds of examples about sales that really aren't about sales. It is about people who... Are acting like a dick or who are trying to bully people into doing something or who try to manipulate and weasel their way into getting compliance.  That is called sales, but that is not what sales is about. That's just being a bully or a dick.  Or both. So you've just seen far too many bad examples. not that you're naive about it. Now, where it comes to Peter Giordano, I like that your integrity radar flashed because you don't want to do things that are out of integrity and you don't want to.  The way I see things like this, asking for introductions, goes back to the first principle of Sales for Nice People that everything you do, whether it's in marketing or in sales, has to be inherently fundamentally helpful.  So that if you would put money on it, the price tag, then that would be worth it. I could put a dollar on each of my articles every day, and it's good enough to be worth a dollar, or even nine dollars if I would want to, because my mission is to make everything I do valuable in and of itself.  When I ask for introductions, well, I plan to bring Peter, or anybody that you would mention, a quality conversation, which may lead to a sale.  Maybe, maybe not, it doesn't really matter. I want to connect with people where I didn't feel I wasted my time.  So if I'm introduced to someone who is open, and who is responsive, and who is keen to see things differently, well, then I might, at the end of an hour, not have sold anything.  I might not get an introduction, but at least it won't have been a waste of time, because this person took away something from it, and I get to feel good about myself.  So I ask for an introduction without any expectations. I have no attachments to any sort of... Outcome? I'm looking to connect with valuable people.  You are valuable people. Therefore, people in your world probably are also valuable people. So anybody that you think would benefit from a meeting with me, good, I'll give them my time.  I trust you enough in terms of making the assessment and to be discerning enough to not waste my time or your friend's time to make only connections and introductions that are relevant.  And I think that is something now I'm guessing. But I suppose that on intuitive subconscious level, you sensed this and was comfortable enough to mention his name and give me the link.

1:06:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Also knowing that I'm not going to call him up and say, João said you should totally buy my thing.

1:06:48 - Martin Stellar
  Obviously, I'd never do that.

1:06:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay, cool.

1:06:55 - Martin Stellar
  Thank you.

1:06:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So is there a homework for the week?

1:06:59 - Martin Stellar
  Like specific homework? Sorry, yes, that is the homework, is going forward this week, but also in the future, throughout your life.
  SCREEN SHARING: Martin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Ng6JerqNBEaX_d5hpCgxdiqJKpssrx1L?timestamp=4027.968568  When you have spoken to someone, you can only give people a breakthrough conversation if they feel seen. And you can only do that when you really listen.  So make it a habit when you've interacted with someone, and it can be after speaking to the baker for five minutes about the weather.  It doesn't matter. Review your conversation and ask yourself how much did I actually really listen here? Yesterday, I had a salsa lesson and this girl came to my house and I said, hey, you didn't reply to me three times in a row about whether I'm going to get a salsa lesson.  Can you please, you know, reply? And she goes, yeah, but it was because of this and it was because of that.  And I didn't want to listen because it was excuses. I'm paying for classes. And if you don't tell me that you're not going to be there tomorrow, then I need to make different plans.  So please communicate with me. I don't want to even listen. In other situations, I realized that I've been speaking with someone.  And actually, I was impatient and I was frustrated and annoyed because of my own stuff. And I just wanted to have them stop talking so that I could say something.  And I didn't listen at all. And in that situation, it might have been right. But normally, this happens automatically.  We don't pay attention. We are not aware of whether we are actually listening or not. So by making it a habit to go, how did I show up for this conversation?  Did I actually listen here? You train yourself to have a post-mortem or post-hoc review of how you show up to an interaction with people.  Make sense?

1:08:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Make sense.

1:08:58 - Martin Stellar
  All right. Thank you. Good. Then that's it for today. And I'll see you on Slack. Sure. Thank you. Have a nice one.  See you next week. You too. Take care.
