0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. What are you doing?

0:09 - A L
  Okay, here it is.

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, decent, weakened. How about Yeah, it's getting really cold and dark here, so.

0:24 - A L
  How is over there now, how is it in Brazil?

0:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's so weird because it's the Christmas is on the beach, right? Yeah. I'll be in Portugal, but the first few years was very strange, but people still do like Christmas decorations the same style as you do over there.  So it's just like in shopping malls and all of that. So it's a bit weird, but right now it's really blue.  There's no clouds.

0:58 - A L
  It's a little bit wispy.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  not too hot but it's interesting.

1:04 - A L
  Oh it's nice I was I was talking with a cousin who lives in Thailand I was like how do I get a developer based in like you know in Thailand like is it like so nice like that I could like we have an excuse to go visit you know never been there yeah I was like yeah I was like how is it Thailand I would love to know I'm not the most known for tech uh he was like India's probably more well known I'm like yeah I know I'm like India but I want to be at the beat of Thailand you know so maybe you can find a developer team and go ahead and yeah I know hello hello how are you guys doing good all right it's been all right yes already moved to there so I think so was it snowing a couple days ago yeah it was snowing uh yesterday  this morning my husband was sliding around bringing the kids to school and uh it's uh yeah I'm just saying that uh yeah it's starting to get bad I guess until December like 24th you know 22nd it'll get really dark and yeah even when my kids went to school this morning it was like pitch black at like 745 it was really weird that they have like the reef on and stuff it just I still can't get used to it you know after so many years.  How long have you been living there? About 15 on and off for 15 years yeah so I just try not to leave the house during the winter.

2:35 - Mau Medeiros
  Many people do. I've never been there during the winter so yeah. Oh really? I've been to Stockholm five times but it was during the summer and I've been to Oslo three times I think yeah but it was like September maximums October okay yeah it was cold but

3:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  not that bad yeah no like november is the worst november and december like december closer to christmas so people are okay with it so it's like november and february people are usually the most angry yeah seasonal effective disorder right exactly so let's try to get in great spirits right now with our workshop but i'll share the screen but i'll also send you a link here there's no password for this session and you'll recognize some of the some of the stuff but you also see that some of the things are a little bit different okay so basically uh so today's about today's about the integrity hub right and you'll see that some aspects are a little bit like what we did for the employee and portal but some others are different because on this on this aspect for the integrity hub there's two  main parameters that are quite different. One is like there's less things about it, that it's less developed, and the other one is that it's very outwards-facing and very related to growth goals, so the structure of the workshop will reflect that.  So we've made some changes here, but this is basically the same context map. Now we have these two roles, the approval role and the basic role, but they're basically the same, they're a kind of internal employee, right?  An internal employee might have more responsibilities or privileges in terms of the platform, but it is still kind of the same thing.  And for today, we'll focus on the integrity hub, which is like outwards-facing, right? Just so we have the same sort of structure for everything in terms of definitions, I've cleared some of them and others that I get.

5:00 - A L
  they were more obvious to me others were not so much so let's try to figure this out so the integrity hub is something that does something how would you we fill up this integrity hub is a summary of all the activities that a company is doing around esg and and then is it so that that then so that external or so that stakeholders stay on top of what they're doing okay and and

6:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right? Compliance officers are doing. Cool. Or the company is doing, not compliance officers are doing.

6:08 - A L
  Oh, okay, okay, The whole company, right? Yeah, the company is doing. And then I would say it's also a repository, like it's a place where external stakeholders can ask for information, a place that external stakeholders can ask for information and communicate with the company, yes.  And then I would say it's a, and then I would say another point is it's also a tool, a tool that employees can use for sales, or like investing, bragging or something like that, so they can link to the portal and then like share it and say like this is everything that we're doing, yeah.

6:54 - Mau Medeiros
  Okay, so in that sense, that should be a little bit more  and different. It's something to brag about, it could be very, very nice.

7:03 - A L
  Say you're still like, yeah, interesting. It's like, cool. I think you could have like, depending on the company, some companies are boring, so then they don't meet like that.  But I think one of the feedback from one of Mars is like, yeah, please make it cool, because you want to be able to show this off.  I think the cooler they get, the cooler other companies will want it. And then that becomes a selling process, too.  They're willing to send it out to a lot of people, and then they're like, oh, this is cool.

7:30 - Mau Medeiros
  And what type of information that, you know, several companies get my request for this? Yeah, something to brag about, is there any?

7:45 - A L
  Like, I think it's usually, usually questions, I'm trying to put something in the chat. I can't know, maybe it's not going be.  Usually companies, like, so usually what I see, like investors or larger companies. companies of the supply chain, they have like a questionnaire that they send to the question.  It will be like, Mao, can you answer all of these questions about environmental policy, and a lot of companies spend a lot of time individually.  I got like 30, 40 questionnaires from different companies, and it was so much work, you know, for individual questions.  So you can actually go and say like, hey, I'm not going to answer your questionnaire. Here's my integrity portal that lists everything that we do.  know, you can download the information that you need, you can look at it and you just, you know, that should be enough for you to leave us alone kind of thing.  A self-serve sort of thing. Okay, I'm trying to phrase that.

8:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll just, I'll, I'll remember this self-serve data for designers. Okay, so in terms of, this is, I'm very glad we've asked this because I think we were leaning on this side, we're leaning stronger on the more bragging or the  aspect of it.  And like in the feedback in the mirror that you did before with or some of the interviews, this was a question that that popped up because some of the other compliance officers and other people that you guys interviewed, they were using language that gave me think that was the pain that they were feeling or the thing they were trying to solve was more related to just make it easy for people to see what's happening and less so about make it really exciting, right?  And now that you've stated this for us, I think it's a little bit more of this.

9:59 - A L
  I think it's like It depends and this is kind of the challenge like if you are a compliance officer versus your company that doesn't have a compliance officer.  So if you're a compliance officer, you're kind of like serious and you want to be able to show more statistics and everything that you're doing to kind of justify your role, you know, and so that's why they have it.  And then you have the ones that don't have sustainability compliance office. They just want to brag that they're getting it done and all these cool things that they're doing.  So that's kind of the difference between them, but I think it can be very similar. A lot of this like, yeah, like kind of be very similar.  I think it depends because like, like I just threw in a in the chat, I just threw in this ISO for the environmental, right?  And these are all things that you need to do for like to be able to show that you're doing it, right?  Like if you want to go for the ISO. So this would be like, like you could see this on like other Vamptar or some other ones.  It's like, look at all of these things, you know, I'm doing that I have control on like, you know, versus like if you are doing nothing on environment, is like, look at I do all of these different things, even though there could be like not that much behind it, but at least it shows that they've gone through a method  And we've tried and done a lot right for a compliance officer sustainability officer that might not want to go for that So they might just want to look at like you know, what are the controls that they're doing?  How does it work like that? So they might not want it as much, but I think these are like and I have like some documents I can send you around that but these are the controls that you want to be like I think the impression that you want to leave them is like I have this under control leave me alone You know like I have this under control.  I have an ISO certification I'm doing all of these different things bothering me. Look at how great I am compared to the person who doesn't have it Right, so I think like you know that we have 12 controls around these things, you know, we have 15 documents, you know like something like that To be able to show like we have everything under control Because it's like a lot of people you go to their website It's like we care about environmental management and we have a policy, you know, and that's what they have And it's really hard to compare what they're actually doing how they're doing it But on the integrity hub if you're going to be like I'm externally out of  it. I have a certification from an extra audit. I'm covering 15 controls. Here's the documentation you want access to.  It's more of a yes, you have it under control and you're not picking it kind of thing.

12:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, cool. Thank you. So just organizing my methods here. Yeah. So the integrity hub is outward facing. People on the inside can obviously also look at it.  And by being both clear and also digestible, interesting, engaging, we can just get people to see what we're doing without us needing to tell them all the time, right?  Can we talk, because in terms of the purpose, based on previous conversations and the workshop and the materials, these are like the two main purposes that we were considering before.  And I think based on what you brought here, there's something else.

13:21 - A L
  Yeah, there's something, service that's like, I think an entry point or it's like, it's a common place, like there's a stake holders that you need to interact with, suppliers or investors or whatever.  So it's like a place to send external stakeholders who want to find out more information about what you're doing in ESG.  So it's like a common eating point or a common central repository or something.

14:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, is this, did I capture the way you, you want it?

14:11 - A L
  Yeah, I think one of the things I really like the idea that you had of like, you know, Spotify raps, you know, like, so they have a way for that employees can share it very easily, you know, like, not just copy a link, but like even the thing like share this or like, you get into this cool thing that you could share and brag about your company and like, okay, look at what we're doing, you know, I think that's kind of cool, too.  Mm-hmm.

14:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, it's great that you said that because there's a chunk of today's exercise that's taking inspiration and breaking apart Spotify Raps and see what we can bring into our sites.  Okay, so in terms of more assumptions of things that we assume to be true, so a cooling in Integrated Hub will lead to our sales, showing them what we do will lead to less interruptions and out of the blue request.  Evidence-based will lead to more trust. There's some aspect of outcome, the cool thing also already, say something about it.  It seems to me that because it is a hub, and just because of the last thing you just said, it serves multiple audiences.  So there's an aspect of it that's related to how different people with different objectives don't get lost in it.  How do we manage, how do we balance comprehensive information for a certain profile, but also interesting information for a different kind of profile.  Do you agree with this? this make sense?

15:55 - A L
  Yeah, I think there could be like one is like you just give them the information and they could either  Update and if we don't have it and they can request for more information, you know somewhere else, you know But we kind of almost like throw the information at them like I think that's the same with like Vanta has Like a trust center.  I don't know if you guys can see it That one is like they just throw a shitload of information You don't go through like all the list of what they've actually done and all the controls And they have like 46 controls on this you don't ever really look at a detail in question like is this correct?  Or is this not you know, it's more like So I feel like but it just gives you like okay Wow, they're doing a lot right and that's kind of like the feeling of it And then there is a section there where you can be like why would request more information on something specific that maybe they didn't see in that 47, right?  But I think that it's Ideally that would be it like Mm-hmm So I'm trying to synthesize but if you see my screen if you see that I'm not capturing exactly the nuance of what you're telling me Just correct it

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because one of the things you just mentioned now, which is these requests for more information. I mean, this is not the idea generation phase, but the idea came up.  So I'll share it. It's also an opportunity for us to help them figure out what they need to know, like find a sky idea, right?  So there's an AI that you talk to it and says, oh, I need more information. Oh, why do you need that information?  Oh, okay. So that's interesting for you. Okay. Okay. So we have this thing, which is not exactly the same thing, but maybe it's useful for you.  So there's an aspect like a wizard or an assistant that writes newbies or outsiders to figure out what thing makes the most sense for them.  I don't know. There's perhaps. Yeah, can be.

17:46 - A L
  I think maybe in the future, wouldn't be like our first step, but definitely. think a lot of what we create can just be like an AI wizard that kind of brings everything through, you know, instead of all of these different boxes that guides you through it.  I've seen some kind of company do that. But yeah, so I think, for me, I think it's more of a, a lot of companies actually don't have this right now.  So like you're on a static page showing everything that they're doing in a cool format will be kind of new, right?  We haven't really seen this in the compliance space yet, but we've seen it in the security and privacy space.  But even if you see those, those are kind of boring like the back-to-one or the sprint-to-one that we have on our own website.  yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And there's, I mean, there's like the AI because AI is magic, right? It's the easiest idea. But there's other ideas that are not AI-based and we could, I think, implement them really easily.  For instance, if we have like integrity hub dash investor, it just loads with information that is relevant for investors.

18:42 - A L
  That's kind of cool.

18:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then you have like different, yeah, integrity hubs with different stakeholder groups.

18:47 - A L
  That's also pretty cool, too.

18:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Of different holders, okay. Cool, cool. Anything else you want to add to this thing, in terms of like your assumptions, how you think about this?  No, I think so.

19:07 - A L
  Okay. So in terms of, do you want to organize them here?

19:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because the other time we have a way more. So we needed to organize them from high confidence to low confidence.  Yeah.

19:18 - A L
  Yeah, I don't... I think evidence-based will lead more to trust. That's why high confidence there. I think showing what we do leads to interruption out of blue requests.  Yeah, I might save a little bit of time. There are probably requests will still happen, but maybe we'll save some time for that.  We'll lead to more sales. I don't know. We haven't done the sales process and then could experience expected. Yeah, that could be...  I'm not sure, but for that one, maybe it's there somewhere. Yeah, around there. Okay. Cool.

20:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, in terms of the integrity we have and how we serve different people, we thought about making a decision that is like a fork in the road for the workshop, okay?  So there's an aspect of it which is more about internal employees, which is kind of B2C, like bragging about, making their families understand what they do, and all of this sort of thing.  And the other aspect is like a bit more blue-cheap corporate state thing, the investors. And they are different, they have different aspects to it.

20:33 - A L
  Which one do you think we should focus on first?

20:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because we already know stuff about the compliance officer. This is less of an unknown area for us.

20:43 - A L
  I think it's more investor external stakeholders, like I kind of like it's not just investors, but it could be like supply chain people or customers, it can be like, so it's like external stakeholders, I would call it.  One is like internal employees, and then the other one would be external stakeholders.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, but so let me challenge you on that so would because external stakeholders. I agree different aspect to it But it's quite different being a vendor or being like an investor, right?

21:11 - A L
  So they are there they're external both, but they're different Right, because I think that like you're gonna have to do one external then it should be the customer like like because investors are you and far in between like Like they it's not gonna make that much of a difference, but it's more like for so like customers where where you where like If we want to change compliance to a competitive advantage rather than a cost center Then it's good to use customers because then the customers they can use it art on there You know on their bids and when they're quite a qualified when they're trying to say How do you differentiate us from our competitors can be like well?  I'm doing all of these look how great we are You know you can trust us because we do this and we have all of the information that does that so I would like if we have to Do external stakeholders, but I think  The same ones for customers is also the same with investors because you're saying like, hey, you can trust us, right?  You can you can invest money as you can buy our product because we're doing all of these great things So I think that's kind of the The external part about it and then and then employees will like it because they want to be able to Ride more sales and they want to be proud of their company.

22:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So something like that Okay Perfect so in terms of the customers Tell me more about which kind of customers you're thinking about so it's the customers of the companies is beat you be to see this Any kind of company like that is trying to sell or use a Reason like you know why why you know, I do you want to work with any kind of company, right?

22:56 - A L
  It's like, you know, do they have the have the right price?

22:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are they good people?

22:59 - A L
  Yeah, like Like do you trust them, right? So it's like you make like this into one of your selling points.  It's like, okay Yeah, our price is this you get everything else seems the same to our competitor. Like, you know, our competitor is also very Experienced they also have a really cheap price.  Okay. What else is a differentiator? Okay here? You can trust us and that we've done all of different things.  We're good for the environment We have an external audit for this. We have this under control working with us You're not gonna have to worry about a reputational issue or you're not gonna have to you know Worry about like some kind of scandal because you have to be taking care of it because we you know We've done this so that's kind of like a like a selling point for the company.

23:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay Okay Okay Yeah, compare it like that look look good.

23:57 - A L
  I would say look good externally

24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's their brand reputation Okay Okay When Clients okay Do you think there's an aspect of a Better expression escaped escapes me so covering your  like oh I hired the good guys Yeah, exactly.

24:43 - A L
  I think there is something to that, you know, it's like a Yeah, I think it's like I don't know what book covering your  internally, but also externally like you know look we you know Yeah covering the  and also justifying another like oftentimes internal, you know procurement people they need to justify why  We went with one company over there, Like, okay, it's because of this, know, like they have all of these, you know, external certifications, look at all of these controls.  We can trust that it's done, they're using Fortify, which other big companies are using this Fortify too, so we can do that, like so, something like that.  Okay.

25:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay. Anything else in terms of in the mind of the customer?

25:37 - A L
  I think it's like, look good externally, but also look good internally. It's also, you know, do you want to be showed to your employees or new recruits, you know, it's like all the positive things about your company that you're investing in these things.  Like, look good internally, or two recruits, you know, new people they want to recruit. But that's not for the customers, that's for...  Yeah, that's, okay, sorry, for the customers. That's okay.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or for the employees, I guess, yeah, okay, so I'll separate that I'll just create a little bit of a Okay I'll change the core of these things And then like you answer any questions What are they what are they they're trying to answer any questions that the customer may have with the minimal amount of impact of business?

26:40 - A L
  So customers come to them and say like hey like I give us your environmental policy and all your different things or whatever And they can just be like here's look at my link versus like okay.  Let me answer your questionnaire, you know 50 times so like it helps Like for the customer they're able to get the information that they need quicker  rather than bothering the business, or if you look on the internal side, it prevents somebody from internally having to spend a lot of money and time on it.

27:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there's like three posts, it's in my head right now. So for the customer, this is about getting the information.

27:17 - A L
  The customer gets the information that they need to answer whatever question that they have, or easy way to get it, like a more like direct way.  And then internally, for the employee, how is it useful for the employee is that it saves them time from having to look up this information, because they can just be like, go look at this link, and we have it there.

27:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's also, I think, I suppose, that there's also an aspect of information you can trust, right? Because it's up to date.  If this is an Excel file in some email... Yeah, that's up-to-date information, that's a good point, yeah. A single source of truth.  Yeah. Cool. So coming back to the customers, what do you think the customers in this context would consider success?

28:33 - A L
  I would say get their information that they need quickly and easily. And a lot of people don't like asking for this information, they just need to check a box that it is actually not...  So they're able to access and find information quickly, not have to chase people because that happens sometimes, right? You send like 20 page questionnaire and then people don't take time to respond to it and then they're chasing it.  Verification and then the other one would be like verification or validation that... It's working that they have a working process, you know, like, like that would be the external audit, like, you know, if you have an external audit from an ISO that says, like, yes, the process is working, then, you know, you can do it that way.  Mm-hmm.

29:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To me, there's an aspect of getting confirmation that they hired the best company they could.

29:50 - A L
  Yeah, yeah.

29:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're probably comparing several proposals and they need to make a decision and if it comes down to this. The idea that, we chose the right guys is important.  Yeah.

30:26 - A L
  And then one thing is about their supply chain for larger companies or investors or whatever, is like feeling that they're working with a good company.  You know, it could be the feeling secure about their trades, but they're feeling like, you know, people want to work with good companies, right?  They want to work with clean companies. They don't want to work with like bad reputation companies. So you can kind of be proud of like, I don't know, your value chain.  don't know. Like that's like really important that you need to prove that your value chain is good. Right? Like that.  So this would be like a good way for them to prove that.

31:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm trying to keep this a little bit mutually exclusive, what they're trying to do and what's success. this idea that good companies, right, like they want like more and more that they're working with.  Yeah, so not messing up their value chain would make sense?

31:22 - A L
  Yeah, I guess not messing up, showing that they work with ethical companies, I guess.

31:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let's another idea. And I'm bored of these little coins. Cool. What do you think is making this this thing difficult for external customers?

32:08 - A L
  Right now or right now it's not easy to get this information. Right now because most people's website is very generic it's like we care about the environment here's our environmental policy so there's no like kind of proof for evidence that it's actually working and there's no consistent way of evaluating also even though we're kind of picking one but it's just like you get a you know a questionnaire that has a lot of time and you're not you're not getting detailed information on it and it's not consistent so at least we can like we can become the consistent way of people looking at different things being like you know look at everything that they have and I think that could be also very good.

32:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So did I get it here no consistent way of evaluating? Different companies, yeah. Okay, okay. In my mind, lot of the themes are...  There is information. It's just difficult to get and it's difficult to parse and difficult to verify. There's like all this...  We're not inventing information. We're not generating information. We're just putting it in a more easy to find, digestible, okay.  And then also, yeah, exactly.

33:35 - A L
  And it saves information for, you know, for internally, oftentimes customers or investors or whatever will send a questionnaire to like their contact point.  And then that contact point has to find the internal contact point responsive for ESG. And then that person has like so many other things on their task.  So then they're not prioritizing it. But the other people might need to find this information to be applied for their bid and like give the information to the customer in a timely manner.  So it's like, I think that's what... If you know this, I guess if you say why is it good if they're able to get what they want very quickly versus like going to like on top, guess if you go if you go up, then it's like you save time, I think like why they find it considered success is there, but yeah, I we have that maybe like you get information.  Yeah, no way one on the left is like a key success factor because that's usually probably what they're most annoyed at, right?  That it takes a long time to find the person for them to respond to get them the information they need so that they continue working.  yeah, yeah, that's a classic, right?

  You start talking to a guy, takes two days to reply that the other guy takes two days to reply and eventually you need like two weeks to figure out what is the right person to talk to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The sources, sources, I think. Okay, would you really agree with this? Yeah, I think that's good.  Okay, so we added some stuff here just in terms of not to forget. Some of the feedback that was on the Miro was around the detail aspect of it, right?  what it made us think was maybe compliance offers, like the curse of knowledge or the curse of expertise. So the compliance officers, they want really detailed things, but then becomes impossible for other people.  And it seems to us that probably this means that 45 might need to be a little bit opinionated on this and say like, this is what should be shown.

35:49 - A L
  And there's a reason why we believe this. Yeah, and I think there's almost kind of like two, one is like statistics that you could be five whistleblowing cases or six of interest requests.

35:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's like,

36:00 - A L
  probably what the compliance officers would want, like the or like eight controls. Whereas the one that I copied and pasted in most companies that like I would say don't have sustainability or compliance officers, they would pride for that one because it's kind of list out everything that they do.  And then you don't need to like ask, you know, it's like we have it under control here with our documentation.  A lot of compliance officers or sustainability officers might not have exactly the same document in an ISO because they do it their own way, right?  They're not trying to get an ISO certification. So they might like so I think I think it's I agree.  But I think we will be able to work that out for pilots and kind of discuss it with them.  We can kind of bring one idea and then they can be like, I agree or not. But I think there's probably enough data points we can pull in there possibly.  Got it.

36:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Understood. So if the thing is automatically generated and if at some point some aspect of it that is a comparison.  Yeah.

37:00 - A L
  In Vankta and Sprintill, they allow you, like you kind of being like, you have an edit page and it's like, do you want to, which parts of these do you want to share, right?  So it generates everything and then you can decide, you can decide, like, I don't, I only want to share the graphs or I only want to share the controls, like, so kind of pick and choose.  I think it in that way. So I think, so I think we should do something like that, you know, like, what do you want to share?  Do you want to share? Like, pick and choose. These are the different things, put it all out or not.  Okay.

37:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And as well, this self-explanatory, because in its discussion, it's very easy to see that the integrity hub could become a huge thing, right?  especially for launch, there's probably something that's really, there's a lot of leverage to it that would be enough to get people to understand the idea and be open to, okay, this will grow.

37:58 - A L
  Yeah. Yeah. And I think if you. look at Vanto or Sprinto and what they have like Sprinto you can look at our website where our trust center is it's extremely simple like I think Vanto is there but even if you like you know I think one of the selling points is like just even on the top it's like you know X company is using Vanto which is blah blah blah blah you know it kind of explains what they're doing which is a leading you know trust certifier blah blah blah that works in X amount of country like so there's even like a selling point that can just be in the header and then the rest can just be statistics right so I it's very simple there okay I really like that because that is a very easy from a technical standpoint it's very easy to change just change the so what aspect of the page and and people can you know create your own story

39:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay got it. So we went and looked for the for the Spotify reps and we read some stuff and read some articles and also both external analysis and also internal analysis from the Spotify team which was really interesting because it has been around for a while right and it's a product they probably have like 50 people working on it or many journey people.  So there's a limit to how much we can compare but there's some aspects of it like some some primitives that felt interesting.  So basically the way we see it is that Spotify Rept is an industry report which is an old model of sharing information about something right every year you collect information and then you share a report on it.  Spotify Rept is basically that but it's community based and it has great branding right. It seems like there's more to it, but it's the basic aspects to it, and some of the things that we figure out that were around Spotify Rep, there's more images and videos here, but I don't think we should go there now.  One of them is a personalization, right? It speaks to you and there's also an aspect that connects with that, which is like the self-identification.  I see myself as like people sharing their Myers-Briggs profile, right?

40:33 - A L
  And they actually did something like this, like what's your kind of listening, and they invented their own Myers-Briggs.

40:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's also an aspect of anticipation, which I think is quite different from the integrity hub, because anticipation, like we know the year.

40:55 - A L
  like every quarterly one, like it's been updated, or like yeah, self-identification. be hard, because at least if you look at the controls, a lot of the controls are very similar, unless there's something around like, I submitted a conflict of interest request, you know, like, and there's like something that you've done, like, yeah, depending on how active you were in the, yeah, it could be actually how active you were on the tool, right?  Like, in employees, like, I've completed all your trainings, you've done all of these things on a time, then you get a score.  Yeah, maybe by the score. And then at the of the year or at the end of the quarter, you can be like, depending on your score, I'm a superstar, I'm a helper, I'm not, you know, something like that on like, and that's could be based on their submissions, because every employee has to check off the policy, every employee has to check off the training, you know, they have to submit controls or do the annual conflict of interest.  the more they do that, and then the score, and then you can be like, hey, I'm on compliance, something, and then like, know, and score, you know, and then like, share it or something.

41:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So there's also this aspect of being shareable because it provides you with the assets that you can share low.  Here's the story, the Instagram story you can share, right? It's really easy for that. And there's also a little bit of phone mode because you don't want to be the last of your friends to share this thing, right?  Yeah. Self-identification and self-expression, I think, because you see yourself like, oh, I listen to a lot of, I don't know, weird music that makes me special.  Okay. Obviously, community-driven. This is very easy to understand. But some aspects of this stuff are a little bit more difficult to translate into our world, right?  Let me just share some numbers here. in 2021, there were 120 million users sharing their Spotify reps. And this was a big jump from previously on 2017, right?  So it's a huge success. And it's not a single thing, right? The Spotify rep is kind of a campaign or like a set of products.  Yeah, yeah.

43:12 - A L
  And one of the things that this is just some excerpts, there's more stuff here if you want to.

43:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But this aspect really caught my eye, the blueprint for marketing, right? So there's a reason why so many people are copying Spotify Rep and we're having this conversation.  But if there's a desire to dive deeper into this, I think. Yeah, I also like it because of the sharing.

43:43 - A L
  It's also a good way to promote the company. So it's not sharing for the brag myself, but it's showing I'm proud of my company.  If you go based on submissions, I've done my part to help make X company really great. And then the company is going to like that too, right?

43:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because they're going to have more social media.

44:00 - A L
  from their employees, talking about how great their company is because they've done this, know, and they've fortified just a small link in between that, like, it's more of like a picture or whatever, you know, like, you can get a badge at the end of the year or the badge of a quarter being like this, how you participated in this, you know, it's, I think in the beginning it'll be fewer, but I think as more people, but it could be really interesting.  And like, you can get companies to like encourage people to, you know, post about it and stuff. Mm-hmm.

44:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Absolutely. Oh, yeah. I can see that. So the things that we feel that are a little bit different is it's not ongoing, it's a campaign.  It's Spotify Raph is mostly about the personal aspects. mean, there is this personal aspect that we just started to draft here, but it's mostly yeah, these would have to be designed from scratch because the other the other thing the company information is more readily available.  It's very design-having, and the funny thing is that they use data, but it's not really about data, right? It's about something else, and I think that is very interesting for B2C, and for B2B might be different, right?  And another aspect that we felt is quite different is companies usually are very protective of the way they show up in the world, right?  So if they want to veto stuff and work with PR firms and all sorts of things, that probably will sanitize a lot of the quirkiness of what we could do.

45:44 - A L
  I think that's changing, I feel like, especially for smaller companies. There's more and more about in-led marketing, and they can't control everything centralized anywhere, so I don't necessarily that is.  I think if they agree to, like, if we show, like, these are all the choices that they make. please can give you know when they like then they'll be okay with it I do think like in like in terms of like the percentage it could be like top what like for employees it could be like top 1% top 3% you know I'm top 1% of involved employees in the company or something like that and then they get there right you know like so doesn't need to be number of submissions but like top 1% you could be like you know I was top 1% filling out my stuff correctly I don't know what it is like you can make something up so I think that can I think that going back to what you said I do think that they're because of that that actually the personal thing is kind of cool in that because if they're actually one of our tools we have a challenge with our tool is that we touch every employee or like we touch many stakeholders or different things so you know we bother them by saying you need to check out this policy you need to put in this control you need to review this thing like that and the gain that they get might have to this right that they've actually done stuff and they've done it on  time and they've done different things and like in terms of the campaign like we're going to miss you know we're going into this new year so it's not going to happen and I don't know if we want to wait one more year until next Christmas you know to do it maybe it could be like a six month thing or like it could be like or like yeah or some some kind of we can like purposely set a date or every quarter or twice a year like you know you do something and they could also be like linked to like maybe awards or like different things like if you think about these points like it's not only bragging rights but then the company also will reward the top 5% of the company you know like giving gifts cards or doing different things and like I'm not uh yeah it could be like quarterly awards sometimes you see that in companies it's like I'm you got the ethical award for you know doing this this quarter right like that often happens um in companies so you can yeah do something around performance cycles or different things there got it got it so this thing I get that is a little bit not so much of an issue

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I also assume that this goes together with it. Yeah. OK. Cool. OK. So the idea now is that, how could we bring these things to our context?  And some of the things we already have, because we've been sharing them, having these ideas right now. OK. Self-identification, community-driven.  Oh, wait. I don't want to delete them. I want to just copy them. Community-driven comes here. Self-identification comes here.  Campaign-based. Based. Mm. Okay, sorry, selecting which data is presented, okay. Okay, so we brought everything that was up there and we can now do this again.  So maybe we can generate some ideas around how to hit on this 365 that Spotify Rept has, right. Can we perhaps set a timer for that?  it be okay for you? Certainly, thought of something.

49:54 - A L
  Because we have both the employee portal and we have the integrity hub, right? Correct, yeah. Like, could some of the Spotify rap be in the employee portal, then it's somehow linked to the integrity hub, you know what I mean?  you would see, I'm just thinking like the personalization and all of the employee information, it would be through their employee hub and then you get it, but then somehow it links to like Spotify, then it links to the external page, you know what I mean?  Yeah, it is a little bit different in terms of the personalization on the external page, the external page is kind of static, right?  it's like, you know what mean? So I'm trying to think about like how they can be kind of combined in that and to encourage employees to go into the employee portal, you can have like a, like here's your rap or here's a summary of how you're doing, share how cool you are, or like you're in the top one or five percent.  And that could be also a reporting for management, like look at your top one to five percentage of, it's always so hard and compliance to find out who's doing what at the right time.  Now you suddenly have a summary. Like these are your five employees that are reporting. putting the most, doing it on time, doing it the fastest, that you don't need to chase up, know, and that they get an award on that.  And that could be the employee portal, maybe, then the actually integrity hub. But it's also like, yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense.

51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  let me bring this up here. So let me explain this. basically, the overall interaction is people, users are sending information.  This information is being collected in a database, right? And then decision makers have access to this information, right?

51:36 - A L
  This is company data.

51:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  when company A does this, you have company data. When you have multiple companies, you'll have proprietary, like from 45s market data, right?  But this will take a while because you need a certain critical mass for this. Also have like third party market data, like industry reports, regulatory studies, think tank reports, investor reports, the sort of thing.  And the question is, what can we do with this company-wide data? And there's two, I'll just go into it and then we explore.  We have some data, and we can use that data to pursue some business objectives. And there's data about policies, training, audits, reporting, whistleblower controls, and more stuff.  It is more granular than this. And then we can use that data for business objectives that are different depending on who we are serving, right?  Combine investors, employees, investors, and stuff like that. And if this is the mental model we have, which is like, oh, I love the culinary analogy of the mise en place.

52:54 - A L
  I'm going to cook something.

52:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You see what you have in your fridge. And then you come out with this.

53:00 - A L
  That's possible, right?

53:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think this would be a way of connecting that thing you're saying of there's the employee data and like employee profile and the employee bragging rights.  And there's like the company data, the company profile, the company compliance and adherence to difference.

53:20 - A L
  Yeah, like an investor or a customer isn't going to care that employee X is the top 1% tile, right?  Like for the company itself might care, because I want to see, I want to value my top five employees and give them a thing.  So the company might care to know with those numbers. Employee will probably care because that's a motivation, like a gamification of seeing how good they are in a bragging right.  then the external investor or customer might not care, but they might like to be on LinkedIn and see like a customer, an employee bragging about how they do ESG in this company, because that also becomes marketing for the customer that's going to be working with them.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

53:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the employee profile. It's more like, okay, it's just as an algae, right? Like Spotify Raps. Yeah. And the company profile is something different.

54:13 - A L
  Yeah, it's, it could be its own like Spotify Raps, but very like static, know, like this information isn't gonna change per people, but like per all of these things, cause like in all of these controls aren't gonna do it.  So it's like Spotify, I don't know what it, it's like a cooler website, I guess, or something like that, like that.

54:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is what I'm thinking. The Spotify Raps is Spotify creating value from something they already had, which was the data on listening, you know, okay.  And if, but the Spotify Raps, like for instance, what would be the Vanta of Spotify Wrapped, right? I guess it could be a page that shows pure data.  No story telling. Just like, I've listened to a thousand hours of this thing, I've listened to all of these songs, I've listened to this, I usually start listening between this and this time, like really just data oriented, right?  Not packaged into something interesting. Yeah, I think it could be like, so if you think about all of the text I put in the chat, right?

55:28 - A L
  that could maybe be on the back end an additional click, like if they want to like see what you did, but like the front page of it, we could be like, we have 16 controls, you know, and then they click on it, and then they see the list of all of the stuff, you know, or we have 48 whistleblowers, like it could be like a visualization of the statistics, and then when you click in, you see the boring stuff behind it, saying like, you know, this is the, so there's like a hip cooler version of it, and then like, but then behind it, or like on a nice separate tab, then you have actually all of the information.  So it's almost like a front page of Vanta, you know, Vanta has all of the boring information in there, and that's kind of  shows you what we had before there's like one front page either you toggle or that becomes the front page and be like this is kind of cool this is what we do this is why we care and like like important things like that mm-hmm so okay so like a summary page or like a cool summary page cool summary yeah memory and comprehensive data right the cool summary it's a little bit like Spotify reps and the comprehensive data is a little bit like like Sprintow or like Sprintow what they already have there okay and when it comes to the employee profile we only have the cool summary right that's a difference yeah I think it then it's only the cool summary because if they want to know the details they can go to the company profile but like more kind of cool summary for themselves and and that I think yeah

57:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, okay, this is helpful for me, cool. Given that these things are a little bit different, and what do you think we should focus on first?  Like this aspect, the employee aspect or the company aspect?

57:24 - A L
  I do the company one. Okay. Yeah. So, cool.

57:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To me, it makes sense as well. So, with this in mind, we're focusing on the company. Employee portal next, right?

57:42 - A L
  Like we're doing integrity hub now and then there's a section on employee portal. Like that's like one of the next lines, right?  Isn't it? Yeah, we did the...

57:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, that was a good photo. Okay, last time I was going to say this could have, yeah, this could be in that.

57:58 - A L
  Did we do the employee portal last week? Yeah, so yeah, that could be like, like for the next version of that employee portal or something like that, you know, yeah.

58:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. So let me just not lose that.

58:16 - A L
  Because there could be one more design on the employee portal meaning like, you know, fortify wrapped, you know, you can call it that or something like that, you know, and they could be like a page where they pull in the summary, you know.  Mm-hmm.

58:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so with this in mind, if we for now, it's relatively easy to think about how this could be implemented, not implemented, how this could be unfolded throughout the whole fortify experience, right?  But just so we really nail down the more corporate aspect, my suggestion is that we do this, but focusing on  company profile, right? Okay, let's focus on the company profile. Okay, company profile. So now, considering the company profile, when you think about personalization, selecting which data is presented, like what Santa does.  Yeah, okay.

59:28 - A L
  It could be, yeah. Yeah, no, I think that's what you would need to do in the beginning. Okay.

59:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So self identification, to me, feels less relevant in terms of the company profile. Yeah. How do you feel about this?

59:44 - A L
  I don't think that like, yeah, maybe like it could be with their logo and different things on it, but I don't think it needs to have anything.  Uh, basic, uh, logo, all right.

1:00:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the logo, what's color, I don't know. Yeah, color, something like that. shareable, well, this is like a one-stop shop, not shop, one-stop page for multiple stakeholders.  Oh, I've also, I've added some, where did I put it? That's it, some ideas for, like, share buttons, of course.  Yeah, got it. Okay, share buttons. Committee driven. One of the things that I have written down here, I don't know how we feel about this.  Some sort of leaderboard aspect, comparing to other companies from 4 to 5. Or maybe the percentile. I think it's going to be hard, at least in the beginning, to get enough data for that.

1:01:35 - A L
  But committee driven. It could be also good with FOMO inducing, Vanta and Sprinto have on their entrance page. It lists out the companies that they're also working with.  So you're almost like hopping on the name of a more experienced company, right? So it's like, we are using Fortify, an ESG managed tool that works with the likes of, you know, Tellinor Office Solutions, all of these bigger companies that like kind of also show, like kind of it's a, showing that they're, you're, you're working with a reputable company and they're working with a tool that's reputable that they can kind of brag about.  And so I don't know if that's FOMO inducing or like community driven, but being like, they're not the only one using this tool, you know, like there's other people that are using it.  I don't know if that is a way.

1:02:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I've heard is, let's imagine like my company Yeah. has a Fortify DaGardy Hub. And I send this link to my clients and they check it out and they say, oh, João's company is working with the same software that Tellinor uses.

1:02:50 - A L
  Exactly.

1:02:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:02:52 - A L
  And they have that on like, Vanda has it on like the first line and then they also use it to kind of sell themselves, right?  Like Venta is one of the first leading trust

1:03:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Integrity hubs working with this many companies in this country, you know like this So then it feels like a little bit more like working with a cup not just like Abby shoes store on the side You know like I like I can actually reputable and trust, you know the information that I give you because they're working with these large companies Kind of like that Let me see how I since it has that but Include Information You In my mind is more FOMO inducing because it's not necessarily interactive right when I think about communities or even I think there's like some social sort of Social interaction So  Yeah, no, I don't know. I think there's an aspect of community, not community driven, but the shareable aspect which is it's likely that some companies will have their own, I don't know, PDF reports stored somewhere, some other platforms that they use, right?  Yeah. It feels to me that it would be useful for them to allow for one button in their integrity hub that says, oh, if you want to see more about our stuff, click here.  There's a video of our CEO or, you know.

1:04:48 - A L
  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sending, like allowing them. Yeah, exactly. There could be like something shareable, or like here's a summary, you know, like a summary of all of our activities that's easily shareable.  not just like a website, but here are the key, the Q1 pager or key like shareable points. You know, and then that can go to a like a Spotify raps, you know, share the one page summary with your, you know, like if I'm like working in Mao, like, hey Mao, you want to share you the company out this link and have a highlight reel of this like link page for the link.  You look at VAMP10 and that you're not able to really capture everything, right? There's like 47 controls on this, 83 controls on this and like, but if you have like a Spotify rap cool one being like a summarized that they have 87 controls and they're doing this and they like, you know, like a easier shareable version, then that could be good.  Or it could be like a summary video about what they are or how they care about ESG and stuff.  It could be like a video around that, that's shareable. I'm not sure.

1:05:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But in that sense, if we're going back to the reps. So what I mean, what I'm thinking is like, I'm a client, right?  I am thinking about how Mauricio is a client. Mauricio is thinking about. hiring my company. And Mauricio is checking out my Fortify integrity hub, right?  Mauricio is like, oh, there's so much information I need from this guy. Why would Mauricio share like the reps for my company?  It doesn't doesn't serve him, I think. It means where if Mao is where I've sent him my integrity hub link.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:34 - A L
  So I'm checking it out.

1:06:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If I if I look at this from the perspective of Mao, there's no point in Mao sharing my own rep thing.

1:06:45 - A L
  But there's other things they might I think it depends right like it like because like if Mao is like trying to convince internal stakeholders that like sort of like, you know, your company is the one who works.  Yeah, it's one like a nerd like like depends on who the company is, right? If it's a nerd. they'll want the more detailed one and they just want the link.  If you're like a more senior manager type person that just wants a gut feel around how this company is, then they will probably more prefer the summary one with access to that link, do know what I mean?  Like it automatically summarizes everything for them. Possibly that'd be the only difference because sometimes I feel like with the Vantyte there's so much information you're like I don't know what to deal with this.  So like if you're like a wrapped version then you're like okay this is cool, this is a company but I would say like if you had to pick one then I would rather have the comprehensive version than the lighter version on there.  Like yeah so I can share about executive summary to people with the details if they want it there. So kind of you eat it immediately, yeah.

1:07:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah so for instance Mao comes to my integrity hub and Mao needs to defend the decision of hiring my company and like oh man I just want to take a screenshot of this thing and put it in my PowerPoint but I can't.  or it won't look good or something. Just download some reports that it comes with three big headers like, oh, they've done this thing, they've done this thing, then there's like the data if they want more stuff.

1:08:16 - A L
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it would be one slide around, and you know, like, you know, your company's ESG activities, like download here, so I can put it into my presentation.  Yeah, okay.

1:08:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like that to put on the presentation, right? To include... include in presentation. This is great because this could be just like really an image, and if Fortify generates an image, it can always put a like a watermark on it, like data, Fortify.

1:08:47 - A L
  Yeah, yeah.

1:08:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Community driven... Oh, there's an aspect of asking questions, right? Yeah. Okay. That's the checklist section for requesting.

1:09:00 - A L
  And then also there is like, I don't know if like this integrity hub is going to become the portal for suppliers or investors to ask questions like they can log in and like I don't know if we need to do like like as part of the supply chain management you might have to have a meeting with them where they might need to solve a question respond to a questionnaire.  So would they go through the portal and this portal you know integrity hub going here and like fill in and fill in their survey or I'm not sure but this is like a thinking about it.  So it's kind of a central hub like there's a Norwegian transparency act because it's like a rule that came out which is similar to an EU regulation where anybody has the right to ask you about your supply chain you know and like you have to have a place on your website where people can request information on that so that can be a place and where you're supposed to put a report about what you're doing so people can actually find it that's the regulation so this could be part like it's a it's a hub where like people can ask questions or find the information that they need.

1:09:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this would be addressing even like regulation. By putting a button to say, oh, I want to know more.  Yeah.

1:10:05 - A L
  OK, this is good.

1:10:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In terms of anticipation, I think for the output facing, I don't see much, to be honest, because it's an ongoing thing.  OK, let me zoom out. So anything else that stands out to you?

1:10:38 - A L
  No, I don't think so.

1:10:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so now I'll pick up these things, copy them, and then bring into the V0, because I understand that it will change.  It was just something to have a conversation around. That is very clear. So we just bring it here and figure out what can we keep from this and how that would be.  OK.

1:11:15 - A L
  So even though white is quite difficult to keep, like the Q1 status, because that's just kind of like, I think that's like not going to make sense, because it was more like a way to like also is something that we can maybe build in later on.  But it's like, you have to do certain steps, right? Because like, I think the worst thing is for like company to like, you know, stop doing it.  know, it's like, oh, I got this certification. I'm going to stop doing it. Right. So it's like, there's almost like a status, like a status.  Like Vanta has something like this where you see green, yellow and red, you know, so you can see that they're always up to date on it.  So that was kind of like the Q1 status. But that can be somewhere else, I think, to show that they're like, you know, if they haven't used the tool in three months, then it should automatically turn yellow for us, you know, like there should be  that I don't want them to also start using that for greenwashing right like they just pay the money for the tool and they don't actually do the work and then they get to use this right so it has to be kind of linked to the work that they do or like that they're actively using it so that's where the Q1 status came from but that could be just like a yellow or like a green or like Q1 Q2 Q3 for Q4 and then it's like green you can like you can see the status of it activities.

1:12:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Why is it a circle right now? I'm not saying it will always be a circle but what was the thinking behind being a circle?

1:12:34 - A L
  I think in compliance there's a term called the annual wheel so it's like a what do you do every quarter like what do you do every yeah so that thing that's probably where the wheel came from it's kind of showing that it's like a circular thing but it yeah I'm based based on the annual wheel  And then the topic areas that you see there, those are kind of like, I would say you can build out on, you know, what I copied and pasted into there, you know, like on the chat, that would be like the topic areas for E.  You would have like, you know, 16 different areas, you know, like that you would put in there in the middle, in the middle one in the topic areas.  Yeah, like those. Like that would be just for E.

1:13:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll think out loud now. Yeah. It's relatively easy for us to make a page that just has a list of requirements.  And if they're, you know, green or not, not green, this is relatively straightforward, which V, I would imagine like the venta like detailed view, right?  Yeah.

1:14:06 - A L
  So, perhaps be like, well, I think the detailed view would be the topic areas, you know, like, you know, all of those lines that I gave you right now, that's like the detailed view.  And that may be a toggle, right? And then like the Q1 status is more of like the high level summary of it, maybe.  Okay, okay.

1:14:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the shareable summary would be that.

1:14:30 - A L
  And then the detailed one would be the topic areas. So, you could almost also just like toggle between them.  Okay.

1:14:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool, cool, cool. And so, like this thing is the back of this thing, the topic areas?

1:14:54 - A L
  Okay.

1:14:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking, Okay. The topic is the back. But the summary could be like, do 16 topic areas within E.

1:15:06 - A L
  We do 18 around G. We've had eight whistleblowing cases, 100% employee training. That could be almost like the dashboard kind of thing for that, and then in between the background or something like that.

1:15:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In terms of, OK, so this doesn't exist yet, but we could put something here. The basic identity is probably here.  One-stop page for multiple stakeholders.

1:15:42 - A L
  One on the right, like the summary one. Yeah, the whole thing is a one-stop shop kind of, the whole integrity hub is a one-pager for that, guess.  Like one linker.

1:15:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But there's, I just closed the window, shouldn't just say that. I see, I see it. Now, because I want to bring something from the Figma, it's loading up, just a second.  Okay, okay, it's open, now, oh yeah, here, this thing, this thing, this thing. So, imagine this sort of element, this element here, okay, this thing.  But instead of saying this stuff, it just says the stakeholders, okay? So you shift between stakeholders, oh, if I'm an investor and you check the information.  Yeah, possibly, yeah. In that way, it would just, you know, turn on and off different. I'm not entirely sure I understand what's the scope thing.

1:17:10 - A L
  Yeah, that is actually more of the award bragging. so if you did ISO 27, like 37,001, like right now we only have actually two 14,001 and 37,001.  So if you said that would be where you put the like award, you know, you could take a screenshot of the ISO like flag or something that you can put in there bragging that you've been externally audited and you passed.  So that's kind of like the certification page that you would have like a certification bragging page. Like we got 14,001 compliant external auditor like that.

1:17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So realistically speaking, this is kind of the badges area, right? Like the big shiny iso logo kind of thing.  Okay, okay. usually strong badges. OK, because I would assume, I mean, there's many ways of dealing with what I'm going to say.  if people have just one or two, OK, it's easy to display two badges. If they're really good, if they're really good, maybe we need to select which ones appear, or we can also.  OK, so this gave me an idea. The process of getting to one of these is long, right? It takes a while.  Well, it takes nine to 12 weeks.

1:18:40 - A L
  our tool, the whole point is like, if you follow our tool, you will be able to be certified very quickly on these.  So that's the kind of point. It's like, you go through all of these trainings, policies, procedures, all of these things that I copied and pasted in that these are like the requirements to be able to pass these ISOs.  So we're like setting everything up for you, like templates, policies, setting it up so that you have. information to be able to pass it very quickly.  That said, this one I think is a little bit dangerous or maybe we need to put it in a place that can be hidden because not every company will want to do an ISO, so they might not have the certifications.  if you have a compliance officer, they do it off of their own methodology, right? But if you don't have a compliance officer, you just want to, you know, have an external verification saying that it's correct and then you want to right.  yeah, like I think the way that it's in like that or the sprint, it's kind of like some have it like, yes, we have it there, but then you could also decide, you know, not to show it, but then what would you have in there instead is another question.  Because what I was this week, like I think I invited you guys to the calls with our customers, you know, we'll ask them, like, you know, do you want to do 14,001, you know, do want to do 37,001, and you'll hear, like my guess is maybe three or four of them would want that, but it's not guaranteed.

1:20:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so in that sense, here's what I'm thinking. This space that we have right now is for tangible, provable achievements, right?  And the biggest example of those achievements are ISOs and stuff like that. But not everyone wants the ISO stuff.  So if they don't want the ISO stuff, what could we have here in terms of a bragging aspect? What I'm thinking is it could show something...  because a lot of what we've been saying is the evidence-based thing, right? So we should not allow this to be a free-for-all area where they just write stuff.  Just chances are they'll just write really boring stuff that nobody cares about because people struggle with writing interesting stuff.  So, on one end, we have this, if you do the ISO, you get a badge, like this one extreme, but some people are not interested in this, and on the other, on the other hand, we have on the other, and we have pre-for-all, just write what you want here, bragging rights.  Somewhere in the middle, there could be something where 45, when the compliance officer is setting up this integrity hub, 45 says, look, there's three things we've detected that you could probably brag about, right?  You could brag about, we've noticed that people respond really quickly, so this is a number you could put there, or, you know, just, yeah, in my mind, there's a lot of this dynamic of 45 being a trusted expert that helps you figure out what to put into things.  Doesn't it look like a web page maker, know, like, which is not...

1:21:58 - A L
  No, I think, I agree, you can, like, take... some of the dashboards that you can pull like you know from the data from the dashboard that you have and say you want to display it over there you know because we're going to have a lot of dashboards yeah um so yeah so that can be one it could also you can also use it to feature the compliance officer or sustainability officer you know so their picture is there or like a contact point is there so like people have questions and they can kind of brag that they're the contact point I don't know that could be there um not sure but I think the dashboards kind of makes sense um yeah okay so let's let's try to take one step back we have a visual I mean I understand this might not be the final visual it's okay but we have a card or we have an area that is really strong on a visual right we can go into the detail of that and you can also extract

1:23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  into a one pager, something that's easy to integrate with my own workflows, right? Then we also have the detailed view.  Might not be exactly in this position, but we need to have the detailed view at some point. We also have the , braggy, interesting things of look at all the things you're doing, right?  We also have a way of shifting between different audiences and this way is very resilient to change. If at some point we realize, oh, we need another profile, it's very easy to just add a button here.  We do have information that could be used on the bragging stuff as well. We don't have yet, but we could add the share buttons or more buttons to other...  Do other repositories? I'm thinking it feels that it would be interesting to add another cool engaging thing to the corporate version of the integrity hub, you know?

1:24:28 - A L
  Maybe that's what the dashboards are like. Could it be even like generic or does it have to be? I'm just like, why is it great that they're involved like something around ESG or like?  Yeah, could be generic, it's true, yeah. It could be like interesting facts, more companies need to do ESG to stop looking for me.  I don't know, like I'm just throwing out like some kind of like, this is why we care, or it could be some kind of corporate jargon.  And like, you know, is why, you know, Abby, Inc. cares about. And this is why we think it's really important or it could be like a quote.  It could be like a cool quote from the CEO You know like that they can put in There that like kind of drives in like that they can add in right you could just be like quote CEO Like why why this matters for us, you know why this is important for us or something like that?

1:25:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so there's different possibilities there So Newsly, so I'm not sure like I was something else you just said I didn't manage to write Oh, yeah, maybe maybe like numbers around like why these matters, right?  Oh Why this matters, you know, you know, like yeah, like you give me life

1:26:00 - A L
  company X cares about ESG because you know we're all gonna die in like 30 years or something like you know like sometimes you know quote about like why ESG is important or something like that and why why they're doing the investment here like you know my company you know we are investing into this tool because we you know blah blah blah you know and that it could be like that could be kind of fun like you know you have like lines that you have like we are investing in this we invest in ESG because of and so every company answered the question but the answer is slightly different you know so you kind of look forward to it's like you know we care about ESG because and then company X says this you know and then you go to the company Y is one and it's like we care about ESG because of that you know why and then you start to see like you know the line is the same but you it's kind of interested that you go in there I think an interesting thing is like if you want I just really thought about this if you want to go like on a it's almost like could you link to another company like you know see another company working in this space and then like you link to somebody else's integrity hub  So I'm kind of almost like scrolling, you know, but then it's like kind of an interesting way of like seeing like other companies doing the same thing.  And it's also a nice advertising for the other companies being like, I don't know how you would do that, but I guess the companies would need the permission for other ones or like, or do you want to see another list of other companies with working within a Tagli hub?  And then you can like link to them or something. I just think about the community field or whatever. Yeah.  I think you can do that on fortifies page.

1:27:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Like you could have you could have well in mind, but on a fortifies page, you could have like a button figure out a random company doing cool stuff and it opens, right?

1:27:39 - A L
  Yeah.

1:27:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah.

1:27:42 - A L
  So, it could be like, yeah, want to see other companies working with fortify and then to the link to fortifies page or something like that, you know, but I if I were the company, I would not.

1:27:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah.

1:27:54 - A L
  I was there. It's true.

1:27:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. So I think it's already gives us quite a bit to do Because behind each of these things, there's like decisions and flows that need to be thought about.  Okay, so this is the appropriate version of the integrity hub, right? We did not do the Spotify first employee version.  It feels to me, I mean, it's your decision. It feels to me that for the time frames you were talking about, nailing these things first would be better.  What's your take? Nailing what part first?

1:28:40 - A L
  The corporate aspect, not the personal. They the corporate aspect, yes.

1:28:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so in this context, we'll just go back into this thing, like what data could be shared. But basically what we're doing now is just  just around this, right? It's just on phase one. And it makes sense because we are on phase one, right?

1:29:05 - A L
  Just company data.

1:29:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We are not comparing company data with third-party market data. Yeah.

1:29:12 - A L
  For instance, imagine, we could have something like, oh, we are on this stage in communication, which is better than 17% of them.

1:29:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like maybe for the future, that's possible. And in the, as you get more stuff, this thing could start to compare even better to others.  Okay. So our idea for now, this is so much about around data. Our idea for now was thinking about which data could be shared and then figure out if we have it, if we don't have it, and if it's engaging or not.

1:29:51 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

1:29:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Could we do that now?

1:29:54 - A L
  Yeah.

1:29:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. We could do that for some of them.

1:29:57 - A L
  Okay. So what data can be shared? think you'd be like, 100% completion of employee training that's like we have is kind of boring though that can go in there but that's a very common one you know that you have um like saying with 100 percent completion of policy review and you know that um you have a number of controls being implemented could be another one uh controls implemented and then it could be even uh a number of whistleblowing requests that have come in uh question whenever a whistleblower request comes in i i i think the process right to get investigated or something like that right okay uh this is

1:31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm, for this investigation, is it the braggable thing? oh, we take two weeks to figure out.

1:31:08 - A L
  Yeah, it can be. We got to, yeah, people haven't been reporting that. But I think eventually you could, but I don't think we'll have that ready yet.  Because sometimes it's also not a fair comparison, because some are just so complex, and some are ridiculous, so then it takes a little time.  But yeah, but I think there's a lot, like, around whistleblowing requests. It could be, a number, like, time to close, country of, you know, country of whistleblowing requests.  I don't know if you want to share that. Maybe not.

1:31:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, within the controls, there's, like, conflict of interest.

1:31:39 - A L
  You know, a number of suppliers engaged, you know? That could be a number of engaged. Yeah, a number of environmental aspects identified.  You know, a number of environmental aspects identified. Number of legal registered. number of environmental aspects identified, number of legal reviews, something like that.  You can have different objectives and targets that you might want to add there. You can maybe have audit results, I don't know if you want to have that.  The number of people who have contacted the company or something, don't know, number of external contacts to the company, how many people requested information, I guess.  How many, like, number of employees actively participating in the program? I don't know how you count that, but that could be the number of external requests.

1:32:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would imagine that we could also have, because there's information that It's already would already be inside of 45, right?  So the time to getting to 100% employee completion, it's like fully, fully within 45, right? So we could say, oh, we got to 100% employee training.  Yeah, within four or two weeks or maybe two to do that, yeah. Okay, so this we can now mix with other things.  Let's go back to the, let's go back here and see if there's something.

1:33:46 - A L
  Number of risk identified or something. That could be interesting. I don't know. Number of risk identified and managed or something.

1:34:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's the gifts aspect, right? Yeah, those are all in the controls.

1:34:07 - A L
  I don't know if you want to talk about how many gifts you've given, it is a number of internal controls executed or something like that.  Yeah, number of control of records or something like the controls of records. Is that anything? think those are all the ones like the conflict of interest register, the government official register, you know, all of that.  can probably summarize it as like, you know, we have 18 controls or something like that, but not like the results of them.  Got it. I think there's some that's like just interesting for internal people, right, like to manage and that's all are going to be.  dashboard that we're already creating but then for external people they don't necessarily need to know all of the details you know yeah okay I guess I have a question like what would you like like what would the next and we can ask ask our pilot this you know like what do you care about if you're going to like look at a company and say like how good they are an esg like what is going to be interesting to you most of them will be like oh do they have policy they have the basics policies procedures trainings you know like are they doing the check the box on on that you know what is there some of this like we haven't really touched on like what is your carbon footprint like I don't want to do that because that's a whole nother exercise of finding out your carbon footprint but it's like what are the processes that you you're taking or like different things um but I think that's in like um yeah so I so I'm not sure yet I think it might come out a little bit clearer when we uh when we actually start running through  Through this process with some companies and like creating all of these like when we start creating all of these documents that I copied pasted in there You're gonna start listing out things right and like what they're doing and in that we will be able to find more statistics from that Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.

1:36:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Do will be a more Grounded exercise, right? mm-hmm. I Was thinking if there's like maybe some aspect of which Training I Don't know if this matters for the outsiders, right?  This is information that you have which is like of all the trainings people need to do. Oh like a time to onboarding somebody Right if you're a new employee and you need to do like the AML training and Whatever and you need to do like five trainings.  Yeah You know that people do that in 7.2 days, I don't know. Mm-hmm, yeah. Oh, okay, this is the thing.  Okay, I'm repeating myself. Okay, so... Time to this. the number of employees.

1:37:25 - A L
  Do we have that in there?

1:37:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Come again?

1:37:27 - A L
  The number of active employees, I guess, I don't know. We have employees actively participating. Yeah.

1:37:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:37:40 - A L
  So, okay.

1:37:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can we spread out these things? Yeah. Would you think it would be useful for now to figure out if...  to place things on this metric, or do you think it's best if we do something else?

1:37:55 - A L
  I think I would wait until, we know more of this stuff, and then we could just, like... leave a space for like interesting charts or something but then I think we can figure out you know what that is closer when we actually have all of the everything kind of built out I think.

1:38:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay so let's figure out what's what's the next thing like in terms of tasks right very specific things we should do with the integrity hub so based on what we've built here let's I'll zoom out actually did I send you the link yeah I think I did but I'll send you again anyone over the link can edit okay yeah sure copyboard link I'll send you again  Can you give me five minutes, because I need a little break and I'll be back, but we can use these five minutes to think a little bit about next tasks, like project-oriented things for putting together the integrity of it.  That's perfect. Okay. Thanks.

1:39:20 - A L
  Good.

1:39:21 - Mau Medeiros
  Okay. But I'll be back.

1:39:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay? I'll be back in five minutes. Yeah. Let's all do a break. Okay.

1:39:45 - Mau Medeiros
  Okay.

1:43:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so quickly, we, in terms of putting together the integrity hub, one of the things that we know we must do is, it's kind of obvious, but...  design the desktop version, but also design the mobile version of this. There's also an aspect of generating a one-page report for developing the reports downloadable.  We also need a way of selecting which data to present, of selecting data. This is not a trivial thing from a...  an experienced perspective, because this would mean like a whole flow for the compliance officer to do. So the more things we can do that are relatively automated and the later we need to focus on this, I think the best, the better.  Selecting data to present. It feels to me, and I'm just listing off these things to try to be helpful, but if you want to interrupt me, feel free.  It feels to me that designing the whole employee wrap thing would need more work perhaps later on. Okay, we need to  Select which data points are more interesting for customers. And there's probably an aspect of creating the technical routines for the collection and analysis.  Like to have something to put on the page, maybe we need to develop systems that every day they check out how each company is coming in with those numbers, Stuff like that.  Okay. Do you see anything else that I'm seeing here? Okay.

1:47:00 - A L
  Um No, I don't think so Oh Yeah, I think so Yeah so for the first In terms of the employee portal Not employee portal.

1:47:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry the integrity hub What would be the first things we should work on in your opinion?

1:47:42 - A L
  I think design the desktop version um to develop the Experience of selecting data Okay, um um, maybe design the mobile version, I guess, or the downloadable and then the downloadable the employee wrap.  that the high level version? Is that the summary version or the employee part of it? employee wrap?

1:48:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The employee wrap is the Gen Z beautiful individual personalized thing.

1:48:24 - A L
  Yeah then that I think can go later. I think what we need is like at least like you know immediately is something that works externally when they're working with us like you know we're working with fortify on these you know following things or something like that like I guess there's like I guess the question is when when do they want to use the bragging on this so I do they want to brag you know it takes nine to 12 weeks to get the ISO right to get all of these controls are working on it right but you could brag some of it in the meantime being like we're working on X amount of controls we're doing this and blah blah blah and then the ISO  But that lasts like, you know, sticker that they have, right? it's more like, and then maybe the words need to change from when they have the ISO certification or like they have, these are the controls that we have.  And then one of them are the ISOs. Well, we want them immediately to have a link already that they can start, you know, bragging about on what they do or working at different controls.  have employee training, you know? So maybe the dashboard and the ISO part isn't as good, you know, there, but you might be having a quote.  You might have some different things. You can be like, you know, we're working on these different things. Or like companies can be like, for us, for Sprinto, when we didn't actually even post it on our website and totally got the certification.  And then we post it on the website, right? So I think it depends on like, how we want to have people use it.  Like, is it wants to get the certification? Probably not because there might be some companies that don't want the certification.  So they just want to have proof that they're doing something. You know what I mean?

  Yes. So in that case, I would... Suggest that the mobile version is not right now. Yeah, that's fine. And I think this comes comes up first because if we select the wrong data it doesn't matter what we do is not interesting for customers.  Yeah. And it's probably this. Select which data points are relevant for customers. Design the desktop version, developing the experience, and then perhaps the downloadable reports.  Yeah. And actually, yeah. also needs to be here for sure. Okay. Okay. So, so we agree that first we need to get a working version.

1:50:53 - A L
  Simple working version.

1:51:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a better experience, more branded, I don't know, community push, something like this. Does this make sense to you?

1:51:30 - A L
  Yeah, I think that's fine. Got it.

1:51:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so yeah, I think it's going to be important we go through this stuff with the tech team, because there's a lot of, you know, developing aspects to it.  But yes, that's it. Yeah, when would you want to talk with Ivan?

1:52:00 - A L
  about it.

1:52:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I guess I could talk to him about this tomorrow. Could I just set up a chat with him and list him some questions?  Or you want to participate on that one?

1:52:23 - A L
  No, I Ivana Gorna, probably.

1:52:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, I think we are at the end of our time and also at the end of what we had planned for this.  Do you feel this? brought some clarity? Yeah, I think it's good.

1:53:05 - A L
  I think it kind of brought some clarity about the whole employee portal that we discussed last time, but we didn't talk about the employee wraps and the shareable nature of that.  So if that can be brought in, I don't know Romeo's on this call, but maybe you can mention it to Romeo.  So when he designs or I don't know if Mal's doing it, like when they designed that employee portal part to maybe have a part around the employee wraps built into that already.  It might be late because I think it's tomorrow and I'm just gonna talk to discuss the first part, right?

1:53:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the aspect of including employee wraps is that on the surface it's about maybe just creating a section on Figma, but there's the whole like what's the vibe, what are the things we're sharing.  I mean we can have like a parallel discussion about like drafting pen and paper, so it's like how it could work, but it feels like it's a bit of a nice work issue.  complex like just for this corporate thing which is not so interactive it took us like this whole time, right?

1:54:08 - A L
  Yeah, okay, I think I want to see how how we want to do that, but um, yeah, I think it's more important just to get this out So that works Okay, thank you.  All right.

1:54:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you so much for your time.

1:54:19 - A L
  All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye You
