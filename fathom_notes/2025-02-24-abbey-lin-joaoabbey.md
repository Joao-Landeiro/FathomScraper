0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello. Hi, how are you? Good, and you? Oh, all right, been better.

0:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  was telling Brighton. have pneumonia, so it's a last winter holiday. It was not very fun till last week. The whole family went down, but I'm on antibiotics.

0:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm a little better. Oh, okay, hope you get better quickly, and everybody else gets better quickly. So for today, I think our thing was asset management.  Yeah, it's any of the controls that are remaining, just to make sure that we have everything drawn out for controls.

0:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And ideally, we we have time to move more towards the other ones, too, towards the other things. That needs to be mapped out.

1:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'll share my screen. And the customers have been moving around the meetings.

1:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I see that in your calendars because I them all reminders this morning and then they all came back changing their meeting times.  So we don't have a lot of the feedback meetings are changed. Later this way.

1:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you see my screen? you do this?

1:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

1:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And so is the asset management that we're missing, right? So for the asset management, is it mostly about IT stuff or?

2:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it is mainly about IT stuff. And it's like, we can think about it in two ways. It's like, one, when you're a new employee, there should be a central place of like, I gave this mouse to Zhao and I gave this keyboard to Brighton.  Zhao has been assigned five to monitors and this, right? So, and then ideally you will track it. So when it's returned, like, you know, Zhao leaves the company, you kind of know where your devices are.  Oftentimes, I've seen in many companies, they're just sitting in a closet somewhere, right? And then, like, nobody knows who it belongs to.

2:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then, so one is just understanding for like theft and like value assets, right? But the other thing, the main reason is you want to know whether you want to keep track of whether or not you just  pose this improperly when the time comes, right?

3:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like that they're not just sitting in a, you're not just taking and dumping it, right? You, there's like some kind of evidence that you have taken it ideally to an organization that recycles it and gives it to people who don't have access to computers, they wipe it clean or that you've actually just used it into, you've thrown it out in an environmentally safe way.  That's kind of the main reason. So whether or not it is, it's like you send it like Zhao, you are the IT person.  So you have access to our tool and then our tool has the asset register that you as an IT manager can do it.  That's good. Another option if you wanna go, maybe they're the lazy rate or the decentralized way is like you make every employee in their portal fill out what they have so that they know which track of it is and it's in a central location but then you at least know what's assigned to you.  And that can be another option too if there is no IT, central IT manager which they're and not be, right?

4:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like in smaller companies.

4:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So it could just be like, hey, employees confirm, these are the ones that you're kind of responsible for, right?  And these have been assigned to you. And that usually doesn't exist in a company, right?

4:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it could be helpful, especially if you have an employee portal. Anyway, here's all your trainings.

4:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  These are the assets that have been assigned to you. You know, is it not working? Or is it working?  have you return them so you can check when you leave the company, you return them and sign them out or something like that?

4:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

4:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And the reason, so the reason why this is necessary for ESG purposes is mostly around e-waste?

4:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

4:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

4:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. what I'm thinking is, I suspect that

5:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  especially for large companies, they do have some way of tracking right things right because they have like these stickers with the barcodes and yeah they're like they're like you know Rolls Royce tools around asset management like the scanner this and do that a lot of companies smaller companies don't have it but yeah bigger companies will have it and even that they lose track of it because what I'm thinking is what's the least we can do for asset management because they're they're like entire companies just like what is the Toyota version of asset management right like and that is just like a list I think it's just like an electronic list that the IT guy writes in you know the employee name and that you know the the device and then the device number and then I think you're just I think we have an asset register too that like the that and that word document I don't know we could try to pull it up from the ISO

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we have it? me see if I can find it.

6:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I said register design.

6:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's an Excel file. Yeah.

6:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you see it? Did you find it?

6:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

6:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

6:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's, yeah. No, that's not it.

6:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

6:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You have it?

6:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I do.

6:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At least what I have is a message on Slack. Okay. That asset register in parentheses design dot Excel. Yeah.

6:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. And if I, yeah, can have the actual one.

6:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

6:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

6:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's like maybe seven cones. One, two, three, five, six, seven, eight cones. Yeah.

7:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And that could be like the, oh yeah, no, it's not started. Yeah. So asset ID, asset description, asset class, and then the owner, department responsible doesn't need this many, I think we don't need that many, but like, it's just like a very light version of this.  That's not on Excel file is probably the least of what we need to do.

7:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm thinking. Okay. Do we need, in order to fulfill the ESG?

7:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No. Hello.

7:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You waste.

7:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sorry, you cut out in order to fulfill what? So in order to fulfill our.

8:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ESG obligations? Do we need to track the entire end-to-end process or can we just drop in at the last stage and have something to do with how you manage e-waste?  What do you mean? So my assumption is that to have a system that tracks all the IT assets of course the end result is to have like a spreadsheet but the system is more than a is sending people things and reminders and checking if this computer has been used for the past four years and wipe it clean.  There's like a constellation of things around this right? So in order to keep things more practical given that this is not like the core feature of Fortify could we just design like the last the most important feature for the e-waste compliance?  So instead of tracking like the whole register new assets, attributing that asset to someone, tracking if that someone is using the asset, and so on.  Could we just focus on the last state, which is around e-waste? How many computers did you send to an e-waste recovery facility, something like that?  No, I know what you mean. But I think it might be two. I'm just thinking the audit trail.

9:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  if you were just to be like, OK, five, and just put that number in, an auditor will be like, where's this five coming from?  What are these five? You're going to still need an Excel spreadsheet that you need to go to. It's like, it was these five that went waste, and here's the proof of it.  So I think we need to at least have an Excel spreadsheet that they can at least point back to, that these are the five that we decided to go in.  They're not just going to take them. at that face value. So I think you could do like a very light version of it.

10:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It doesn't need to have A through M.

10:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it could be a much lighter asset register than even this Excel file here, like just being like name, you know, device and that.  I don't think it needs to be so much. We could ask ChatGPT what is the lightest version of this, you know, and then just use that.

10:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but I understand, but my point is not so much about the complexity of the spreadsheet, is like the whole environment around the spreadsheet, right?  The spreadsheet is like we're meant to be a tool and a workflow tool.

10:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And I think that not just the reporting tool, right? If you just do the five, then you're just the reporting tool, you're reporting those five numbers.  But like we're actually a management tool, which is this helps you manage it with is like having an Excel, even if it's basic like traction, like like right now, like, you know, in a lot of small companies, including ours, like, I don't know who has which computers and and and that like so even if we had like four to five  at one, then it's actually helpful for us for like a basic use of a management of these, you know, for formal things, both in terms of like understanding our assets, but like having things in a centralized location.  So I think we should have at least some kind of Excel or register that they work with at minimum.

11:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so do we know anything about, so we know about the the end result, which is the the trail, right?  The paper trail. Do we know anything about how people do this besides the artifact of the spreadsheet? people, this is like done by the facilities guys, right?  infrastructure. it's like an IT guy.

11:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  there's an IT central manager, it's usually this person's job. And if a smaller company doesn't, usually it's maybe an office manager or it's not really tracked.  that well, I would say in a small company. So we can be a tool for a small company that doesn't track it very well.  Okay, okay.

12:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's assume it begins with team management. Scenario 8. Scenario 8. So IT manager. Or like COO or like one person designated office manager.  They have computers and they give these computers to employees, right? Yeah. And they register this in a spreadsheet.

12:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then these employees, they use the computers and after some time,

13:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello?

13:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK.

13:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry.

13:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Did I freeze again? Yeah, froze.

13:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Shall we go to Google? Yeah, yeah. Opening a link. Okay, there we go.

13:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  All right, I'll go over there.

13:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

13:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

14:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. You
