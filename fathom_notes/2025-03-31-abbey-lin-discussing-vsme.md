0:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello.

0:06 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  How are you?

0:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, and you? Long time no see.

0:10 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Long time no see.

0:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you have a good, what's the holiday?

0:14 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Vacation? No, it wasn't really a holiday or vacation. I went to a big expo, and then I came back and I got very sick, and then I got well and then my dog died.

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hmm. Sorry to hear that.

0:31 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah. So it's just been a big stretch of a lot of stuff. But here we are and we're back again.  What about you?

0:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I traveled for carnivores in a while, right? Then I came back. I've been recording some episodes for my podcast and some client work.  I started a book which is are the most exciting parts of my week, I think, when I get to sit down and type it out.  Yeah, I think that's it.

1:09 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Cool. Those are all great things. How was the car involved?

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was good. mean, we didn't go to the bar to feast themselves. It's just like, because it's a big holiday in Brazil, it's a good time to travel.  And we went to the feast and we went to this really cute little tropical village. And it had deserted beaches.  some points, there was just me and my wife and no one else, which was a great feeling. And sometimes there's like a huge extension of sand and maybe three other people.  I usually joke that as a foreigner in Brazil as an European, this is the Brazil I was promised. that kind of thing.  And I also saw a spider this big. I hate spiders. And that was interesting. It was just standing still, I knew that there were spiders like this, but I never seen one with my own eyes, right?

2:17 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  it was, no, it's not a tarachula.

2:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No.

2:21 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Oh, it was.

2:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was, it was, Harry. Really, really big one. But it's funny because they're not poisonous, apparently. So the people that are used to them, they're like, oh, yeah, there's a spider.  like, yeah, I like them.

2:36 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  You know, I used to be terrified of spiders. tarachula are, you know, they're benign in the fact that they're, they're actually, I mean, they have no defense.

2:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you what I mean?

2:49 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  could, you can kill them fairly easily, but you know, they're, they're special because I could say they're not here.  attack humans, they're not like black widow spiders I can take about, know. And yeah, they can get we just have little tiny ones here.  But they can get quite big and eat birds and all this kind of stuff. But so my fear of spiders got changed.  When I learned, so Native American Indians, they believe that when animals show up in your life that way like a huge spider, it's because animals are on the path of healing and their messages that have been left for you on your path.  And so spiders, when a spider shows up, it means weave the web of your dreams. That's, that's where it shows up.  So obviously a big huge one showed up. it's like, hey, you're you got a lot in you. So you need to build a really good web.  yeah got it so yeah and two weeks later i started the book in a podcast so i guess i guess i guess wow thank you spider thank you yeah it really changed my perspective and then i i knew someone briefly and he actually was like a spider expert um but it was amazing because he you know there's we have quite a few different types of spiders around here and so different webs show up or whatever and he was able to say yeah this spider so they're incredible architects so some of them build their webs on the ground and they're very intricate they've got layers so that they catch different things at different times yeah yeah and others um you know like i say they'll do the the sort of what we know is the traditional spider web and i mean there's just such brilliance to what they do and so after that i couldn't really  the spider web because it's like oh my gosh the spider has just taken a day or two or five to build his whole creation and then just in one swipe I do away with it for what you know so um I actually leave them now like in our bedroom I have one window that I leave them in and it actually is really helpful because it catches the flies and things like that until it gets really nasty whatever and then like okay that's enough you have to build a new web this window here my my desk used to face it and there was a really cute little spider and he started building his web and you know he would run out and grab insects and eat them and stuff like that and I thought I have this relationship with the spider and then he grew bigger and and then he was kind of scary looking you know what I mean I was like okay I think and I never did it with him in the web you know I would knock on the wood so they would run away and then I would take his web away so he had to go build some place

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's that's interesting for some reason I'm much less Not just scared but like repulsed by snakes and I think the next are usually much more dangerous than spiders, but Like the other day Yeah, we saw Black Red white the coral is it the coral?

6:28 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, those are very Yeah, it was really beautiful.

6:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, but that was not scary to me, but I know they are really Poisonous Um, so for today, uh, I thought about I organized a little thing and can I share my screen?

6:46 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yes, please I think I think it's disabled that you might need to enable something on your side Snakes, just so you know are about Transformation I grew up in Africa.  So I know You about snakes. Okay. There you go.
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/fSgb95S-_jKcXpHEK-gBZkwYXP5U8LnJ?timestamp=429.883043

7:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, very quickly. On our email, email conversations, one of the things, and the last conversation we had, one of the things that you've expressed was, you were interested in positioning Christa Cavallo as a state of symbol, right?  And I think you've even used the Yeti example.

7:37 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah.

7:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is that still something you were interested in?

7:43 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  It was. I think it still is. I think it's still important for people to be able to see it as something.  You know, I'm still I'm still really I'm not going to say grovel, you know, I still need to crack the code on people still want to put us in leadership development.  If that's where they're going to continue to put us until we can build up the status of being strategic developers and executors, I feel like that will be important, you know, maybe that will be an important way to get to that bridge.

8:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I could be wrong. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Got it.

8:38 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And I asked you the story, which I had never read, and it's really interesting because how they did it is they were very clear to name the enemy and the enemy with cheap igloos, you know what I mean, cheap ice holders.  which is why they could all of a sudden be put a $400 price tag because the guy that started them basically said well you know tell me what's different about it and then to all the technical terms just like I do right and he said yeah well no that's not what I mean what else does this type of plastic which you say is so much superior to than this styrofoam aglu thing you know what else is this plastic used for and they said kayaks and he said well that's what you need to be talking about right so it's sort of like we need that type of analogy it's like this is not just used for leadership development this is used for you know and we need to to claim that you know this is this is used for superior decision-making right and that is what basically protects and grows your bottom line  So the enemy is, you know, not great decision-making or faulty decision-making or not well-developed decision-making. I guess I'd have to, you know, test that theory.

10:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I made some notes here. So let me just, I think we might need to change the, a little bit of the plan, but let me just give you a bit of an overview, right?  Okay. So we get parts of this are still usable and make sense still. So how can we position Vista Caballo in a different way?  And then he told me about something that was becoming a pattern, which is, you know, people get really excited at first.  And then when they take it to another, you know, buying committee or other people or their decision-makers, then the thing loses a little bit of steam.  And one of the things we explored was maybe we should interview these people. in a very short, very not trying to be defensive or like, please, because we try to figure out what happened, right?  A little bit of a post mortem of that process. With this in mind, we spoke about, okay, let's plan how we would run these kind of interviews or customer discovery motions.  And for that, I put together this quick session so that we could figure out what we're trying to learn from them, who we will ask, and later out to actually put these things in motion as like a plan.  Would this be useful for this session?

11:47 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, totally.

11:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. So let me send you the link to this. I'll put it on the Zoom. There's the Zoom. I spend most of my day on Google Meets, I don't use Zoom too much.  So the best for this, Vista, Vista, twice. Okay, I've got the mural for, thank you. Are you in?

12:24 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Almost. It's trying.

12:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, okay. No problem.

12:28 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  So it's Vista, Vista, is that the password?

12:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay. Okay, I see you here. I'll pull you to me. And now you are free to roam, if you lose me, just press on my face.  you'll follow my, follow my thing. So on that email we spoke about this like no strings attached thing which is let's spend a session this session to figure out the plan on how to talk to these people.  And then if you decide to talk to these people I can join in on some conversations or listen to the recordings whatever you prefer.  And then after that we have a final conversation just to extract the insight from those conversations. Okay and all of this is no strings attached it's it's good for me also to put in the wraps on this stuff.  And for today this is session one the idea is to create a little research plan which is basically an hypothesis that people won't figure out and a script for how to do this.  So today for today success looks like this we'll have a customer research plan and you can interrupt me at any time.  Yep and this is the way I was trying to I'm sure where we're going, right? So you'll read faster than I can read.  I just divided it in these three different layers.

14:35 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, and I think that I think, you know, what's come up is I really don't know who our target audience is.  I think, you know, what has come up for me is I know who I want our target audience to be, but I don't, I don't.  think that that's actually who our target audience is. So in other words, like traditional medicinals, okay? Well, I want them to be our target audience because they're a recognized brand.  As opposed to making ourselves the recognized brand, right? And because traditional medicinals doesn't have any money.

15:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like they have nobody.

15:28 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Do you know what I mean? So not really looking to grow or develop their people, not this year. They're going to a huge $15 million building or something like that.  So that's where I'm like, okay, wait a minute, maybe part of the problem is I'm not actually talking to the right people.  And the right people really are, at least where we've gotten traction is in companies that are growing, They're going from what they're very specific about, we're here and we want to be here.  I, I think I haven't really said that, you know, and it's really interesting because one of our other clients, um, that is what they were doing.  They were growing, but they said, no, no, we've got it all figured out. So I just started this scorecard thing and when they filled it out, well, what they don't have figured out is they don't have any bandwidth.  So all of a sudden I was like, wait a minute, that's another clue, right? It's like, you're growing, but you don't have any bandwidth.  Like, how is that going to work? So you've got the finances, but you don't have the, the time and I'm like, well, if you don't have the time or the bandwidth, how are you going to grow?  I think that's, I think that's really what my, my block is, is I do not know. I can't say to you, okay, Joe, you know what?  Our target audience are, you know, companies that are $160 million and up that, you know, are growing in some way.  And we talked with, you know, if they're at that level, you know, we talked with someone in the C-suite or the CEO.  And like we talked to a company and they are growing and they are interested and I talked to the CEO.  the next thing she said, okay, now I need to introduce you to my head of people. And I'm like, you know, so I think that's, I haven't, I think that's a big issue.  Anyway, I just want to put that out there.

17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I feel that's a combination, right? I think a lot of people, it's also a little bit organic. So we have our own intentions, but then the market changes a little bit.  We have to figure out who's actually, you know, finding our stuff and buying your stuff. So actually from other conversations, other people that's a thing that seems to come up relatively often the whole ICP definition is on the surface seems clear, but when people need to put a lot of energy behind one specific ICP definition and it's like, okay, are we going to spend a lot of money on ads, stuff like this?  And then people are like, oh, maybe we're not so sure. So yeah, I think that's a common pattern. I think especially in services, we really need to...  It's a trust-based business, so not having the right ICP, you feel it very quickly because people just don't buy it.  That's an interesting direction to explore. And I'll leave this here as a bit of a parking lot, maybe we could use this time.  And for this to explore, what's the one question we want to answer from this research? And what can you, what do you think are some, some possibilities?

19:12 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  You can filter them later about the questions we'd like to answer. I think the question that I would like to answer is, who is our target audience?  Is our, specifically, who is our target audience? What is their specific pain point? What do we need them to know about us that addresses that pain point?  And what do we need to know about them to get a yes?

19:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. These are great questions. Okay, let's stress is a little bit more. I really like these ones. I'm just trying to not go with the first thing that comes up.

20:23 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  What is the problem we solve in the marketplace? I'd say that maybe there's two marketplaces, one is strategy and one is leadership.  Since we want to go into strategy, but people keep still saying that we're in leadership. What the unspoken fear in the future of our target audience?

21:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We don't need to fill all of them if you don't want to.

21:30 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Is anything else coming up for you?

21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Honestly, perhaps I think it's related to this one, but something around what sets us apart in terms of in the eyes of the people that have, you know, interacted with us, hired our services.  What did they retain about Vistaca value that Kavayo, that was like, okay, this is different and they are on a league of their own.  I think that's always a very rich data point, like how others describe what we do, what kind of things they complement and so on.

22:40 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And maybe the question is, how do we get people to see us as strategic and essential

23:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's try to position this on a two by two, know, consult and solve two by two matrices. So we need them.  So let me explain a little bit of what we're looking at. Some of these questions are more aligned to be subjectives and others are sometimes more like a curiosity just something we'll like to know but it's not immediately relevant.  And some of these questions are easy for us to answer because we can find the people that will give us the answer and some others are really more difficult.  Right. So let's try to position them. And none of these is like extremely scientific, but it's good. compare these things.  So starting with the first one, who's our specific target audience? Where would you position this?

24:20 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Or if you want you can just grab it in. I'd say where it is, is pretty good, yeah.

24:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nice. So what's your specific pain point, this one? Where would we put it?

24:35 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I'd also say, I put it in that same box.

24:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Here in this quadrant?

24:46 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah.

24:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. What do we need to know, what do we need them to know about us that addresses that pain point?

24:56 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Um, What do we need to know them to know about us that addresses that pain point? I also put it in that same box.

25:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It makes sense, right? It's related to the previous one. What do we need to know about them to get a yes?

25:30 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I maybe put that in, maybe in the upper left.

25:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

25:39 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Here?

25:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what's the problem that we solve in the marketplace? And maybe there are two marketplaces, strategy or the leadership development.

25:52 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And maybe I'd maybe choose our specific target audience to that same box about, yeah.

26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is one here? okay.

26:03 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And then what is their problem of in the marketplace? Hmm. Okay.

26:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Say in the upper right Okay, I Realize this question. What's the unspoken fear in the future of a target audience?

26:47 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I guess you you could put it in that same box.

26:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Okay Okay, so looking looking at the best what missions that we created in our best clients that they love.

27:06 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, I put that in the same box.

27:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And finally, how do we get people to see us as strategic and essential?

27:23 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Well, I put that in the attention. guess I put it to the left, but I think, again, my perception is, you know, how many clients do I have and is that who are answering or is this something that we're going put out on LinkedIn, you know, answer it or, or, or, or, you know what I mean?  Yeah. I think the ones in the left box are because I don't know, you know, how, how much can we tap my current store, you know, and do we need to be talking to people outside of my clients and then have

28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we get access to them. I think there's ways, but I understand, I understand the logic behind it.

28:11 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  So if that's the case, then I would put that one in the left, if there are ways, and then I put the unspoken fear in the same box.  I mean, if we're going outside of my current clients, then I would put, what is there specific pain point in the left?  And I put, yep, that one in the left.

28:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This one?

28:46 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yep. And then I put, what do we need them to know about us that are going to put that in the left?  Because if I'm going to a new audience, that's going to be my biggest thing. How do I get access?  to them, how do I get them to talk to us?

29:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Before we move on, did this trigger specific reflections or ideas or insights that?

29:20 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, again, I think my, my, it sort of is the same, you know, insight that I had before is like, I think I have limited myself wanting to be associated with a certain target audience, right, with the sustainable target audience, as opposed to maybe just qualifying who is our specific target audience, not the industry, and then letting those transformations help us own the  history, right? So in other words with Yeti, so it's interesting if we were to do a parallel. So Yeti just went into the outdoor world specifically hunting and like deep-sea fishing because with both of those you have to be able to keep meat cool or fish cool long periods of that's where they started.  Now household name. They didn't start by saying we want to be a household name. They just said we want to go from, you know, we want to own the cooler business at a really high price.  We want to know that there's a different experience of coolers and maybe that's what I'm saying here too. It's like maybe it's like maybe the strategy should be let's just let people know that there is a different  different type of development experience that is, you know, is about, you know, it is about development. It's about using, you know, your people's intelligence in a different way to execute your strategy type thing.  And, and then we get to direct it into the marketplace that we want to go into. Like we're, you know, I think that's maybe being sort of fighting an uphill battle there, right?  Getting known, like where everybody's like, Oh, you know, you mean you haven't used, we use the still point, I will use the still point, we use the still point, you know what I mean?  And so I needed some big brand names like Ben and Jerry's to get people's attention. But instead of staying in that market, you know, maybe it is going to, like I say, different industries, super cool, like before  api got bought by Pepsi, they would have been a great brand to have.

32:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  know what I mean?

32:05 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Maybe Rudy's gluten-free bread, maybe Justin's before it got bought. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, anyway, you hear what I'm saying, right?

32:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes. So there's a few things I'm thinking. So the first one is, I think the Yeti story is really good because they started with people for whom quality was really, really important.  I mean, there's no point in going to Pepsi fishing and then all the fish you catch, I know, ruts out before you can get home because the cooler you use is crap, right?  And the same thing with hunting. It's also expensive hunting, right? I think I've heard all the time you put in, all the gear licenses and so on.  So it feels that they started with people that had a very pressing pain points, and they were willing to pay more to address that pain point, right?  And then you build a following around those discerning segments, which will influence the other ones, right? People get influenced by the pros.  And I think this idea of using some sort of beach head that we can really own, and use that to moving to other agents and adjacent segments could be really interesting.  Now, I gotta say, I'm not an expert at that. mean, we can have this sort of discussions. I feel that I can be useful as kind of a, let's say, mental sparring partner, but I'm not especially used to that position.  tuning or ICP definition or stuff like that, much more around the productization angle on how to transform expertise into a product or into a workshop format or something like that.

34:13 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, that's okay. Because even this, I think that we're getting there because if we looked at the Yeti comparison, so yes, they had a pain point to your point, they spent a lot of money already.  Okay, well, the pain point for corporations is they too invested in these people, right? And these people are out of bandwidth.  They're out of bandwidth, right? Especially now, companies don't want to spend more money on hiring more people. They just want the people that they have to be able to handle all the work.  And that is a very specific pain point at every level of growth. Every time a company grows,

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that stretch point right because they want to sort of prove that the growth is really there and sustainable and it's still going to grow and so there's always this stretch point for their people so that would be a very interesting specific targeted approach yes yes um so the other day I was helping someone else that is is from marketing so he is more uh he would he that person would not identify themselves as a icp expert but you know more about the icp than I do and he was telling me about this very interesting idea of the ibp right so you have the icp and then you have the ideal buyer profile which is a role inside of the icp right and you can have different ibp's so as an example let's say that your icp is um  You know, big corp certified companies that are at the new flexion point where they're about to enter different playing field and they need to level up their team, let's say.  And then we would have some other characteristics. And then perhaps the IVP of those companies could be maybe the investors of those companies.  Right. That's a person that would be championing the decision of using your services because they see the point. In this example, this is just an illustration.  The kind of things you would say, kind of materials you distribute, the kind of conversations you'd have aimed at those decision makers, the buyer profile, would be different for, let's say, an investor in a big corp, like an activist investor, or  HR leader that, you know, is also experienced on the segment as another set of worries. So basically the idea that I found really interesting, there's two points.  The first one is that the ICP, it's kind of the company, right? And then the IVPs are the person that makes a decision in the company.  I thought this was an interesting idea. And the other thing that he told me about that I found also very intriguing is signals that from the outside we can read that point towards already they are for making a decision.  a very obvious example is companies that just got funding and they've announced that they got funding. This is a very easy to read from the outside signal, right?  But there are other signals, like you saw something in the news about a new CMO joined that company, you know, new C11.  Usually they have that special moment where they need to deliver results really quickly and they are under pressure for that.  You know, things like that. So I think not the signals themselves are relevant, but the idea that we can try to answer this with which signals are readable from the outside.

38:25 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And again, you know, it's interesting because Matt did our positioning. And so what he said is, you know, we were the only company that, you know, can amplify a visionary leader's, you know, their vision basically by equipping their teams to be liberated from the fear of failure, right?  So he calls it like Dauntless teams.

38:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool name.

39:00 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  then I think you know going with this it's like and we get them there by being able to change the bandwidth on demand you know and so now all the mechanics start now it starts to differentiate itself pretty well right um and again I think it's because you just simplified it by saying okay so they're companies that are at an inflection point and need to up level their teams that's pretty simple right and that's pretty accurate yeah I think thank you I think that oftentimes that's the case especially for this kind of services I think that's rare that the company makes a decision like this that they don't have to do sometimes it's like I really excited they're interested careers leader that just

40:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to do it. But human nature dictates that we usually attend to things when things are getting a little bit more urgent.  So I think that's a common kind of pattern. And so the question then would come like what are the inflection points at which it makes sense for us to join, right?  And one of the things that I think is perhaps complex, but everything is a bet. think this is really helpful, is depending on which companies do we want to serve, some inflection points are more common.  And it could also be the other way around. are we focusing on a certain kind of company? And then we learn about that type of company and we find the inflection points?  Or are we more about figuring out the inflection points at which we are very useful? and then find companies that are at those inflection points.  There's two different directions, which I think is akin to vertical positioning and horizontal positioning. But that's an interesting reflection to have and an important decision to make at some point.  So I'm going to think out of, based on this, on these things, a lot of things started on one side and then went to the other side.  And the reason that I registered when you were shifting them from one side to the other was this, how do I get access to these people that are not right now in my target market, right?  And I think this is a very common question. I mean, I've had to answer this for myself as well, it's a little bit of...  I mean, there are shortcuts, I think you probably have a very good network. And if you talk to people and say, I'm working for companies like this, you might get a couple of intros.  But there's also the other way, it's LinkedIn sales navigator, that kind of more outreach-y sort of thing. One thing that becomes more obvious when we start to discuss this, what things I want to find out, is that we begin to think in terms of experiences, experiments, right?  We try to figure out how do I learn the thing I need to learn, right? What kind of motions I need to make to figure out the answer for this thing that's important to me to know.  And a lot of these things, I would say, most of them, perhaps, let's try to check. But some of them are more like an internal decision.  For instance, this is more an internal decision, I would say. Yeah, this seems to be more an, an internal decision, but then there's a, there's the sister question to this one, which is, who actually is buying our services right now, right?  It's not a decision, but it's a fact based on history, which would be related to this is what the question, right?  What transformations have we created in best clients? everything that's related to best clients is easy to check because we have access to them, right?  And I think that's an interesting direction to begin because it can teach us a lot of stuff very quickly.  You can remove a lot of uncertainty very quickly. So do you want to try to get some current hypothesis on this, like some guesses on this answers?

43:57 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, because again, Joe, it's like

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  am I saying your name right? Yeah, yeah.

44:04 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  It's so interesting because I was on another Zoom call and the guy's name was Joe and he was from Portugal.

44:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm like, it's a very common name.

44:14 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Anyway, I was all excited because they said it a lot so I was like okay practice. So as you're saying this, again, I think I have made this more complicated and you are simplifying it, which I really appreciate because where are greatest successes have been?  I look there, to answer that question about where are case studies, they are that companies have been funded and are going to their next level.  That's happened several times with great success and all So new hires to a company. So the chief growth officer, the chief innovation officer, the CEO, those are the ones that have brought us in.  And so like this one client, she was at a company that brought us in when they had, you know, when they were moving from founder based to funded based.  And then now she's moved to another company. And so they are already funded, but they need to lead and she wants to bring this in to basically get immediate traction.

45:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. I don't know if this is an expression of yours.

45:51 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  really like the founder based to fund it based. That just popped out.

45:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like it too. Yeah, it's really good. Um, because. immediately it talks about at least two different things which is like the leveling up and the changing on how decisions get made and what kind of you know oversight there will be when you're founder you can just do things and have your mojo.  So okay and so this thing we have described is not really the transformations but this is a good direction right and the best way of answering this would be to engage with these people and talk about them talk to them always in a more exploratory like not try to confirm to confirm things or to you know sell services like really tell me more about what changed but let's try to get the hypothesis on that what what do you think that changed like specifically

47:00 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Um, I think that, uh, the, the teams, uh, that they were able to, you know, get focus and click and cohesion.  Um, I think that, um, Um, I think they're able to define for themselves what, uh, what high performing is for them and then to achieve that.  Um, one client said that, There are no longer victims of circumstance. They're now firmly in control of their own destiny, right?  So other words, they get to take the reins instead of just being buffeted around. One client has said repeatedly, this is a way that we become better humans and when we become better humans more developed in our, you know, as people, as a person, then we become better leaders.  I mean, maybe instead of a teams being able to define high performing for themselves. I mean, because other people say, you know, will we help people become high performing?  I we can discuss the language.

49:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  different moment but that's an interesting transformation that it's useful to keep in mind.

49:10 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  So you know the other thing that they that I've heard is we used to be a group of people working together.  Maybe this is what I'm trying to get to with the high performing. We used to be a group of people working together and now we are actually you know a bonded cohesive high performing team okay got it got it.

49:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a very good transformation as well because I think it's it's detailed enough and at the same time does not rely on jargon or anything for people to understand like yes I've worked with others my entire life but there's a few moments that's and often we don't  realize that at the moment, but like, oh, this will be like a top 10 project in my life, because I love these people and I love what we're doing, right?

50:10 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  one of the other things that came up was that this is a way to produce sustainable, scalable results with ease.  So that kind of fits into the, to the team thing. Because once you're you know, get to these results faster and scale them faster with greater ease, you know?

50:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm. There's an aspect of what you've described to me around your method. I don't know, maybe I will assume and then you'll correct me.  So your method, it, you know, actually considers neuroplasticity. It takes a little bit of time. And I feel that, symbolically, that's really powerful because it signals a couple of different things.  It signals like a commitment to the transformation. But it also creates, think, this is an hypothesis, it's interesting to explore these with people.  But I think it creates the space for these connections to emerge, right? So, like, a bad example, like an extremely bad example is opposite example.  It's like, oh, we'll just get together for a weekend and somebody will put, we'll go to some, you know, villa somewhere, and we're all 35 and everybody will get drunk and that's our off-site team building off-site.  That's crap. Yeah. On the other hand, you have this, like, more aware, involved. And the base, I think the base is the product, know, maybe, because the base creates the actual, probably I would guess that some people, you know, getting to it really quickly, some others take a little bit longer to warm up, and eventually they all get there, but they don't get there at the same speed, I would assume.  And that's also the differentiation, because you've stated this a few times, it needs to take this much time, and it matters, because it's about the method and the results.  It's not just about, you know, selling you a quick thing. So I feel that I feel that there's something there.

52:41 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, I like it, I like it.

52:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And maybe we can use that to try to think about what's a specific pain point for clients that you've served in the past.

53:06 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I think the pain point is they've tried, this is what I've heard, they've tried other things and they haven't worked and now things have literally sort of ground to a halt and they don't know what else to do.

53:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So by definition this also selects for a more, what's the name? I don't know, conscious kind of buyer, People that they have tried something  They're not satisfied and they still need to solve their problem. So maybe they have scars. They are kind of scarred from the leadership development world.

54:12 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah. Yeah, kind of. They kind of are.

54:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They are. I know that you want to address the strategic things so. So. So, so now let's let's think about not looking at the best, but perhaps looking at the idealized future.  What do you think it is like as a hunch as an hypothesis?

54:54 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Well, I can tell you the people that I love working with. I'm saying they. They are extremely decisive, they see it, they get it, they understand it in two seconds.  They do have a specific pain point to solve and they are totally willing and prepared and believe in the fact that their people can solve the problem.  They just have to figure out how to get them there.

55:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, but these in terms of like the person, right? Yeah. Okay.

55:50 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  You know, they're found in companies that are different, right? So I'll tell you like one of our clients. They created a new way to brew hawks, so alcoholic, they brewed it like a tea and then they added flavors in, but they put it in a can with carbonation, so it was like a fizz of beer, but it was a very different taste, like they made it from the tips of spruce trees and stuff like that.  So it's really refreshing. So and then another client, know, they're they're really making like completely 100% natural frozen food.  You know, I mean, it's food, but it's flash frozen, so it's not frozen food. You know what I mean?  It's different. So that when you cook it, it tastes really fresh. Another client, they have figured out a way to do like to clean commercial building sites.  in an eco-friendly way, so each one of them is, I would say very, you know, these companies are innovative and I think that's what draws these type of leaders to these type of companies.  Do you know what I mean? They're, they are themselves always looking for different ways to do things and that's why when they come across our tool they're not going, wait, what, how does this fit into the regular leadership?  They're not, that's not how they think. They're just like, you know, we're breaking new ground, we're creating this innovation, that is what we do, that is what this company does, and I need something to support our people in that.

57:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The picture I'm putting together in my mind, So you help me correct it if it's wrong, but the picture I'm putting together in my mind, it's something along the lines of they're very independent, but they see themselves as connected to the world.  They depend in the sense that they do things their own way, but they are part of this whole thing, right?  Not as in private equity, just building strip modes. Okay. Okay. So this is the idealized, right? You interact with some of these clients, but ideally you would like to work with more of these clients.

58:58 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah.

58:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And initially in our conversation today, you've mentioned something around, oh, maybe perhaps the sustainability market is a difficult market.  But the way you've described them right now, I wouldn't place them so much on the sustainability thing. To me, so, okay, personally, just as a sounding board.  When I think about sustainability, often the idea that comes to me is the degrowth kind of vibe. Let's do less things, spend less, and so on, right?  Kind of playing defense. But the kind of things you describe here, to me, they allude more to the playing offense.

59:41 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Like we need to fix the environment.

59:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We will never be able to just retract into a hole and hope things get better.

59:50 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  We need to get active on this.

59:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think that's very different from what I had in mind when I thought about the environment because it's less active, right?  Um, okay. Um, and what do you think?

1:00:07 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  No, it's also on other things, though, you know, really. To me, if we're talking about idealized. Part of what I want to idealize is that.  The work is continual. in other words, like with Ben and Jerry's, we just kept working with them because it would work over here and it would work over here and it would work over here and it would work over here and then the whole company had to shift forward and then we would start the work sort of again on a different level.  Do you know what I mean? So it's companies that will continue to grow from it and then cascade the work, make this like part of their DNA.  That to me would be ideal. And the other wanted to work, you know, in partnership with a company, whether it's a media company.  You know, something like that where they have a continual flow of our ideal client base and we are in partnership with them.

1:01:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so when you say that the picture that comes to me to me is. I don't know, maybe there's a magazine or a group or I mean there are for sure interest groups around this kind of conscious entrepreneurship.  Not just playing defense, like let's, know, the guys that break the boat to clean up the great plastic patch specific.  That's, that's like hardcore. They're serious about it right. This is the kind of thing that. And these people, they go to conferences, they.  have you know perhaps the same sort of lawyers or accountants because maybe they have specialized accountants that can help them with government benefits and stuff like that and grants and things like that.  So I would assume that they are not really competitors, which is a good thing. I was listening to a podcast on when is it a good thing that your clients speak to each other and this was exactly the kind of situation like they are in the same kind of group.  They're not competitors so they'll share freely like oh I did this thing with Lisa, was really good. You guys should do it you know so that was interesting.  Okay so a connection to some media or some aggregator that can provide you with a lot of leads and interest.  Okay Oh

1:03:03 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  And in a way, you know, we need a way, we need to give them some, put something in their hand so they can actually do that.  You know, send the client something and say, look, we just did this with her. You know, here's who she is.  You know, it's interesting because they don't want to send the website. They want something worse to sync. I've made them something worse to sync.  I don't think it's still maybe the right thing.

1:03:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. Okay. Let's let's put the pin on that one, like something to send them. And what do you think they need to know?  Sorry. What do we need to know about them to get a yes from them?

1:03:56 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Right. Right.

1:04:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  hypothesis, right? We can use the research to validate this, but like, what's your hunch on this?

1:04:12 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  We need to know that, let's see, and this is our idealized client, right? Okay. Okay. We need to know sort of what their unspoken fear is, again, like where they really want to go, but what they don't really want to say out loud because maybe they're not sure they can get there or that the team can get there.

1:04:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

1:05:00 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  We need to have sort of an understanding of their financials. In other words, know, some of these companies are $120 million companies and you say that something's going to be $30,000 and they flip out.  You know, that's like 0.006% of their income. So, you know, we need to know are they healthy financially and have they had the experience of what a great investment in their team can garner them financially?  You know, I need to know what keeps them up at might. I need to know who all the decision makers are, like before we even start talking.

1:06:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And who's the ultimate decision maker? There's a whole set of questions around buying committees that the person has a final say.  I think one aspect that we've mentioned at different points was what do they compare us to? Yes. So in which kind of bucket do they think we would fit?

1:06:50 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Right. And why are we in this conversation? Right. What bucket, what lens are they looking at us through? What problem do they think we can solve for them?

1:07:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is a whole constellation of things. But most of it, if you notice, they're mostly related to their attitudes towards this sort of thing like fears, experience level, what keeps them up at night kind of fears.  What are the decision makers and implied in this is how these decision makers think about this stuff. Who is the ultimate decision maker?  Which kind of bucket they put this in also relates to their attitudes towards this and what kind of problem they think we can  so for them. So a lot of it is perception, right? What's the perception? What's the mental model they have of this?  once we have that mental model, or at least a bit more clarity on that mental model, we can try to find ways that, you know, fit with the mental model.  So they're easy to accept, but change that perception a little bit. And that's like on a personal level, that's that's a thing that's been kind of difficult for me, because sometimes people see it what I do just as workshops, but it's not really like the HR team work, everybody hugs kind of workshops, and need to work to see in which bucket do they put me in and how I could, you know, change that perception.  right. So that's that's a subtle thing, but really, there's a lot of leverage there. Okay. So there's things they need to know about it.  about what we do that address their pain points. Which things they need to know about us that address their pain points.  Thank you

1:10:27 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Oh, are waiting for me to answer that?

1:10:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

1:10:30 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry about that.

1:10:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No problem.

1:10:42 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  That we are the solution to their problem. Well, that thing came for that we are You know, we're the sure thing, we're the thing that they couldn't find.  If the pain point is getting their teams to the next level that, you know, this is something that they can trust and rely on to do that.

1:11:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But why can they trust and rely, what makes it in our work that, like, assume that I'm very skeptical, right?  And you need to make a case for, like, this is different, right? And maybe they've come at this, we didn't know some questions have been through other programs, they're fully satisfied.  Which things that we have internally already, they're not new things, not things we need to develop. of that address, those pain points?

1:12:05 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Well, if they haven't been satisfied and where they've been, I guess I would need to clarify, well, where actually do they want to get to?  are they ready to get there? And what happens when they get there? So I would say it is our, like, what, what, what would you call what you are doing with me right now?

1:12:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This thing?

1:12:37 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah.

1:12:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I always struggle to define it, but I think I'm, you know, thinking this thing through with you, like shoulder to shoulder, we're figuring this thing out.

1:12:50 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah. So I would say that, you know, we are proven, you know, and that were science-based, and gosh, you know, we've been here for two decades, and we've worked with, you know, thousands of people and companies, all very successful, and we will help clarify what didn't work to make sure that it does work, and that we guarantee our work.  In other words, if, you know, we stay with you until you get what you came for.

1:13:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so that's a guarantee.

1:13:54 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  That's an actual guarantee on the contract. No, we, you know, we have a caveat in other words, after, you know, well, you have to do the work and you have to do the work and it has to be realistic.  And if all of these points have been met, we'll give you, you know, an extra month, you know, to, to get to where you need to get to, but you need to show up for that month and, you know, be engaged in all that kind of stuff.

1:14:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. So for me, the thing that, so this is an assumption on my side, but I would guess that, you know, leadership developments still need to talk about the strategy aspect, but okay.  So the previous experience that some of your clients might have had on improving the performance of their teams and so on.  I would assume that the reasons for their dissatisfaction on, you know, user services, I would assume that they're related to stuff like not very clear what they got out of it, formal like interactions, just checklists and stuff like that, and low context stuff, right?  So that's what I assume that would lead to bad experiences in in leadership development.

1:15:26 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I'm going to read you something, okay, because I think we get compared a lot to coaching.

1:15:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, I've mentioned that.

1:15:38 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Right. And so, let me see.

1:15:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me too stop sharing. No, no, that's okay. Oh, sorry.

1:15:55 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  So this is what I wrote for a potential client. I said, I'm going to give you more of a sense and feel for the still point experience.
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/fSgb95S-_jKcXpHEK-gBZkwYXP5U8LnJ?timestamp=4560.219478  Now, I didn't say versus coaching, but what I said is the time commitment is three, three and a half, four hours, every sprint, every 21 days.  The mechanism of change is neurobiological. It disrupts automatic patterns and activates clarity. It's science-based, vetted and validated, and it works on demand.  The focus is internal alignment, decision clarity, unlocking dauntlessness, which is the relentless pursuit of what others think is impossible.  Continuous improvement to get ahead of your own curve or the company curve. The depth of impact is immediate and in perpetuity.  The success metrics are measured by immediate shift in clarity, decision-making, confidence, challenges solved in three weeks. Prince, the ROI is bigger, better, bolder decision making and high stakes moments on demand, liberating leaders and their teams from fear of failure.  The still point dissolves the interference that created the problems in the first place.

1:17:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is internal, right?

1:17:19 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  We wrote this. Yeah.

1:17:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:17:22 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah. So to me, it's like she's very skeptical, very interested, but very skeptical, doesn't want to spend the money, but is in a really tough spot, right?  I know that this will do it for her. And so that's what I said to her. And I got a response back going, okay, you know, you've got my wheels spinning, you know, let's meet and talk about it, whatever.  So I'd say that, you know, if you were skeptical, that's probably if I had to say it in one sentence, it dissolves the interference that created the problems.  first place.

1:18:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this might depend a little bit on personality traits. I lean hard on the skeptical, right? a point that's annoying even to myself.  I don't know what's my enneagram or Myers-Briggs, yeah. So what I think is when I hear this, what caught my attention was the sprints.  When you mentioned the 21-day sprints. But maybe I'm not the target, right? But just sharing with you what caught my attention.  Why? Because it was a very specific thing that is provable. it made me think, why 21? And then there's 21 days to create a new habit, kind of popular culture right now.  So I like, oh, okay. I could see because it's an odd number. It's like pricing things that end in seven.  So it invites curiosity. And the way it works in terms of like it dissolves the block, I understand this conceptually.  As a very skeptical person, I'm like, yes, but what's the mechanism for dissolving the block? That's where I go.  And so maybe, yeah, I don't know. It depends on your target, for sure. Yeah, yeah.

1:19:37 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  It depends on your target. OK, well, tell you why you have my attention here. Although most of them are very decisive, they're usually very data-driven, very objective.  They want to win, right? So they don't really suck down in the emotional stuff at all. So that's why if you are convinced  Since chances are they would be convinced, you know, if I could say to you something that, you know, got your attention.  Okay, that's different. know, chances is it would be for them to I'd rather play to the skeptics because then the others are easy.

1:20:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So, okay, so those things got my attention. And also, when you've used the expression like ROI and so on.  I was primed to hear a number. And then what came was not the number was a description of where the ROI is, right?  And I think it's very difficult to really, you know, get hard data on this sort of ROI, is Come again.  Yeah, okay. So, so that's, that's a good thing to maybe just pick one or two big numbers and Well, I don't want to get too much into the  Advice giving because I don't think I'm qualified for that at this stage, but I think that would would speak to me like we improve the results in, I don't know, 2.4% and it's like, okay, tell me more about that white 2.4%.  No, um, but anyway, this is a very much like my own single perspective. Should we shift into the unspoken fear?

1:21:24 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Sure.

1:21:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You

1:22:00 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  you sorry and I just have to you know I've got like 10 minutes left okay yeah I've got excited about this and I think I lost a little bit of stuff so the unspoken fear I think is that they're not gonna make it and as a sea level they'll be booted something like that yeah that well that they're not gonna be able to get the team where it needs to be gotten to in the time frame that it needs to be gotten to because you know variable
  SCREEN SHARING: João started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/fSgb95S-_jKcXpHEK-gBZkwYXP5U8LnJ?timestamp=4963.997262  change so quickly. But I'd say that that is, yeah, that's always probably a driving force, right? And that they might have to let the team go, change the team.  I mean, they'll do it, but they don't want to.

1:23:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I think just zoom out for a second here. Theoretically, we're not at the stage where we could make a script.  Before we, you know, go deeper on one of these green post-its. Would it be useful for you to aim at creating a research plan, or this kind of discussion we're having right now, even without the user research, is useful?  Because we can spend more time on this and not to the research thing. If this is useful for you, I think it's useful because I think this then leads to the research piece, right?

1:24:34 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Or it's a different conversation. you know what I mean? Already I'm thinking about who we would want to talk to.

1:24:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you know what I mean? Yeah, absolutely. This leads to the research conversation. It's just about time. If we don't have enough time, because in 10 minutes we cannot really create a script.  But knowing these things, we can use these things to inform the script. Oh maybe this will be useful.

1:25:02 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I agree.

1:25:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's just set a timer for maybe five minutes and then use this five minutes to work on this and then five minutes to just recap and just not leave it in a rush.  I've been experimenting with this kind of thing. Okay so how do we get people, this is a big one, how do we get people to see as strategic and essential?

1:25:29 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I think we have to educate them.

1:25:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, what would we educate them on?

1:25:37 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  I think we would educate them on the fact that there is another alternative that they're unaware of that can help them meet their goals and something that they can, you know,  trust to do that, and I think as far as being essential, I think we have to tie it to their bottom line, which is this is a way that you guard and grow your bottom line.  You know, I think if I, you know, how do you get people to see anything?

1:26:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, they have to see that the proof is in the pudding.

1:26:49 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah. How did they see it with Yeti? They literally saw it. They would sit on it, they would open it, they would feel it, you know.  So how do we do that? you know, with our stuff, I think it's by seeing the results in other companies, you know, which is done through case studies and stuff like that, it's, I think really how we get them to do is we get them to actually do it, you know, so if this leads to a workshop or whatever, we get them to experience the impact of thinking through a different lens.

1:27:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. When we first started talking, I did check like everything on the website, but I gotta say, I haven't done it recently.  Do you have different case studies on it?

1:27:49 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1:28:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was wondering if there's someone that gets called in to solve a different problem, but that's a problem. So I'll give an illustration.  Let's say that there are accountants that come in and prepare a company for being ready. It's probably not an accountant.  probably something more complex than that. And in that process, they realize that there's other things a little bit more subtle that are not up to par.  Could we get maybe a network of partners that would introduce the idea of your work? Because in that sense, it's, there's some vouching on that, right, like someone, which is like, it's what happened between you, Matt, and me.  So I've never worked with Matt, which Matt online, we spoke, we never worked together. And it was enough for him to say, you know what?  kind of actively, been looking after, you know, people like Matt that are professional services marketers, I've been introducing myself to them.  And this has been kind of working. They see me as doing something different than what they do, but related.

1:29:41 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah.

1:29:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I was wondering if there's someone that, you know, occupies this space for you.

1:29:47 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Strategic partner.

1:29:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. At those inflection points, right?

1:29:57 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Okay. So now I have two minutes left. So, what shall we do from here? This is very helpful. I think it's really important.  I don't want to rush it. I want to shove through the last bit. What do you need for us to continue to work together?  Because I do think it's helping define and shape and come to some place for people to qualify us.

1:30:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, one of the things we could do is we replace one of the sessions where I just observe and for another session like this.  So, I observe one session instead of two. And we could do it that way. And we finish this in the next conversation, maybe next week.  And you leave with a script. Yeah. And yeah, my suggestion is just, do you have like this Fathom note takers kind of thing?

1:31:00 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  Yeah, but I didn't turn it on.

1:31:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, but you have them and you can turn them on if you need to, right? OK, so it would be useful to use that on one of the first conversations.  And then, yeah, so that's my proposal. It's me, I'll join one conversation instead of two. And we use that to finish this in terms of the script for another meeting.

1:31:26 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  OK, and I know you had like a range. So can you just resend that to me with something more exact?

1:31:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, do you want like an official proposal for after this? Yeah. OK, thank you. We'll do.

1:31:40 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  OK.

1:31:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you.

1:31:43 - Vista Caballo (Ca-buy-yo)
  All right, thanks, Joe.

1:31:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have a nice one. Bye.
