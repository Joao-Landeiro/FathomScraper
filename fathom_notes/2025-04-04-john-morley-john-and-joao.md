0:02 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Can you hear me I can I think I had it turned off the sound thank you for your patience little thing about Silicon Valley is our networks are crap here really bad oh yeah it's uh why is that well I mean I can't can I moan for a moment yeah for sure uh welcome to the United States where nobody invests in anything except corporate wealth okay heard about it as a european this country is just if I don't know where it's going I do not know where it's going and especially especially this week what the heck but yes we have no we have no investment in anything that might actually bring some social benefit not my rant over do you want to talk about uh trains or

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  burning power lines or well I mean power lines one is is crazy I mean and you know I'm I'm from Ireland so well twice Ireland and Portugal probably around the same right my brother in law works for the electricity company in Ireland and when he comes here he just does this he said this is so anyway yes you know something that's funny sorry do you want to but so I am Portuguese I live in Brazil Brazil is also kind of a new world country and there's I don't know there's for some reason I don't go out looking for this but like these chats like meeting people online that want to talk about like weird stuff almost always from Europe and a lot of people from  the the UK or the IELTS region. Like on my calendar, I know you're not from the UK but just from that region.  So I think that region is the most represented. For some reason, I don't know exactly what because I don't look for it.  It just happens. And I, well, I don't know what it is but I do suspect that there's a certain perspective around the value of ideas or the ones or something like that.  don't know. Let me just close my door. Yeah. Of course, it would be very pedantic to say these are like European exclusive things, but it just happens that when I look at the calendar, that's what it tells me.

2:50 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Actually, so this is what happened the last time we chatted. You say one line and then I have like six thoughts.  So first thing is I know some great Americans if you I'm curious about having some more conversations to understand American point of view.  Just let me know I know some really good people here who would love you The second thing This so I this is funny first of all, I never mind the Ireland UK thing so don't worry about that But I'm gonna do it back to you Spain in Portugal.  I've been in Spain, but never Portugal.

3:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I Loved Spain.

3:26 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I thought it was amazing So I didn't see a lot of it we saw Barcelona obviously I didn't like Barcelona all that much actually and I really loved Madrid I thought Madrid was fabulous, and then we went to a Girona, which is north of Barcelona, which was But what I loved about Spain Again being Irish everything worked It was relatively cheap The people were super relaxed and they had this blend of the old and the new that just worked really well  together. And I've lived in, I lived in Germany, I've been all over Europe, Spain was the kind as I've never been in Portugal.  But Spain was the one European country where I went, oh, yes, this is the mix. I really liked what, and I know I have a friend who lives down South in Malaga and she tells me it's totally different.  But yeah, so.

4:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like Spain. I like Spain. I think, so I live in Brazil now, but before coming to Brazil, I went to a job interview in Spain in Barcelona.  I quite like Barcelona. And maybe if I had gotten that job, I wouldn't be here. So it's so, so funny.  It's like, you can kind of imagine alternate realities up to a point. But like, if you go back enough, it's just like, yeah, that's a different person that I cannot imagine.  I would be a very different person for sure. I don't know in which direction, but for sure. But I'll explain, I have Spanish friends, and actually, I was talking about this the other day with the Portuguese, and this is not a very popular idea around Portugal, so being Irish, maybe you have thoughts on this.  Yeah. Because Irish, from my understanding, are also, you know, really proud of their independence, and you fought hard for it, and you paid price, and so on.  And so I think there's also some similarity there. And I was talking to a friend, were like, would it be better for the people living in what's now Portugal if we were all Spanish?  And so I'm like, I've always thought that that was a little bit of a traitorous approach to things. But then I was like, yeah, maybe there's some benefit, because there's a saying that when the Romans...  around the Portugal region, they had this thing, this phrase, there are people in the Iberian peninsula that they don't rule themselves nor did they allow others to rule them.  we and it's just like kind of fiercely anti-Athorian but also not very organized. Yeah, so that thought was kind of recent.  Maybe it would be better off if we were all Spanish, I don't know.

6:39 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I mean, well, so it's interesting. I think that's a very good analogy. Quick question. How many people in Portugal?  I was thinking about 10 million. that what it is? Yeah, yeah.

6:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's bigger than Ireland.

6:52 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  It's twice the size of Ireland. But you guys have what we have, which is for a small country, you're  have a massive influence on the world, which we have, right, too. And I like, I don't think that's tied to the physical country.  That is, that's a spirit, that's an energy, that's a, you know, I have wondered in recent years, too, with the world going crazy, imagine if the Brits took over on it again.  They can take over the land, but they'll never kill the spirit. maybe that's a similar thing. Quick thought for you.  And this would be an interesting conversation at some stage. I have a friend in Ireland in the university in Cork, Paudy, really good friend of mine, very good designer, like his business design thinking.  And he talks about and I think Portugal probably has something very similar. You know the word reverent or irreverent, right?  So reverent as you show up and you're very respectful of authority, and irreverence is the complete opposite. And he says that he thinks that the unique Irish trait is to be reverently irreverent.  And I think that's what you get away with as a small country, right? You have this. Does that make sense?  Like this, the Spanish, for instance, can't possibly have the outlook that you have, because you understand the big neighbor, but you're small and nimble and creative and different.  Does that make sense? I think, yeah, I think it makes sense.

8:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I also feel that it's a little bit of choosing where to play kind of thing, for instance, like very strategic.  It's just an emerging phenomenon, I suppose. okay, a couple of things that I find interesting. So I'm not too familiar with the specifics of Irish humor.  You're famous for being a humorous culture. Like making jokes and what is it, Crack, Crack? Crack? Crack? Crack? Is that Irish?

9:16 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Which is the same as the drug, Crack. We spell it C or A-I-C. Yeah, yeah.

9:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's amazing you know that. It's like, you know the thing like, oh the Eskimos have 17 words for snow and you know, the Sapir wolf kind of worth the kind of thing.  So it's funny the words that the culture keeps, right? Yeah. Because we're always using the same words, but some of them stick.  So that's one of yours, right? Ours is Soudada, which is kind of longing for, it's kind of nostalgia. That's a very Portuguese word.  Brazilians also have it. And, you know, like the feeling. Have sisu which is like balls and the German that I cannot pronounce it, you know happy when you forget gets Unfortunate things.  Yeah, exactly very German They don't help themselves that their branding is  and But so when I was talking about this.  Oh, yeah, so like culturally our we are I Snarky we're very snarky But we have this you know the whole power distance thing very familiar with the ghetto of steady the power distances I'm not I'm taking a note here I'm enjoying your comment about snarkiness because we like snarkiness because then we can be sarcastic.

10:44 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  We are very sarcastic Uh-huh, that's a big part of Irish humor.

10:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when you guys get snarky, we can be sarcastic So there's the thing called the cultural dimensions and it's from the guy  Oh, it's a Dutch guy. cannot pronounce his name, but I'll write in the chat. Oh, yeah. So this guy worked at IBM, I don't know, in the 70s, and he realized IBM has a way of doing things, but IBM around the world, they don't do things in the same way.  Yeah. So why is that? just criticism of this, but the idea is useful. There's like five or six cultural dimensions, which are like parameters, and different cultures have different parameters, right?  So I don't remember all of them, but for instance, like there's a leaning towards individualism and collectivism. Like the Dutch are extremely individual, I think the top of score, the North Americans as well.  The Chinese tend to be more collectivistic, Confucius influence cultures tend to be more collectivistic and so on. Masculine or feminine orientation.  This is a tricky one, because basically what it says that masculine orientation is towards achievement, conquest, you getting things, and feminine is about relationships, connecting, and so on.  Like the Italians are very masculine-oriented, Portuguese are more feminine-oriented. So there's a lot of these things, and one of them is power distance.  So power distance can be reflected in, for instance, the example they give in the book is that when you see policemen like in the UK, they have the high visibility vests, they don't have guns, and so on.  So they are made to be visible as a sense of there's people around you and they can be helpful.  In France, the power distance is larger, and police, they come across in a different way. I think, I think Catholic countries tend to have a larger power distance.  So like in Latin America, you also have a big power distance. I can example- I've never heard this before.  Yeah, it's changed my mind on how I think about it. Like in the Netherlands, power distance is very small.  like garbage disposal guy, it really feels intimately that is not, you know, less so than a doctor. Yeah. And it makes it, I can need to have different leadership styles and so on, because people don't necessarily automatically respect hierarchy.  You're not better than me. So anyway, in Portugal, power distance is lean towards the high. What this means is when you're, you know, talking to someone that has formal power over you, you know it and they know it.  So you need ways of, you know, navigating that and snarkiness is a way of doing that because you have plausible deniability, right?

13:44 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And I think a lot of our humor is kind of like that, you know.

13:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have a lot of self-deprecating humor. So I live in the Netherlands. They don't do a lot of self-deprecating humor.  No. That was weird because I do a lot.

13:57 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I have a couple of Dutch friends in it. the high energy, but that's not there for sure. Yeah, it's a different thing.

14:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And sorry, I went on a bit of a tangent, but I do feel that there's probably like a similar take on humor, like plausible deniability, being funny, but not getting in trouble with it, being opinionated, but, you know, finding ways of venting that without burning a lot of bridges, which I think by definition, makes communication a bit more nuanced because you have less bandwidth to communicate those things.  Like you need, the words make a lot of difference, right? I don't know, just.

14:42 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  No, you trigger a thought for me, is, well, here again, six, the first one. And I think that's one of the things I struggle with in the United States.  First of all, if I tell you the thing I love most about the United States is the land. Okay.  People are okay, but it's definitely the landscape. The landscape is stunning. But that ties me to the second part, which is in Ireland, at least when I was growing up, there wasn't much wealth.  We didn't have many things. There was and remains a strong sense that the country is ours, the land is ours.  The ocean is ours, the hills are ours, and it's there for everybody to enjoy. And there's a very strong, I would almost say energetic connection with the land and the weather and the whole.  And so you can still go back to Ireland and people's family name comes from the land. And so if I meet somebody Irish here and I get their last name, I can use  really tell you where they're from. And I don't know if that's the same in Portugal, but that is very strong connection.  And it's a it's a somatic felt. And I think that shows up in our experience of power too, which is some people and I had read this little bit of this is something I learned way back when I was in school, was a guy called Steven Luke's.  And he wrote a thing called the power debate. And he said that power is expressed in three ways. You have the power to set the ideology.  You have the power to set the agenda. And you have the power to make the decisions. And that's there were those three Steven Luke's L UK ES.  It's old, but it's really interesting. I went on chat EPT and I said, Can you update this for me for the the digital age?  And it was interesting. Because it brought in some other theorists who had added things like networks, the power of networks in this case, but by and large, the theory still holds.  I think one of our, and maybe the snarkiness comes from this too, although you were, Portugal was the power, Ireland was never a power, right?  Portugal was a global power. But I think one of our characteristics in Ireland is that we don't take people that have power all that seriously.  Because we've never had it and we've found ways to work around it. So we don't protest much in Ireland.  We don't protest in Portugal.

17:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We should claim.

17:40 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And then over a long time, we just break all the rules in Portugal. Yeah, yeah, like malicious compliance or kind of.  Oh, I got a, sorry, one last thing on that. I thought. And I need, I'm going to reach out to this person because this, whoops, I found this really interesting.  I don't know if you can see this. Can you read that?

18:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Why Irish people are making connections with strangers? Okay, yeah. I thought that was just me.

18:18 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And this lady who's an anthropologist at one of the universities wrote this whole thing about what she called the Irish connection grid.  Okay. It's fascinating. Here, I'll just read it just very short bit. said, I recently overheard a conversation between two German neighbors of mine who were meeting for the first time.  In fact, I had just introduced them to each other, remarking that they were both originally from the same country.  They proceeded to chat away on where they had grown up and quickly established that they originated from neighboring villages in the northern part of Germany.  Then they changed the topic and chatted about something else completely different. She said, I fell off my chair. We were in a pub.  But it wasn't that we were drunk, that caused me to fall off the chair. It was a missed opportunity to continue with the same topic and to establish, at a minimum, one person or place that they had in common.  Which is totally what we do. And I was like, ooh, I thought that was just me, apparently, as the whole country.  And it's that sense of connectivity, yeah, yeah.

19:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, that's...

19:29 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'll send you that, see if I can dig it up. Is there a Portuguese version?

19:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if there's... Go ahead. Sorry, last.

19:38 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And if there is a Portuguese version, does it also then convert over to Brazil? Because there's such a strong bond between the two.

19:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. I don't know. There's not an euphemism. I don't know that there is. to introduce people. It's like one of the pleasures in life.  But I do feel that I do feel that as a whole we are not associable. So I think we are more reserved and like it takes a little bit longer for people to get comfortable.  And this is something that I've developed in Brazil, which is like just speedrunning that process. And I mean, it's also about your own personality, the life you've lived and so on.  But I noticed that right now, as I am, I feel more comfortable with getting first, like being vulnerable or something like that.  And I think that's important, even like with old friends, that people don't know exactly how to deal with that.  they I think most people like your best friends of course they can deal with that but most people they get really it's weird because we are used to like self separating humor but at the same time maybe I'm not you know dosing it in the right amount because I'm influenced by Brazil I don't know it's it's I'm not finding the words to express what I want to say I think I'm wondering hear me if well this is one of these moments as an English speaker I say thank you because I don't have any I wonder if this is a similar in Ireland unless you are very close friends and definitely not with family you the conversation up here and if there's something going wrong you don't tell anybody and we're very we put on a face the whole time

22:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  You cannot fail in Ireland if you fail if you're cut off. So we used to say, especially in businesses, if your business has failed once, the system is unforgiving.  That's cultural, that's not.

22:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that might be it. I think also, it may be feel the same because you've also lived abroad for longer, which is like, even when you put down roots, you always know that that's not your original place.  And I think, at least to me, it gives me a sense of I can risk more. I can play my gringo card all the time.  Oh, it's not from around here. It'll just say weird . So at times, think people give you a little bit more of leeway.  And also, you get used to the idea. that is not like for instance my mom my mom is like extremely socially conscious it's so interesting this used to drive me nuts and now I can deal with it better like when she when my father is an engineer my mother is a language teacher and when we're talking about the problem or something to be solved my father will talk about the problem my mom will talk about the social connections of people that are involved in the problem oh yeah because that's the daughter I'm like I'm more close to my father that doesn't matter let's deal with this thing but but for her for instance she's like super uh let's not you know paint outside the line so and I think part of the reason why I immigrated was a little bit to get me on space yeah I can relate to that yeah yeah in in my hometown and it's interesting you brought up that so one second I opened the door for my kids that will ask to get in again in a second for sure  Okay, I'm back. Sorry. No, no, you're good.

24:07 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  You're So in my hometown, there's a joke about moms. If the joke is, and this is old, but there's a family at the beach.  There's a mom, there's a dad, and then there's a son who's maybe early twenties. And he goes for a swim, and he starts to drown in the water.  And the mother is running down the beach screaming, help, help, my son, the engineer is drowning. But it's interestingly, it's not the whole country, it's only our area.  And the other thing about Ireland, which is maybe interesting, is it's our culture is layered because the east coast was very much the Vikings and then the British.  the south coast was invaded by the dutch and the spanish and like the british got everywhere but there is a sense that our culture is layers that we claim to be Celtic but the Celts were 5 000 years ago and all these other the normans came from france right all these other influencers we don't talk about it's very it's interesting that way it's like oh yes we're Celtic well we were 5 000 years ago oh one last one very last thing on that note this is going back oh maybe 20 years we got to a a soccer world cup and we were the only country from the from the islands to no england no scotland no wales no northern Ireland and one of our comedians was  on the BBC and he was being interviewed and he said well everybody in the interview was saying everybody in England will be cheering for Ireland we were playing Spain and they beat us on penalties I said everybody in Ireland will be cheering for Ireland against Spain in the World Cup he said now if the shoe was on the other foot would you all be cheering for England and the committee went  no and the guy said well why not and he said 800 years of history it was classic you know so anyway yeah it's it's it's it's fine to see the parallels and and the quirks of the culture I never thought about it though which I love well I have to tell you one thing I'm going to tell you this and then I tell you one other thing I love that you're thinking of it of course from  Well, not that you're thinking it from a design perspective, but as a designer that you think of this, because that tells me a lot about you as a designer.  I had a thought recently and I need to do something about it. It would be really fun to put a conversation like this just on LinkedIn Live.  Because when I was thinking of you in the meantime, should just show you one thing. Don't hold me to what's on this image because it's not the best.  The MoMA stores here are pretty cool. This is not particularly cool, but there's pretty cool stuff in the MoMA stores.  These are the Museum of Modern Art. if you go to the museums themselves, there's a lot of cool stuff both in the museum but also in  in their stores yeah and most of it is kind of useless I mean I don't need any of it it just wanted you want it but I have to say why do I want it like I'm big into cars so we have lots of these little things and the reason I was the other day when we were talking and you were showing me the little things that you make and they're they are art thank you that they're prototypes let's take a think even the prototypes are art and I just somebody else that's interviewed today and said like oh well I just say these things and I was like yeah but what you don't maybe know is what that does for the person that's observing them it's you it opens up the whole world of creative possibility does that make

29:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Thank you. think that's a kind thing to say. I get it. And I also think that it's not the fact that I cannot stop myself from doing it that takes away the value.  mean, it's interesting. And I love, like, museum stores. I think museum stores are especially like science museum stores. They're really at that intersection of, like, it's well designed, it's quirky, does something different, changes the way you think about things.  I love, like, science museum stores. And give jobs as well. So, yeah. And I think, honestly, I want to do more of these things.  I want to, like, that's why I have the mad lab lab. In my LinkedIn, it's for that. But I never  or anything there and that's what do I want to say so first is I think you see me I feel very seen when you say these things the second one is I do think that physical products have mean qualities that they make you want to talk about them because they're funny or interesting or intriguing and a part of me is like oh I like to do more of this but the other one is like yeah maybe not as a business maybe as a hobby or just show more things right I mean you're the only person in the world that has seen this weird index card thing and maybe one of three one of three that saw the toggles the rockers I loved it and I think part of me is like I need to organize my life in a way that I have a constant outputting of that because the ideas they come and I there's nothing I can do I just write them down and put them in the box  but but then it's difficult to you know actually actually do them like my latest fixation is timers I do like small timers kitchen timers and this is magic this is magic tell me about the timers I think we spoke about you know the people that struggle with productivity know all the productivity tricks all the books yeah so and I I've realized you know timers are a great primitive you can just use timers to them and so on right but then you can start stacking up other primitives like tracking progress with the timers so each time you get to one Pomodoro you make a mark on it I don't know or you can okay let's let's see let's make this physical right so in front of me there's sorry  There's a calendar for times I've posted on LinkedIn, right? Which is kind of the Github. Yeah, I got something to show you back.

32:11 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  talking.

32:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so there's this thing, and this thing is one primitive. track progress. See if you've done the thing, right?  The timer is another primitive for time boxing. The index card is another primitive in the sense that you make it feasible and you can reorganize it and it's adaptable and so on.  So I really like the idea of primitives. yeah, if you think about timers, I'm like, what would be the best timer I could have?  right now, it feels to me that is a timer that's on a very practical level. I could just make it silent and maybe turn on a light or  the timer itself could have a slot where I place the index card. So the timer is the stand for the index card, you know, stuff like this.

33:09 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Dude, give me a minute. love this. Hold on a second. I've to go get to show you something. Okay.  Not because I'm saying, oh, now look at my stuff, but because of what you're evoking for me. So give me one second.  All right, you got it. You got to do some YouTube shorts.

34:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You have to.

34:19 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  have to. Can I, so I love this about the time.

34:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you ever watch YouTube shorts? Yeah, yeah.

34:27 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  There's a guy with a few things came to mind. I'm going to. These are only just examples. It's not to say that, oh, your stuff is like this, but I'll show you this one first.  A few years ago, I worked for a head of innovation and it was all data science. And I came across this book.  And it was these two women, one lived in New York and the other lived in, I think, London. And so what they decided to do, one was an artist and the other was a data scientist.  And so they decided. did that every day, they would send each other a postcard. And I'm just trying to see if I can give you a visual example.  OK, here you go. There's an example of the postcard. So very simple postcard. Name and address, and then here's the experiment.  And then that is the digital, the data visualization of this experiment. And every day they sent each other a postcard.  And so this book looks at, for instance, what is that? That is a, can you see it? It's a week of thank yous.  The number of times and how and where she either said thank you or people said thank you to her.  And it just looks at everything in life. Hang on a second. Here's one, a week of compliments, let me see, the number of times they saw birds and were the birds on their own or was it a flock of birds and just visualized every day the sounds they heard in a week and then they matched it up with this little book and the reason I say that is look I have no interest in timers except now I do because you create it in such a compelling interesting fascinating way and you tell the story really well like I'm now sitting forward and going what's he what's he gonna do with the timer so this is why the other thing I wanted to show you completely different do you know on youtube a guy called mark robert oh r o b

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  er No, but from the from the thumbnails I think I like him. Yeah, this is friends lab So one cool thing about mark robert.

37:19 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  He he lives here. So we we we see him from time to time. He plays soccer for our friends team um But he is all about science and teaching kids about science technology or the engineering and math Uh, but he used to work for nasa.  So he's super sharp and he does really fun things, but these little crunch lab kids This this is what this is the kind of stuff that he makes So you have to make this little box And I don't know you can see that carefully there's you know, it's suspended and if you look at it in different ways and then if you want to explore You  you pull the handle, right? And then, boop! I'm the spider. And it's fun, but it's all science. And so what he's doing as he creates this is he's explaining the science behind it.  Now, is this useful? No. Is it fun? Yes. Does it bring joy?

38:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does it bring joy? Yes.

38:28 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Did my kid make it? Yes. I'm only sharing this with you because as you show me these things, that's what you're creating.  You're creating these little moments. It's like just the postcard link. It takes about an hour to make one of these.  But there's a moment that you create that I won't forget now.

38:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is really good. And I really appreciate you showing me that. so I'm trying to figure out this is what I'm getting from you when we chat uh-huh thank you thank you so I'm gonna think out loud now right yeah as I said I feel really seen by you I think we have we share a language that makes it this conversation flow really well and I feel really seen by you like oh yeah it gets it and I think you get it in a precise way that it's not very common I think and so that's that's amazing feels amazing to be on on this side of you seem like a very nice person your stuff is fantastic so thank you thank you I really appreciate that and so what I'm thinking now is what's the signal  That I'm getting and how should I so so I have more stuff to show you, right? And I think I'm always a foundational feeling that I've had like my entire life is Because I like to make jokes is That people sometimes think that I'm being silly, but it's not really silly Sometimes it's it's fun, but fun is not silly and you get it you really get it But oftentimes people don't get it They're like, oh, yeah, it's funny.  You make jokes and you're making up the beginning to look and so on But you really get it and I'm really trying to you know capture the liking of this moment So here's what I'm thinking.  I'm as I told you I really like this Physicality of things that help you think right or help you be productive products that exist in between Knowledge work and physical stuff Have I should do the the Pinterest thing or not no so  Well, I've been trying to collect things for physical products for my company, Mesozoic, right? And I don't know exactly what to do with this because, you know, it's much easier to have ideas than to execute on these ideas.  But I feel like... That's name, the way, Mesozoic. You like it?

41:20 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Oh, I love it. Thank you. Thank you.

41:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it explains nothing but selects for the audience. It's perfect. I have a whole confluited way of connecting it to other things, but basically, I just wanted to signal that I like dinosaurs and science.  And so basically, mean, these are the sorts of things that I find really interesting. Imagine if you and I, we do a project, right?  And we get the mission patch from, like, oh, you participated in a Mercury launch. And everybody that joined the project gets a mission patch.  And you can put it on a jacket. I love this, you know, nerds, engineers, finding ways of game recognize game.  I know you weren't that, you know, those weird insignia for strange raider squadrons on Area 52 or something? Yeah.  So, I don't know, know exactly, exactly what I'm talking about. Yes, yes.

42:29 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  But I know that's the wrong shape, I know the ones you're talking about. Yeah. And I love this like this paper calculators, and you see, but, but, but this is a good but go ahead, go ahead, because that is, that is real engineering, that is real design that is figured it out.  Yeah.

42:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah.

42:52 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I love that's fabulous. Are you familiar?

42:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to send you a link and I think the Twitter of this guy. is it's quicker to convey the way it thinks than it's page but this is like uh thank you injected in my veins sort of thing like is a this is an actual rocket scientist that went into design it worked out you know i think jpl and rocket martin and probably making bombs i suppose but as a way of thinking that i find really and i don't know exactly i love that creepy magazine fan club yeah right because so i'm trying to show you these things not i'm not fishing for components i think that's important for me to say yeah no no no no don't worry that's not yeah i think you get it right that mean there's uh there's some things that carry a symbolic is i really like the word the phrase game recognize game and i'm like what can i do in my  work that, you know, creates opportunities for this, right? So, you know, yeah, I don't know.

44:08 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I have a blog post I'm going to do this weekend. I know now what it is, because you're showing me here the same way.  My blog this weekend is going to be called a trip to the bookstore.

44:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

44:25 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And this time I haven't read any of these books. And I just said some days bookstores are just chock full of new and wonderful ideas calling to be explored.  Here are some I found this week that are calling to me. And I'm just going to put the book covers similar to what you have here.  And it's just one medium. A book is just one medium. But these are multiple media. And I think so I'm just thinking  out loud now as you show me this. You know when we're at, actually this is helping me because I'm realized, you're helping me realize how I'm approaching things.  I don't want to fit into a niche. I don't want to tell you this is the problem I solved.  I'm trying to put different things out there that maybe evoke a response. And I think and that's the beauty you see of what you do here is in multiple ways you're putting beautiful things and beauty right in the eye of the beholder.  you're putting beautiful things out there some of which are quite technical and some of which are pretty and some of which are strange and of which are and all  and our attention. Yes. And in and in the nicest possible way, you're not shouting, look at me, you're like, I go back to cars, because I love the cars.  I love these little models. It's a little lunchy astratos from the 90s. And it's perfect. Yeah, it's such a beautiful car.  You know, and it's we have, there's, you know, especially here, I don't know, but everything has to produce something.  Well, we'll know that's not the way it works, actually. And again, I'm thinking out loud, my hope is that if we can show interesting, curious, beautiful things, that's somebody might make a connection between taking that moment and solving a challenge or realizing an opportunity or  or just pausing for a moment to think differently and I'll just leave my last thought for you. My big uber passion is what I call just creating spaces for people to explore.  It's like a curation and my hope is imagine if you could create those spaces and somebody who walks in the door by the time they walk out the other side they are changed for themselves.  And that's what I would love to see and this is what this does. It changes the perspective. And here's last thought.  I don't think you'd need to do anything other than just doing it. Even explaining it. I don't think you just put it out there.  Does that make sense?

47:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so. I'm sitting with it.

47:53 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  my other specialty is saying confusing things. So

48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let think about this out loud. I think one of my frustrations is that, and I feel comfortable saying this with you, but it's not, I guess, proper to say it to everyone.  But I do feel that I have taste. And I should find ways of communicating that taste. I do think that my failure mode is around feeling that I need to do the thing myself before I can talk about it.  And this, of course, it's impossible because there's so many things, so many crafts to learn. Things don't turn out well at first.  Keep talking, keep talking.

48:37 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm just reaching behind here. Uh-huh.

48:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, I can hear you. Yeah, I'm thinking. So what you said is the fact that I talk about this in itself is valuable, even if I don't execute on these ideas.  Which is liberating for sure. Because I think... like going very therapy moment. I think a lot of it is a mix between, want people to see me, but at the same time, I have these assumptions of the right way to see me is through my work and not me showing the work of others.  Of course, it's like this folder is hidden and it's not something you can find on Pinterest, it's a private folder.  In the part, go ahead, go ahead. All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

49:33 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I had two thoughts that came to mind. One was I was being a bit obnoxious, I was holding this up, but this is it.  Okay.

49:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The art of not making.

49:43 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I wouldn't buy this book, but. art of not buying the book. The art of not buying the book, but it's, you could probably Google it and read enough about it, but it is interesting.  And it's kind of what you described, which is there is art without you having to make it. And I would not hide this.  No, I'm not telling you you should put it out there. But actually what's fascinating is because you have a blend of beautiful things that you do make.  And so what gets fascinating and where I'm selfish in talking to you is that, oh, I want to know how he thinks.  You're showing me how you think. Which is, I mean, it's priceless, no? And even if that struggle is there, then that's even more of part of it.

50:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I mean, and also like from the outside, we often see people like friends that keep struggling with things that we know exactly how they could, you know, certain vent.  And I just suspect that like my hiccups or my hurdles are very obvious for outsiders. Just, you know, just.  show the stuff, be open, be confident, and I think one of the things I've realized in the past eight months or so was how much, maybe we spoke about this, don't remember, how much I was trying to fabricate, I think we did fabricate confidence by accumulating competence.  We spoke about that, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:28 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Well actually, so hold on, I don't know if we did, but it's something I'm familiar with, so go back over that ground, go back over that ground.

51:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If you want, but I... No, I want, I want, I'm trying to organize it in a way, because I think we both love the tensions, and I like them, I like the fractal conversations, but I'm trying to...  Okay. Honestly, I'm coming to the real... And there's no way of saying this without coming across as a bit of a jerk, but I should be more confident, right?  I think I do good work. I'm yeah, I can talk well with people. I think I'm friendly, but I don't feel that confidence that often which is And I used to think that oh, this is a signal that I need to you know, learn more things accumulate more skills and so on but the problem is that It's like climbing a mountain right you get to the top of the mountain then you see oh There's another mountain over there that I haven't climbed so Comparatively, I'm still dumb.  I'm probably dumber because now I see more mountains. That's haven't climbed Fabulous I'm gonna remember that sorry not your name, but the comment And I was like oh I've been going about is the wrong way that the nerdy way which is like let's just study things and that That will give me confidence, right?  And so recently I was like oh, I need to start with the confidence, but this is kind of a new muscle  and flexing, right, is a . So I'm trying to put more things out there, I guess.

53:09 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I have a thought for you. Let me show you something here very quickly. Let me stop the sharing. Thank you.  I just want to show you this. somewhere along the way, there's some people. When you have time, there's some people I definitely want to introduce.  I have time. This is a friend of mine, Natasha. This is her company, Unassuming Radicals. You are absolutely an unassuming radical.  Right, now she's in. This is her space. But check out that website. And she's basically on a bit of a retreat at the moment.  But when she comes back, we should Definitely have a chat And now so what does she mean by an unassuming radical and I want to offer a thought for you on the confidence thing, right?  first of all and I have totally stolen this word from her with her approval The word radical in English has two meanings The first one is obviously that energy that out on the edge Exploring trying new things that that edginess.  That's a radical but Radical actually comes I think it's probably Latin and it means deeply rooted and So she does that uses both words of that is to to be radical you have to be deeply rooted and He is a really good friend of mine, but she started off as my coach and I would say to her oh You know, I have lack confidence about these things and she  say to me okay so let's reclaim them. I would say what do you mean? And she says if I take your and I wrote that down because I just absolutely love that I see more mountains, what a brilliant line.  That's a brilliant line. You could say that is causing you concern or a lack of confidence or you could talk about the fact that you can reclaim it and say no that just means that you are endlessly creative endlessly iterative and instead of seeing those gaps as being deficient you see them as places to explore and by the way you're not selfish because maybe your art is in seeing the space and you bring somebody else in to make it so it's a collective it's not individual we don't have to carry that burden alone and but you were the first one to see it  Just to make a little leap, part of Tash's work, why this is so important, is she is a collaborative guide.  So when people come together, it often gets very messy. So she helps people manage collaborations successfully. And there's a whole body of work around that that's really interesting, if that's ever interesting to you.  And there's a thing called work with source. And so in this situation, while you would be the source, you have seen something that nobody else has seen.  You can't get there on your own. So you're inviting other people into this creative field. And the ones you want to work with are the ones who show up because, A, they respect your vision.  And B, partnering with you a allows them to manifest their aspiration. And the governance is, the vision we are pursuing is Drow's vision.  If somebody else wants to change that, that is a second thing. It's not changing yours, it's the second thing.  Does that make sense? So the whole, the whole idea of that to link back to the confidence piece is, I'm, listen, I am, I actually wrote a little piece today about that is I'm trying to stop.  It's like with design, I know enough design to be able to design things for myself. But then I thought I was a fraud because if somebody asked me to do a whole design session, I like, Oh no, I can't do it.  And I see the need for it. Yes. And what I'm learning is, is that enough? Yes, because I know as well, and I can call him if we need it.  Does that make sense? that's why I already know more than most people. And part of that knowledge, again, this is why I got this book, is to know that the art is in the seeing.  And then if I bring you in, we make more art together. But so I guess long story short is what you might feel as a lack of confidence is actually just actually it's you seeing the whole system.

58:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A couple of things. Thank you.

58:46 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Well, thank you back.

58:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think of people are like, maybe you know them already. I'd like to introduce you to as well. not to turn this into a therapy session, I think my one of the things that, you know, gives me up the most is a sense of scarcity.  Like I need to realize that idea because if I talk about the idea and somebody else does it, I'll lose that idea.  And I have this kind of vampiric way of looking at good stuff. When I see good stuff, my first instinct is like, oh, this is good stuff.  My second instinct is I need to do this. I need to make this, you know. And sometimes it's really counterproductive, I think most times.  So, and I think I would unlock so much if I could, you know, not feel that way, that I need to do the thing to actually get something out of it.

59:52 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I don't want to interrupt you.

59:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, it's a nuanced thing that I know. to understand. But it also feels like it holds so much back.  Like it holds back on many aspects like, oh, this confidence, this confidence shows up in how your price works.  This confidence shows up in how you, know, all sorts of things. And if I think my, my vehicle, my engine of creating confidence is making things, climbing mountains, I'll never get there.  So, and there's another thing. Sorry. There's another thing that for me is I haven't really been able to square that circle, which is I don't have an internal furnace of confidence.  So if I don't get feedback for a while, my confidence starts to drop. So I need like constant refilling of that.  It's a bit annoying, I guess, but it is what it is. I've learned that about myself. And one of things that really gets to me is the idea of  people not noticing the things you do right and this whole like this whole like algorithmic  that you create something brilliant but no one sees it because somebody else's I'm like oh what's that and I know this is silly silly even to say it out loud was like so what's the point the point is the thing I know I know the point is the thing but like I want people to see the thing I don't want just to do that yeah and I don't know how to how to how to change that perception I think there's a bunch of things by the way this and this is a good thing so when I say this to you you you have recording of this right a transcript yeah it would be really fun afterwards to throw it into that GPT and see what it surface right and so so one of the things I want to listen it's not that I have a book for everything but today you're bringing up that I have a book for there you go it's a new one this is a new one yeah and I got this because I'm really trying

1:02:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  to practice this and I have things that Natasha told me which was really interesting. She said be careful because she said most people think of abundance as a good thing and it is but when you go down this path you will also have an abundance of challenges because the more you see the more challenges come up but the thing I wanted to kind of put back to you is and I'm just thinking this through but bear with me I see things like above the line and below the line above the line are the things we do or how it's expressed you know your designer consultant innovator engineer all those things are there other people that do that absolutely right do we spend  most of our time competing above the line, yes. But below the line is you. And everything that you put above the line comes through you.  And therefore, when you show me this stuff that's behind the scenes a little bit or show me the things you make, that's how I interpret the difference between you and somebody else who says they're doing the same thing.  It's the language you use. It's the prototypes you share. It's the quirkiness in your humor. It's the fact you have a catch.  It's these things that you can't control, but they're helping me decide whether I like working with you or whether I like working with somebody else.  And if we keep them away, then there's no differentiation. Does that make sense? The more of the individual I can see, the more it allows me to really understand what working with you would be like because, yeah, there's a bunch of people that are really good designers, but maybe they don't listen that well or actually I don't really like their color palettes when I see what they've got behind, right, or not actually prepared to take your risk.  They're all about production, production, production. Or as I'm conversation, I feel my way to what's important. so, I mean, it's in a word I would say to you, I, on your behalf, wouldn't feel any need to have a lack of confidence, but I can't do anything about it.  All I would say to you is that there are, there's a commitment. community of people out there who will, who will see you.  And oh, there's a there's a lady, for instance, there's a lady I met on this LinkedIn class. And I agree with you about the algorithm, by the way, it's .  But I have an idea what we might be able to do there. But her name is Jess. And she is a visual, branding person.  And she is brilliant. And what she puts out is just, it's magnificent. And I sent her a note this morning.  And I know Jess, and I sent her a note this morning. And I said to her, I'll show you some, I'll ping you on some of her stuff.  I said, Hey, I loved your post this morning. I said, there's so much value in that one post alone.  And I said, the ideas are, the ideas you're sharing and the way you're engaging with them are awesome. love the vibe and energy.  And she came back and she said, Oh my God. she said, I nearly didn't put that up. I thought it was really obvious what I was saying.  eventually, my wife told me I had. So I guess that's my way of saying there's what we feel behind the scene itself.  And then there's how other people interpret it. And does that make sense? I think so.

1:06:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:06:29 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And I think it comes to pricing. We tend to price based on what it is we're feeling ourselves, because we don't have an understanding of how people are interpreting it.

1:06:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yes. For sure. For sure. And then it's also a little bit of self-reinforcing, right? You're not sure they see it.  You price according to what you think they see that you understand it's probably fraction of what's possible And then you get that money, but you know, it could be more.  mean one of them one of the things that I Mean, you know focusing on as a feeling like stay with the feeling is Up to a certain point it's very nice to be a Hidden gem like all this kind got to be lucky.  They don't know how lucky they got Because that gets old. Yeah, I know my stuff they they are really lucky and I'm happy that you know, I can help them But Not too much right they need to have some some notion of that and sometimes I'm like why So we  we follow the comfort, right? We're like, I'm comfortable in this mode of operating. So I'll shift this project into this mode of operating.  Sometimes I don't even notice it, right? And if you are a person that spends a lot of time in your own mind and you address life by thinking about things, you try to fix problems with that tool, hammer, nail.  And one of the things that I've noticed is that for me, oftentimes the challenge is not really a creative challenge.  It's like an execution challenge. know what? Just get a sales script. Eventually you'll make it yours, so adapt it.  It will get better and not as forced. But you don't need to discover the selling principles from first hand.  And I think that's something that I've noticed more. So I'm doing less of, but I used to do this all the time.  oh, I'm going to figure out positioning that no one has ever seen. use original. But that's kind of a dangerous thing, like to be too different.  And then we complained, ah, people don't see me. Of course they don't see you. trying to be different, so yeah.  So, yeah. Sorry. No, just, there's so many open loops, and I'm trying to keep them in my RAM memory.

1:09:29 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I think, so, so I have a, there's a few different thoughts that across my mind. I mean, I've not seen the TV show Severance, but I've heard people talk about it here.  It's about how your work life and your home life are completely severed. And I appreciate that on LinkedIn. I'm supposed to be putting up stuff that attracts people to me so that we can do business.  I really, Realizing that most of my work opportunities come in through other consultants Mm-hmm, where I can fill a gap.

1:10:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

1:10:09 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  They don't have and Most of the time They're not oh, maybe they are I don't know if they're finding me because of what I put on LinkedIn or not But did I find you but I will tell you that I I Said this to my wife yesterday was interesting.  I said well I stopped working in corporations four years ago and Nobody in my network has helped me Nobody mm-hmm in my my old work network.  Yeah But people I hardly knew have been amazing And that in there's a lesson in there somewhere only way these people know me is through LinkedIn.  So the reason I brought up severance is sometimes I put stuff, I like working with small or medium level teams and big companies because they're so stuck and their work is so crap that I like to be able to say to them, hey, and I appreciate you saying about me seeing you, that's also selfishly that's what I enjoy doing.  hooked on seeing people's potential. love it. It's brilliant. And everybody has potential. So I come into a middle level team and I look at them and I say, you guys are awesome.  What are we doing? And it gets energy and then people can be creative and then we solve the problems.

1:11:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's fine.

1:11:41 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  We can solve the problems then. And I think I showed you, I have my own products for how I do that with little cards and things.  But where I was going with this, the only way that I can feel like I'm me is that when I put stuff on LinkedIn, it's a mixture of  practical tools that you can use to solve a problem. And something that's personal, like, I can't learn everything I thought I could learn everything and I can't.  And so  it, let's just do the best we can. And I have a small community of people that I know see me and are very supportive.  And then every now and then somebody random appears and says, I've been following you for six months. And I love it.  Can we do X. I'm like, Oh, yeah, absolutely. Where did you come from? I don't know. And I guess what I'm trying to say there is that again, with the severance is such a good idea, that's what the world demands.  You could be 100% business focused. And then what you do at home, who cares? Or as I go, no, that's not how it works.  Who I am informs what I care about and how I do it and who I want to do it with.

1:13:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  absolutely and and and also like yes I think it was yesterday maybe the day before yesterday I commented on post from Jay Malone and so Jay was talking about I mean we've chatted a few times I think we're internet friends and Jay was talking about when people they try to connect with you but you kind of feel that there's another motive for that and we recognize that yeah yeah but the thing is I was really like am I doing that yeah sometimes there's like a little bit of that for sure I'm not going to pretend that there isn't but it's a very strange world to navigate because in a sense that  J, I felt this as well with you, too, which is like we do an uncommon thing. And we're very useful to people not really getting it.  And so when you feel when you find somebody that gets it is you want to talk to the person, right?  But at the same time, sometimes you operate in a similar space or you are kind of competitors in a way, it's weird, right?  And to me, like, Jay made that comment. And I don't think it was a dig or anything. But I was like, like my first doing that today, like am I tired kicking, you know?  And I think because what we do and who we are, who we are is really the opposite of service is difficult to split it.  Sometimes you get into this strange, I haven't yet, you know, figured out how to do this. The more relaxed I get, the better.  But sometimes getting to this strange dynamic, like Am I being the fact that I am aware that there's something here in terms of work makes me disingenuous or should I just assume you know it's a new kind of relationship I didn't have before but I'm learning how to live with.

1:15:19 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So I have a very strong thought on this but it's very new it's only the last couple of weeks.  It's not disingenuous and by the way keep up in books at you this is another great book because what we're doing and I'll pull a quote out of here and send it to you later but we are asking people to change the narrative that's what we're doing we're asking them to think of their world in a different way and that's really hard and that's the confidence thing can come up we shouldn't it's actually celebrate it you are out there trying to change the narrative.  And so that's why I you know salute you on that and don't don't let that be something that causes you lack of confidence But here's what I was going to say.  I have a friend in the UK who we should also chat with it crazy. His name is John And I'm he's American Three times over the last few years.  I have tried to do something with John and Each time it failed and each time we didn't talk to each other for about six months out because we just her and And then one day out of the blue he texted me and he was like as if not And he was saying yeah, I saw this thing and I was thinking of you and then I thought well We hadn't chatted so I could probably tell you and I'm not talking about what happens So now I have a choice and The choice that went through my head was okay.  Why did it bring on the last three times and Why was I so happy to get his text? And I realized I was happy to get his text because as my friend  he's fabulous, he's great fun, he's crazy and I love his energy and I realized that trying to push it towards a transaction had blown everything up so I responded straight away and then we had a chat and we were having good fun having the chat and I said to him I'm gonna say one thing to you and he's like what and I said let's try to do something together he starts laughing he said well I said because that's where we get all  up but I said I love the conversations because I take them away and I can make something out of them myself somewhere else and he said to me he said I'm able to do the same and I said great well then that's our transaction said we're friends we swap up all this energy and ideas and I said we don't do them together because we kill each other but we're like a muse for each other and I think that and it's and then you realize oh

1:18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's friendship that's what friendship is yeah it gets stronger each time you go through yeah it's funny I mentioned that because there's a person I've met on LinkedIn for the first time I met him I was like oh it's like doing the thing I want to do but he's way ahead of me I'll never make it you know the whole scarcity but eventually I think I was having a beer here in Brazil I was like screw it I'm gonna send a message and I sent him a message and then we got to talking and we could see each other really well so that was nice and eventually an opportunity to do work together came and we started to do work together and then things went south right and to this day I feeling like I think it thinks that  as a bit of a maverick or maybe not aware of some dynamics of the project or that I went too fast on some things and so on others and I feel like that he didn't listen to my points and my attempts of so both are left to the thing like on bad terms I would say you know and for me the bad terms was like how could you assume that I was trying to be somewhat malicious like have you not know me have I'm not you know being vulnerable enough for you to understand that's not our role and I think for him was I think the project was really important and it felt that maybe I was you know being a diva or something you don't strike me as the diva yeah I don't know I also don't think I am but yeah from what he told me that  I think that was also the weird thing. Like I felt really seen by him, but when things went south, I thought, how can you think that that guy would be doing these things?  that's not, I didn't know. And so right now, my feeling is like, that's really a shame, you know? That's really a shame because, and that's exactly the last words we said to each other.  it really is a shame, but kind of snarky, know? He said, it's a shame because we are getting this project that you would fit in.  And I felt, oh, you're trying to hurt me. And I felt, I didn't say this, but my feeling was like, you didn't see how good I was doing at this thing.  So it's a shame. I didn't say it, but so the thing is like, right now I'm at this point, like it is a shame.  I mean, that's, that's a person I like their stuff. I admire them. They helped me with some stuff. And whenever I see like their posts on LinkedIn, I'm like, part of me is like a  great post.  And a part of me is like not a fucker, you know?

1:20:55 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And I can totally relate this. And now I'm thinking like, yeah, maybe you should.

1:21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to mend that relationship. But I don't know exactly how to do it. Anyway, you just planted these ideas that maybe you can just talk and not be working together.

1:21:11 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  yeah, I limit, I have a thought for you. Let me do something. I just got a text. My wife wants me to bring something in from the car.  I need to hit the toilet.

1:21:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  this is perfect. Five minutes. I'll be straight back. Hold that thought. Okay.

1:26:24 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm back. I I I Yeah, I was just thinking that's something funny to show you here. Yeah, as regards the friend I think there's a moment when you have a like a feeling and I think it's over time you just got it and then and then when the moment comes the moment comes I There's a the guy I was talking about John Who we should death  have a chat with because he is he's good he's good fun and and now we're at the other end of that but there's a mutual friend of ours in the UK as well Martin he's somebody else that's like overtime which Martin's a designer as well but he's he's retired now Martin and now he's a beekeeper but he has this great a little expression that he told me that I now think every day and it's um he says show be present tell the truth and then let it all go and it sounds like you've done that with that guy so now it's on it's whatever the problem was problem sounds like it's on his side I'm sure I'm sure I know things that I could have done better for sure um yeah yeah I mean it's about I guess it's about time and sometimes I'm a little bit impatient with these things

1:28:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Yeah, and I Agree, I mean eventually because now what happens is we don't have to you know Spend too much time on this part of the conversation, but basically what happens now is like I find stuff and I'm like Oh, I need to send this to that guy just do just do but I don't him but I don't want him to think that I'm trying to Be sneaky trying to get more work or something like that, you know Yeah, but maybe I should just I've done I've it's a lot of things which is like I've I thought someone oh you need to talk to this guy But I haven't sent things to him anyway, well, I his last thought for you I am There is a moment in time when your Desire to just make that connection And that's the

1:29:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  woman to do it. then you just show, because that was the thing I realized with John was like, I miss this guy.  Nothing else matters, actually. And then, and then I was able to say to him straight up, I was like, I don't want to do anything with you.  But you are my friend and I miss you when you're not when I'm not actually with you. So you know what I mean?  So but that's that took six months. Yeah, I had another thought going back to previous part of the conversation.  And I brought some props. So I show you and there's another reason why showing what's going on in the background differentiates.  So by now you know, like my house, my son, and I are like all sorts of these around. But I have a really cool story.  And I wanted to show you these two and tell the story as an Audi and a Nissan. during a whole  There might have only one son and he's 12, so during COVID he was like seven, eight. And we used to go to the store and we would look and collect these cars.  these ones are a little more expensive, but the cheap ones were $1 a car. And so we were looking for this one particular car.  was a Toyota Supra. And we couldn't find it anywhere. And then one day online, I discovered that there was a collector store for hot wheels in a city about 10 kilometers away.  So I said nothing to Luca, my son, and I drove him over and we pulled up outside the store and you couldn't see what was inside.  And I said, oh, we need to go into the office building. And he was like, OK. And he walks open the door and his eyes just went hot.  So all the hot wheels. So he's looking through all the cars and he finds this Toyota Supra that he's been looking for.  And we go up to the counter and the guy behind the counter except the car, and he says, ooh, that's a good one.  And I, and he was a really nice guy and turned out later, he had kids the same age and, but he said to my son, do you know why that's a good one?  And Lucas said, yeah, cause it's a Toyota Super and I wanted it. And he said, but why this particular one is good?  And now I knew there was a story and I was curious about the story. And so I said, no, he said, why is this a particularly good one?  Take a moment. So this guy had two businesses. One was he sold Hot Wheels. And the other was, you know, the movie like the Fast and the Furious?

1:31:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:31:45 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So he, he tunes those cars. Drift cars. Ah, okay, okay.

1:31:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that is, but the real ones, not the real ones.

1:31:53 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And so he is connected. This guy here is connected with the Fast and Furious production crew. And so he,  said, I should dig out that actual real car. have it around here somewhere. But he said, okay, so this car, he said, in the $1 Toyota, he said, this is a real car.  And he goes out and he pulls up his laptop. And he starts to show us the tuning company in LA called Grady, that actually built this white Toyota Supra.  And then he gets to the picture of this guy is Ken and Ken is the CEO of Grady. And by the way, that guy there in the car, he said, that's the driver.  And he flips to another page and he does an orange Toyota Supra that you use in a Fast and Furious movie.  And he goes, that's the car. They built that car for this movie. That's the driver who's in the movie.  And he said, that's Ken's company. And then he looked at me and he said, he said, don't buy the car today.  I was like, what? he said, come back to me in two weeks. And so here's the last part of my prop.  me one second. But anyway, long story short is we went back to him in two weeks and he said he had been in LA in the meantime.  And he came back with the $1 car signed by the guy who made the car, the guy who drove the car in the Fast and Furious movies.  And so what I loved about it was, and his whole point to us was, you guys came in to buy a $1 toy.  What you didn't know was all of this backstory, the fact that Mattel puts that much thought into how they designed these little cars.  And that my last talk for that uh oh run around the house my last talk for that was uh this car is modeled on a famous 1990s um Nissan race car and so i found it on youtube and it was really interesting all that whole season this car had been in a race for the title with this Audi and it actually had a really tragic end the driver of this car was killed in a crash with the driver of this car well and hot wheels produced this last year and then last month came out with this and so that was where i kind of go okay 99% of people go into a store we'll see a toy yeah but there is actually a tragic incredible story about those two cars and that's why i look at it and go yeah  car. But I'm fascinated by how that company picks which cars to make. And again, most people don't know that that whole backstory is there.  And so my point, big long-winded point is when you share what you're creating and how you're thinking about it, and even some of the vulnerability behind it, it makes the eventual thing much richer.  And I think anybody who might be tempted to work with you will go, I want that because he will see what's behind it for us.  But if you just rock up and go, hey, I produced these things, I don't know that you take all that time.  Does that make sense?

1:35:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it does. Sorry, that's a long-winded story. No, no. Everything connects for sure. My wife thinks that, my wife thinks that I'm an artist trying to be corporate, but I'm afraid of being creative.  So yeah, yeah. I think there's one aspect. come back a lot to the upgrading thing, because I think that was the definitive social archetype that shaped how people, you know, meet and interact in the past decade, which is like there's a thing in the middle that decides if you get to meet or not.  And this thing has wishes and preferences. And if you look at the history of mankind, this is like a blip.  is nothing, ten years of algorithmic mediated relationships is nothing. And in maybe three years or so, everything will be swarmed, swamped or drowning in authentic AI.  And I think we have maybe three years to make friends online.

1:37:22 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And then your ex-friend will be an AI agent.

1:37:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and then you really don't know because, you know, it gets really good and the video is amazing, you know.  And I see people talking about this, like, let's just go back to mid-space and so on. But it's funny how that expectation was, you know, branded into our own model of the world, like, yeah, if I do something, people will see it.  And then you look at the biographies of artists and like, no one cared and they did it for decades, you know, sometimes.  feels in a way that to make peace with the idea that you do it because you need to do it and maybe some people will see it, most people will not see it.  It feels like making peace with that idea is a return to how creativity gets found in real world, right?  That was not normal, making a cool video and everybody and like a million people seeing it over a course of that's not normal.  Yeah, that's now not what our expectations should be and and I mean I mean consciously I can I can say this but I haven't yet you know reached the stage where I embodied this awareness but you know it's like when you publish something and LinkedIn shows it to a thousand people and you're like, what the  it's just a thousand and that's a lot right and me like a good day a very good day is like it touches a thousand but it's usually like 600 and it's it's difficult not to you know comparison and so on.

1:39:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Let me just check something here. Second, I'm going to go on your profile. Check something out. So if you're getting a thousand impressions, all right, this is really interesting.  So you have 3000 followers. You're getting a thousand impressions for each post.

1:39:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At best, I think.

1:39:20 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Just hold on to that for a moment because why did I this again was I use chat gpt for this because I was curious and I asked chat gpt what was the average number of impressions that people on LinkedIn got for their posts over the entire available data set.  And it is less than 0.1 of a percent. Right. That is when somebody posts to LinkedIn, typically the number of impressions they get is less than 0.1 of the connections they have.  You're getting 33 percent. Just hold that thought for a moment because the people who are going to pay attention to you are overwhelmingly not going to click a like or leave you a comment.  The only ones who do that are the people who are your friend or know you or have a sense that you want this promoted.  The vast majority of people read it, internalize it, and you don't even know they were there. Keep that statistic in mind.  Even if you're getting a hundred, you are still getting what, three and a half percent when most people are getting point zero one.  I give you two examples of this. Can you hold that for a second?

1:40:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. time to rain and it was a window. I'm really sorry. go, go, go, go. I'm back, thank you.  So you said hold that thought about the percentage.

1:41:20 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  The reason here is the reason I want to give you. The biggest individual deal I ever got working on my own was somebody who responded six months later to a LinkedIn post I had written and I had no idea they had even seen it or liked it.  I didn't know who they were. And it got me a gig at Google for three months. Last year that was 2023.  Last year I wrote a post in July and this is I called it radical readiness. This was what I stole from from that Natasha the radical piece.  I still to date I think 16 people have liked that post and then somebody called me in September from.  Austin and said hey we have a conference called Radical Creativity. It's for in-house creative agencies and they're under so much pressure.  Can you come and turn that one minute post into a 30 minute keynote? I had never given a keynote.  I certainly hadn't written 30 minutes about it and so they flew me to Boston and put me in front of a 350 people as the last speaker of their conference to talk about radical readiness.  So it's not a lot, it's only one a year that produces a big outcome but it gave me a sense that wow when you put something you have no idea who's seeing it or responding to it.  yeah and so you just get you have to keep putting it out there because it's brilliant and you don't know what you're doing for somebody you know and I'm kind of a I wouldn't have said this out loud before but I'm maybe a little bit spiritual I kind of like if you put that good energy in the world it has to come back to you.  It has to.

1:43:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  by the way i am saying this stuff to myself here in this moment as much as i am saying it to you right so yeah no i understand i yeah i i guess um thank you and i guess that a lot of it is really the expectations right um i i see like those pledge pmm guys and like i like them you know and i'm like oh my god they got like a hundred thousand followers sharing this stuff and i'm like am i like we always assume that we are the main character of reality right like am i shadow band did linkedin you know oh yeah yeah are they throttling my stuff and then you talk to someone else and say oh these are my numbers this happened the other day i was talking to a guy and the guy was really happy and we had like very small numbers and the guy said oh i'm really happy with this and i'm like wait wait wait i'm not being snarky not being sarcastic these are your numbers yes and you're happy with it yes  OK, because these are my numbers and I was not happy with it. I thought I was being short changed and said, no, no, no.  I think this is normal. OK, I think what I don't like is the feeling somebody called it digital sharecroppers.  You're just fitting the machine and maybe the machine will throw some crumbles at you. But it is, but it is.  It is.

1:44:24 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  It is. oh boy, I've gone back and forward this so often to These conversations are amazing for me because I'll go away and be this high enough for the next few days because we've had this conversation.

1:44:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Same.

1:44:44 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And it gives confidence and energy and enjoyment. And I'm talking to somebody who's from Portugal in Brazil. Wow, this is so cool, right?  it's all good things, right? And I realized when I sat and had a really big look at why do I put stuff on LinkedIn.  Ultimately, it's because it's a place I can express myself and if I let go I'm I'm just learning this now, right?  So it's not like wisdom But if I let go of that, this is why I liked Martin's thing of show up be present tell the truth and let it go Because if I can learn to let it go Then I enjoy doing the posts.  Yeah for me and then the people who interact with them tend to be awesome people I'm like You can never have enough awesome people, you know And then here's the last thought I have I Had a brilliant experience this week.  I went to a conference in in Texas And it was in Austin, Texas, which is a cool city. It's not like the rest of Texas, which is crazy and it was a conference for these middle-level marketing teams and It was about  If you if you go do a deal with a lot of big tech companies, they bring you to their campus and have what they call a briefing center Yeah, yeah, so I used to work in a space and I still kind of do some work in there and so I went there and I met I Had a friend of mine who runs one for a chip company AMD and he said to me you need to talk to the guy who runs Miro You know Miro So I met the guys who run Miro.  Nice And they were brilliant But they were like, oh my god straight away this guy Sid and like Sid was funny because my buddy Nathan he had a I had Customized a set of my cards for the conference And so Nathan had gone over to Sid and he says hey, you need to meet John and he goes Why do I need to meet John and then he goes well because you need to talk about these Sid walks over to me holding these and he goes one of these So we got his  conversation and of course his first thing is he said I love these we can put these in Miro for you if you want he said what I said why don't you actually come over to our center and let's look around so we'll go over the center he shows me around and we just talked and it's not that there's an opportunity there but I partner with a small company and the lady who runs it like super wealthy and Sid was over there and he said that we need to bring John to Amsterdam he said can you figure that out so I don't know if it happened or not but maybe there's a chance to go to Amsterdam in June in Hawaii because we just had a conversation yeah yeah and and a personal one right I mean it wouldn't happen if it were a scripted k-faby kind of thing yeah and yeah so a joke is when you're Irish you say 10 words when one will do but

1:48:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. Now, it's true. Thank you for saying that. mean, the only, it's very interesting, like the only way in which I get this stuff at LinkedIn is when I think about the increase of my formal audience.  Everything else has been good. I've met people, I've made friends, I've had amazing conversations. Some opportunities came up. I've gotten better at, you know, talking about what I do all upside.  I only get pissed off, and maybe I get pissed off because of the poor expectations. If that's the case, that's self-inflicted.  I only get pissed off when I'm like, where are my Brazilian followers? I need my Brazilian followers. I've been paying my dues for the Brazilian followers.  And I think, it comes to think of it, I'm just talking to you right now. I think, so when we look at the people we follow online,  Sometimes it's like a mix of, oh, somebody that I know, somebody that I think I could learn something from, somebody I want to eventually get into a relationship to maybe do some work for them, somebody that I've worked with in the past and some family members.  There's like all these sorts of things, right? But when you start following these people giving you advice for content, it's because we're gonna create performing content, right?  Next thing you know, like your time is full of people that maybe they are saying good things, but they just make you feel like  because they know exactly which buttons to press.  And I remember there's a guy, Matt, that like one of things that made a huge difference for me was starting to have conversations like this, like meeting people online, let's chat, we should do it, right?  It was really good for me on the conference level, meeting people, know, the whole thing. And so this guy was created at some post, like this is like LinkedIn growth stuff.  And he was like, yeah, it's not about the coffee chat conversation. stations, virtual coffees, it's about closing in on the DMs, and I was like, , I was so happy with my coffee shats, and now this guy is making me feel inadequate for not being like a conversion machine.

1:50:14 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Is this Matt Barker? Oh, no, Lacazhev, I think it's... Oh, I will tell you, honestly, like, pardon my French,  these people.  I mean, just because their experience is X does not mean that that is the experience. I had a guy here, just very quickly, I had a guy here in San Francisco who said he wanted to do some work with me, and we were talking, and I was trying to bring some ideas to him, and he said to me, he said, I make all the money, he said, that's...  We know that, right? So he said, my decision is the one that counts, and I was like, we're done, we're done, because money is just one measurement of a whole system.

1:50:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The guy actually said that. Those words came out of his said that.

1:50:57 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So I'm like, we are done, and I like... for you, you know. So it's the same with this guy.  What's his name? Yeah, whatever.

1:51:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, good for you.

1:51:10 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm glad that there's a metric that celebrates you. Next.

1:51:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think all of this ties back to the radical thing that you've mentioned about your friend, Natasha, that to be, so you really need to get, that's how I'm paraphrasing it, like you need to get really good at being you.  And it is, it is true. mean, I felt that the more I am myself, the better things tend to go.

1:51:50 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I have, this is, I'm trying to do the same. hear me out here a second. If, let's say I was in a company and I had a budget and I wanted to do something creative, knowing you as I do now, you'd be the car person I'd call without a hesitation.  Because you clearly understand me, which means you said to me earlier on about feeling seen and I should have said the same back to you because I do, I feel seen by you, right?  For lots of reasons, not least because you know I love to learn things so you keep showing me things.  I love this, I love this. So, is connection possible in a way that Aaron's opportunity for you? Absolutely, you demonstrate that.  I guess where I'm going to make kind of a leap is the type of content. I love what you put out there.  I'm also, because a conversation with you is fantastic. And I, by the way, I want to do it again.  And can you put some of you, like this, onto LinkedIn so that people can actually experience you? So is it a video?  I've got a friend, Johnny Moore in the UK. Johnny's another person. Be interesting. He has a little company called Unhurried.  And one of the things he does is he takes a GoPro camera. He walks, he lives in Cambridge in the UK, which is very Harry Potter-esque.  It's very pretty. And he just walks around the street chatting. And for two minutes, that's all he does. And he just, he makes an observation.  He wonders whether other people see things similarly or differently. then he asks a question at the end. And that's it.  And it's a hundred

1:54:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  percent Johnny.

1:54:01 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And so you know who he is before you ever think about I wonder could I do something with him.  And so that's the one thing I feel really lucky I can talk to you so I get a really strong sense of who you are and what matters to you.  And so again I'm saying this to myself maybe as much as I'm saying to you is well maybe we put that on camera a little bit more often.  You have an advantage over me you're a good-looking dude too so lots of that's very shallow but it helps.  But you're also living in a really interesting place right you're in you're in Brazil which most of us in this part of the world know nothing about other than it seems exotic.

1:54:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Brazil also to me it feels exotic. But yeah I mean you've you've you've there's a saying here in Brazil.  Brazil has a lot of funny things one of them is that So when you're living rent free on somebody's mind, but one of them is like you've rented a triplex on my mind.  So you're really living large on my mind. So maybe I'm seeing this to myself. I think the... I think the...  Second. Do need this? I need do a copy of the pressure in my mind, but first I do a of the pressure.  Okay. One second. Just a second. Sorry. I think the pressure is... I can't see. It's not mine. It's mine.  You know how to do a copy? I'm back. Sorry. So wife is back behind the partition. That's where we keep the printer.  So maybe I'm saying this to myself as well, which is this all, you know, come across as an expert top leadership and so on.  And, and then the whole creative timers, jury rigs, trinkets, it seems to go against that. And then I'm like, I think that's the most me I can be, but at the same time, some of these, these kinds of square, I don't know if they like it.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I love it.

1:56:46 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Look what you're saying, by the way, so that hold on, I'm trying to find something I wrote. Bear with me.  And listen, on the time check, I probably have about 10 minutes, just for today.-hmm.

1:57:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now me too. I'll have another one. Let me, uh, sorry here.

1:57:05 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Now bear with me here a second. I'm just looking. I wrote a post. I need to gather these in one place.  Uh, let me see. Can I find something? Hold on one second now. Oh yeah, here we go. I'll show you this in a moment, but I wrote a post and again, my good friend uh, GPT helped.

1:57:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, there's a, I thought it was special. thought I was chat GPT's best friend, so you're telling your best friend as well?  Oh, can't trust that guy.

1:57:43 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So this comes from a little book called The Creativity Leap and the Creativity Leap was written by a friend of mine, Natalie.  Uh, she wrote this little book. Okay. And it's a, this is a really good book. The rest of them I'll kind of show you.  Oh, it's in this book or whatever. This one I recommend. Totally. So Natalie said two things about creativity that I really like and stuck with me.  Shoulda lot, but the two things one is she talks about what she calls the three eyes of creativity. One is being inquisitive.  Two is, if you're inquisitive, be willing to improvise. And then three is the more you are inquisitive, the more you improvise, the better your gut instinct becomes.  You do this because you're creative. So those things come naturally. But I really liked her calling them out. then the other thing she does is when you want to bring creativity into the workplace, she created this little two by two.  And it's called the wonder rigor matrix rigor matrix.

1:58:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:59:00 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And so she says, okay, and there's four parts to this. So you have the y-axis is wonder and certainty, and the x-axis is rigor and freedom.  And so what she does is what's happening in each sector. So if you are in the space between wonder and freedom, where you're free to just explore, then she said, in a business context, that is about provoking what's there.  It's about taking people to see what's there. When you need to think expansively and blow up the status quo, that is what's happening there.  And then she said, but when you're between freedom and certainty, where people need a little bit more certainty, then she said, you're hacking.  This is when you need to rely on your current knowledge to try find new methods that fit their needs quickly and then she said between that's a great definition for hacking yeah so this is what is based on what you have at hand yeah then which is a big part of this and she talks about regeneration and you know all that in there and then she talks about between certainty and rigor that is the way you specialize okay so you need to do a deep dive refine details and do not need or want to take any risks so hold on to that thought for a second and then between wonder and rigor this is where you when you are ready to be a thought leader and a market leader so here's my here's my thought we live all over this chart but what business wants is this corner between certainty and rigor and  I was just trying to see if I can dig something up quickly. I might, but anyway, what I've done is I have taken, I took her, this is where ChatGPT helped me out.  This is called an access value matrix. So it's not just a simple two by two, right? So I put this into a ChefGPT and then I put my own work against it.

2:01:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So an access value matrix is not a two by two.

2:01:31 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So the shape of it is a two by two, but the name of this particular way of using it is an access value matrix.  And I just want to see if I can bear with me here. I've heard, it's very cool. It's cool because what it allows you to do is express opposing ideas as part of one system.  So I just wanted to see quickly if I could show you something, I'll bear with me. second. Yes, here we go, here we go, here we go.  So I work with a little small innovation company. And they're very close to me, they put innovation and coaching together.  And then So I took Natalie's Wonder Rigor paradigm and I tied it to emergent innovation. Okay, and so this was, it's not as, not as crisp as hers, but I basically said the four parts of us were, you know, momentum and precision, curiosity and clarity.  And so what we were doing here was trying to discover and then iterate and then execute and accelerate, right, or whichever way you want to go.  But the point was how do we tie coaching to innovation and so I overlaid their coaching plan and put it over the same parts.  Does that make sense? Okay, let me work with it.

2:03:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's a problem, potential learning. Can you go up here?

2:03:20 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  So it's an N, right? Oh yeah, you go. Okay, I have never even thought of that. Yeah, it's like a backward then.

2:03:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like that as you move through the to the matrix and different things are more valid than other things this connects to different phases of the project right so you can think of like we are now in the phase that this is more important and these are the things so that's how what I thought when you showed this.

2:03:54 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Absolutely and that's how and so the point is and again this is Thinking live here for myself maybe as well as it's not that we are putting up different things It's actually they're all relevant to the system, but where are where are you in the system?  Yeah, yeah, and so what I like about that is that is a way to visualize How this all comes together so in other words maybe and again thinking out loud Maybe when you show me or we talk you're you're you're provoking me And I have the ability to go hack now Mm-hmm.

2:04:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm.

2:04:35 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And in fact invent new approaches and when they go at scale, that's great. We can specialize them Hmm But for it to be authentically you You have all the parts you have all the parts You  And I don't know why this even matters. Maybe it doesn't, maybe it's just fine.

2:05:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  he showed me?

2:05:08 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  But it is?

2:05:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no. matters because this came up in the context of, you know, finding ways to accept one's creativity and express it regardless of how some people might take it.  But this also depends, course, in which mode we are, which mode they are, mode we want to be, which mode we want them to be.  So it made a lot of sense, yeah, for sure.

2:05:41 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  And that note.

2:05:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Okay, so. This was fun. Thank you. No, thank you. I have like 12 books. Sorry. of all the books.

2:06:01 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  I'm just a book person. That's the only one I would say. And you will recognize everything in here anyway.

2:06:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know exactly what's next step, or if there is one specifically, but I feel like there's some venturing out to do and regrouping.  Does it feel like that to you?

2:06:28 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Yeah, I like your venturing out. don't know if you get out of the house much. So I'm learning I get out more, get out more.  Even if those conversations aren't paying, just get out more. Because I spent a week at a conference and it was brilliant.  was brilliant. Yeah, for sure.

2:06:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was at an event these past few days as working on the drawing stuff, and it's a different thing for sure.  It's a different bandwidth and for sure. I'm thinking about on that note so I have an idea I've been talking about this with other people maybe have like chats with three or four people you know not necessarily the big agenda just you know introducing people to each other because we have three years to make friends online so that there's that yeah I would love to do that to set up a meeting like this and like we just pick someone and see if they can do it I have three three people on my on my end came to mind straight away and I'll send you their LinkedIn profile and you can let me know who's interested okay okay but yeah I'm up for that I'm traveling for the next two weeks so it would have to be end of April now this is good it's good to have that this buffer also to process and the things  but yeah this was fun it was it was thank you thank you so much this is really good I appreciate that no likewise I feel I feel like that and I'm chatting to you that you're sitting in this museum of wonderful toys that I can't let's let's do it okay so I got you've planted a triplex on my mind that's I love it my son soccer coach is from Sao Paulo so yeah I think I think I mentioned yeah we get a sense of the Brazilian sense of humor when the jokes are so good they were completely different from the Portuguese ones but I like them it's a different kind of humor okay so John yeah let's let's keep these open let's not schedule anything right now but perfect this was really good I have  other things in my mind right now. Thank you for that. thank you for listening so well. No, 100% likewise 100% likewise.

2:09:08 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Draw, have a good weekend. I'll talk to you soon. Talk to you soon.

2:09:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have a nice one. You too.

2:09:12 - John Morley (johnmorley.co)
  Bye. Bye.
