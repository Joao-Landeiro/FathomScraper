0:00 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Zan, good to see you! Likewise, likewise, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

0:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I told you, I really like your newsletter. It's very elegant. It's a way with words and the taste shines through.  it's good to get it.

0:20 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  I'm glad to hear that from you. And I also had a look at some of your content. I found it from your domain name.  And yeah, I mean, you're also a very good writer. Thank you.

0:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I appreciate that. Where do you live?

0:38 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Where are you based?

0:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm in Brazil. am Portuguese, but I live in Brazil.

0:43 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  You are in Spain, right? Correct. In Barcelona. Yeah.

0:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think Barcelona was the first big city I fell in love with. At some point, there was a possibility that instead of coming to work in Brazil, I would go to Barcelona.  it's funny because my life with it, they can... Completely different direction.

1:02 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  I know those different names. Yeah, you're from Turkey, right? Correct. From the name, yes.

1:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Have you been in Barcelona for a long time?

1:13 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Well, now it's probably four years, but before that I was in Madrid. So in total, seven, eight years in Spain.  Okay. So I'm becoming kind of half Spanish. Spain is a good place to live. like Spain. No, I think, I mean, I imagine Brazil would be the same.

1:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's different. I've here for 12 years already. I like it. I've married here. I keep coming back. But, yeah, Spain, it's closer to family as well, because my family is in Portugal.

1:52 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  So I guess you travel back from time to time. Yeah, yeah.

1:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We are are managing managing to... to... Do that because I work for myself. My wife also works for herself.  We have some flexibility in that regard. And I've become an uncle, so I'm trying to be more present now.

2:12 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Congratulations. And where Portugal? Where are you from?

2:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Near Porto.

2:18 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Porto is a nice city. Yeah.

2:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's funny because it wasn't famous some years ago, and now I think a lot of people have visited Porto.  And when I mention it, people tend to have some nice reactions.

2:35 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Yeah. In the past, it's like, yeah, sure, whatever.

2:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've never visited Turkey, so that's on the list. It's also a big visit to make, right? There's so many things to see.  Right.

2:48 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  It's a big country. Also, Istanbul is a big city, so it also requires some time. Yeah. But no, if you plan to visit, just let me know.  I will. I would have some such. Yeah, yeah, I'll take them, I'll take them.

3:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so, I just want to make the most of your time, and if we get to talk some other time, perfect, but just to, you know, no bait and switch here.  So, let me give you a little bit of context. You've seen my content, so you see that I do the workshop thing.  And one of the things I've been experimenting with is workshops for very specific purposes. And one of the workshops I've been trying to see if there's an interest in that is to help other professions that also have kind of a strategic kind of work, which, you know, branding strategy is very much like that.  And sometimes they, from conversations with, you know, branding professionals, sometimes it's difficult to answer the ROI question. Like, what am I getting?  When do I get those results? Is it worth to invest this money? And I did some research, and there seems to be this problem, but I'm not a branding expert.  I'm not a branding pro, so I need to know a little bit more of, is it prevalent? How do you deal with this?  What's your opinion on this hard question of what's the ROI of branding?

4:31 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  So it's a good question, and actually I was going to ask you, where does your assumption on the file come from, and you just gave the answer.  I guess you had some conversation with some branding people, and maybe it also goes back to the type of branding that they offer.  Because I don't get that question so often, like ROI, because, you know, the problems I... Talked about is more on the positioning and the strategy side and the people who come to me, to my company, are already aware that the lack of proper positioning or lack of proper branding cause some problems in their businesses.  And solving them would help them solve, basically gain, increase the profits, increase or maybe conversion rates on the specific marketing funnel steps, you know.  So I don't get that ROI question so often, but it might be that it's only in my case, because again, because of the nature of my funnel, you know, they usually come.  They usually contact me through the newsletter, which I talk quite extensively about the problems and actually have. I those problems have some brands, right?  So maybe in that sense, I'm not actually the best person to answer that, I think, because I don't face it a lot.  But of course, if you're a branding professional coming from, let's say, more graphic design background, and yes, more about typography, the, say, visual brand identity, I can see that you would get that question more often.  And yeah, I mean, you would have to somehow tie it to ROI. And I also see that, I mean, it might be tricky sometimes.  But again, in my case, I don't get that question so often.

6:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. It makes a lot of sense what you're saying. Because, true, yeah, branding is such a thing. And also, in a sense, because you...  You share so much about what you do and the problems you solve and how you approach them, you're kind of answering the question preemptively, right?  People, when they come to you, they understand this.

7:09 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Yeah. Correct.

7:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And my interpretation from that is if someone is getting questions about ROI, that's a symptom of something else, right?

7:21 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Could be. Could be. For example, if you're maybe making alt-reach campaigns, you know, I don't. And if you are trying to get clients that way, maybe again, like, maybe you are just actually providing the same service like positioning and that may be visual brand identity.  But if you don't allow actually the prospects to get to know like your ideas and everything, the problems you solve, your solution, then maybe again, even if you provide the same service.  I still actually get the same question because, again, they don't know much, right? Okay, you send an outage campaign.  They say, okay, let's have a chat. But, of course, they also ask about ROI because they don't know much about the problems you solve or your solution.

8:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay, so did you get this question earlier in your career? Did you ever get this question?

8:40 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  I mean, of course, I got some time, but it never became a problem, let's say. It never became a blocker for them to proceed.  Got it. the next steps, let's say. Bye.

9:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now, so this is going to be my last question on this, if people are not asking you the question, there's no point in asking you how you think about answering the question, but you are talking about the problem, so in a sense, you do have a mental model of how these things relate, even if people are not asking you to express them, right?  So, do you have like a quick Ozan's perspective on branding? Like, what's your thesis on branding? Do you have like a nutshell of that?

9:46 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Sure, mean, my thesis is that, especially on the B2B side, right, because we work with B2B companies rather than consumer brands, which is a totally different world.  An hypothesis that logos, design, typography, all these visual elements matter, I don't say that they don't matter, but they come last, they are more tactical, together with some marketing, let's say tactics, right, they come later.  So what I believe is that strategy, which is in the end, in terms of branding positioning, comes first, and in order to develop a proper winning positioning, you have to understand your customers, your competition, and your company, only then you can come up with a, let's say, ideal positioning for your brands, and then the rest, everything becomes easier, right, messaging becomes easy, marketing strategy becomes kind of obvious, and also using that basis, you can also create a distinct visual brand identity.  Because again, you have the basis done right, based on insights, so you can also truly become visually distinct as well.

11:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like the inverted iceberg, right? People see the visual and they think it's all about that. Correct.

11:20 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  It has to have an idea, right? I mean, it's not about just being distinct for the sake of being distinct.  And again, in consumer world, like if you go to a supermarket, packaging comes first, right? Of course, you have some features as well, but the packaging visual comes first because it grabs your attention.  And that comes first. You can start with distinctness there. But in B2B world, course, it's touch points are different.  The nature of the services or products are different. So it has to... And it's an idea.

12:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Makes sense. Makes sense. Perfect. So everything comes from the idea. Right.

12:11 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Even like as an example, just what you are trying to do, right? Again, you are actually trying to figure out the idea.  You are, I guess, trying to, in a way, try to position the service that you are providing, or you would like to develop the new service.  Again, the logo of it, like the colors that you will use, the typography, they matter in the end, but they won't be the, let's say, the deal breaker for your potential clients, and they will come last.  Yeah.

12:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. And this is very intentional. It's so funny because when we talk to, and I know this will sound like, you know, I'm just being, trying to, trying to, to.  Persuade you, but when you talk to people that are doing the same sort of thing, it's game, recognize game very quickly, right?  So my previous approach to this kind of thing was like, oh, I'm going to make a landing page and so on, and I have Figma, Illustrator, InDesign, I can do these things, right?  And I'll get lost in those things, like, oh, but then I'm being challenged to practice what I preach. I'm like, yes, okay, let's test if there's something in this.  And maybe I'm, I think in the end, you notice that, are you familiar with Anna Karenina Principle?

13:44 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  No, I don't anymore. It's one of those things from Twitter.

13:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So apparently the book Anna Karenina starts with a sentence that is something like, I haven't read it. Every happy family is happy in the same way.

13:58 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Oh, yes, I know, I know, I know. Yes.

14:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you see like people, successful people doing the same sort of things, evaluating before jumping in and so on.

14:08 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Yeah.

14:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, I think we look at this in a similar fashion. So yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying to see what's the thesis behind this. And just having this conversation with you and some other experts, I noticed that the more senior people are, there's two things, two patterns that I noticed.  One is that what you said, people don't ask as much because the pre-work was done, right? There's presence, a whole kind of interaction that happens before that.  And the other thing is that if the question comes up, because let's say you're interacting with the clients at the company, they get you, but then they bring the CFO and the CFO doesn't know you.  Right. As a new guide, it is not aware. So the second pattern that I'm noticing is that framing ROI in the language of the audience, so ROI for CFO is one thing, ROI for the CMO is another thing, ROI for the CPO is another thing, so these are the things that I'm observing, and it's fascinating.  It's actually dangerous, because it's a bit of a rabbit hole, and I love to do such stuff.

15:31 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  No, but also like what you said, for example, if your clients have potential layers, for example, not your client, but the clients of your clients, let's say, if they are working with enterprise-level customers, and yeah, for example, they might even have RFPs, right?  It's a totally different one, so probably, in your case, let's say, the... Thank you. The clients of your clients even matter, because if they work with small businesses, or let's say medium-sized businesses, maybe there are not many layers, right?  They can just directly talk with the division maker, and they just get the approval. So while, again, if it's an enterprise, yeah, you have to, it's a big enterprise, you have to go through different layers, maybe CFO, CMO, maybe CEO, or maybe board, you know, you never know.  So then maybe it's actually even more relevant, the ROI team. Of course, you always depend on your main, let's say, champion in that business, because they also have to do some stakeholder management.  And usually if they actually, they believe in the projects, if they gave the okays in their mind. But the rest is usually on them, right?  They handle it internally and it becomes easier for you. Me personally, I also don't want to get into too much into company bureaucracy because, again, I don't want to do stakeholder management on behalf of them, right?  Yeah. So just an idea, like the segment of the clients of your clients might also be relevant in that sense.  But another question, actually. So you were preparing a workshop, right? You were planning to prepare a workshop. Is this workshop for you to deliver or for them to deliver?

17:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very good point. It's for me to deliver. So this is, this is, I have a tendency of overcomplicating things and maybe I'm doing that.

17:52 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  But here's the thing. It's all, I mean, it happens.

17:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All the good conversations are with people that overcomplicate things. Yes. So what I've been noticing is that I have a very strong conviction that, especially the whole AI thing, we need to shape the kind of interactions we have with clients, especially like strategic interactions, right?  And people hear about becoming a trusted advisor and going up market and becoming strategic. And this makes sense. But some of these interactions are a new way of working for many of us.  Like, a lot of people have never seen, like, how a management consultant manages an interaction with a client or, you know, a lot of people have not had experience with this.  And so my thesis is to be strategic, you need to shape the touch points to lend themselves to that.  And workshops are a good sandbox for that because workshops, they have a structure, but they have flexibility and they allow...  To surface how you think, because you ask a question, you get some insight, things like this makes me think of that.  You shape this interaction. So I'm very convinced of that. Now, my market is not looking for workshops because I'm not positioning myself as a learning and development instructor or a vanilla workshop facilitator.  I'm positioning myself as a productizer of expertise via workshops. Which I love, by the way. Thank you. Now, the thing is, a workshop is a word that means very different things for different people.  And sometimes people have been burned by the word workshop because they went to some HR team building cringy thing.  And now they think workshops are awful, right? And what I've noticed is that people usually get the value of what I do when they see me do.  Right. So I should create an experience that my market will have a selfish interest in participating in. And then the Trojan horse is, oh, I like what this guy is doing, right?  See, there's like three, four levels of this. So my idea was like, I think that this whole shaping strategic touch points makes sense for branding folks.  And I'm thinking about what could be an interesting bait for, that would be useful. It cannot be , because if it is , I'm ruining my reputation.  needs to be useful enough that some branding people could join and join for their own self-interest, but come out of it and say, oh, I understand this workshop thing now.  So that's what I've been exploring, actually. Yeah, I don't know. Is this a... Does this make sense to you?

21:01 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  It makes sense, but hold on, I will also just open the community view. You sent and... So the service you're planning to sell that they led to this is...  You will deliver a workshop to them, right? For them to prove ROI.

21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For them, yes, for them to know how to handle ROI questions.

21:41 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Okay. Because when I first read the document, I had the impression that actually what you will deliver is for them to deliver a workshop to their clients to just...  ...pro.ri, right? Or come up with... The metrics to prove the ROI. And another question is, are you planning to focus on ROI in the SaaS process?  Or ROI after the delivery? Because there are two different things, right? Like in the SaaS process, of course, you can receive the question.  And there's also the ROI after the Delivering the project. Like, maybe sometimes they don't ask the question during the SaaS process, but you might still want to sell the ROI or set some metrics.  Got it. in the upcoming six months.

22:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. Very, okay. Nuanced question. So a couple of things. First, you're not the first person that got that impression from my document.  So I think I should make it more clear. Other people have thought the same thing.

22:59 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  And... Thank you.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that's the first thing. The second thing is I was thinking about the outcome of the workshop is the participants, branding people, having a little set of safe, known, familiar ways of answering the major ROI questions that they get, right?  So the outcome in terms of a tangible outcome would be perhaps like the last canvas of the workshop, something that they export as a PDF and they can check later.  If they ask this, I say this, you know, something like that. But so much more about proving ROI in order to close a sale, right?  Less about measuring ROI afterwards. But what you say makes a lot of sense because the more data I collect afterwards, the more confidence I'll have for it.  That's, that's, that's, yeah, yeah.

24:04 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Okay, and so the original thing that you do is actually, again, designing, like turning expertise into products and workshops, right?  Correct, yeah. And you plan this as a Trojan horse offer to get to the road? Yes. Okay. And what were the other options that you had in mind this Trojan horse offer?

24:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have none as developed as this one, but there's a few things I... I'll not... They are not very clear.  So basically, when I started, when I started... I was like, oh, I want to serve consultants. And then I've noticed that consultants, especially solos, are a tough market.  They don't buy anything. And then I was like, okay, now I need to serve maybe consulting businesses. And I was having some trouble finding them.  I think it was a matter of skill, outreach, or basically prospecting. I was not very good at prospecting. And I said, you know, I'm finding a lot of agencies.  I have more access to agencies, so I'll start talking to agencies. Agencies is also a huge universe. It's all sorts of agencies, right?  And within agencies, by talking to people, I started to understand this is about faith traffic, not a workshop thing.  And then I'm like, okay, maybe the branding agencies, there's something here, some creative, something that is less mathematical, less about efficiency.  There's taste, you know. And I was like, okay, let's move into this. And my... Most recent foray into that was like, OK, the branding fault, because I got some signals that people are creative, they're very good at synthesis, they're very good at making sense for others, but sometimes they struggle to talk about their own value.  And that's how I came to this. So I don't have any other options I'm testing right now.

26:25 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  OK, so you've been actually kind of digging deeper step by step and trying to find like the ideal client profile and in the process, of course, you were also at least ideating some possible Trojan horse offers, but this is like kind of the main one.  This is the one I've been more the most disciplined about.

26:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, and how has been the feedback from the others? Um, varied, but let me give you a more useful answer.  Um, the tension I feel right now is I haven't been able to find a problem that seems to have such a gravitational pull that aggregates enough people around it to make it worth to run like, um, uh, like a recurring free event webinar sort of thing as a client acquisition that is that I find that have that sort of gravitational pull are, I guess, by definition, quite, um, commoditized, like, Oh, create.  Your first offer, or figure out your first course, you know, things like this. And you don't want to go there, I guess.  Come again?

28:11 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  And I guess you don't want to go into those directions, because, again, they are accommodating.

28:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, and yes, that's a really attention I feel, and that's something I like about your newsletter, because I know you write to a lot of people, but it doesn't come across, it comes across as exclusive.  don't know. There's something in the tone of, are you right? And I like that, because the principle of game, recognized game, that I mentioned before, I really believe in this.  And I'm like, if I start putting out workshops on how to create your offer, I feel that this cheapens the thing.  That's how I think about this. So that's the tension I feel, which is like, I need, I'm trying to look for something.  It makes people pay attention at an enough scale that it's worth to productize as a Trojan Horse acquisition channel, but it's not so vanilla that, you know, just gets lost in the noise and then I need to use very B2C, high visibility, high audience tactics, you know.  So that's been my challenge. I see.

29:26 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  No, I mean, I think you already have the, let's say, I think you are taking the right direction, you know.  You are trying to find a problem that's urgent and important for certain people. So I think that's the right direction.  I don't know if it's this one, know, this are writing for branding agencies, just honest feedback. Thank you. Thank Thank you.  you. you. Thank Thank But, I mean, I found what you, when I went to your website, what you had there actually more interesting, like, yeah, turning expertise into workshops and productizing it.  I totally understand what you say about, yeah, create your first offer. It's like, you know, you don't want to be associated with those people, and I totally agree with you.  Like, there are also certain words that I don't use, for example, like lead generation, you know, because I don't want to be associated with those people, you know, hey, generate leads, blah, blah.  I don't want to be seen as related to those type of people or being, and again, nothing wrong with those people either, but it's just that I don't want do that.  Right. And I also respect what you said in that sense. So, you said, yes, solo consultants, maybe they're not.  But maybe consultancy firms have more complex expertise, you know, rather than agencies, and maybe actually they might be an ideal fit for what you initially said about this, yeah, productizing the expertise through workshops.  Because, again, like especially branding, I mean, maybe it's a bit strange for me to say this, but depending on how you do it, you could also just do it on a basic level, like create a workshop, let's say format, and it wouldn't be so deep, but you will think that you actually have a workshop, you know, you got that coverage, even though it's not that deep, it's not that unique, it doesn't provide that much value, but you and just put some questions, and yeah, you have a whiteboard, and  You have your workshop, at least in your mind, you know, maybe for consultancy firms who, for example, imagine a consultancy firm who work in cloud space and, yeah, they have very complex, actually, personal expertise and also, like, complex discussions, you know, maybe actually they cannot even, like, simplify all those things into a workshop format.  And because it's so complex, right? They wouldn't even know how to simplify it. And you, in that sense, because when I first, again, saw it, I immediately thought about something like that, like, complex expertise, and you're always simplifying that into a workshop format and more productizing it.  So maybe there's something there, but again, I mean, it's just a feedback from what I saw, so take it.  I really appreciate it. I really appreciate it.

33:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so I've been talking to as many people as I can on all dimensions of what I do, right?  And other people have mentioned the consultants as, okay, maybe you need to do more work to find them, but they have more relevant problems.  And the way you framed this, in my understanding, was also very clear, like, the stakes are higher, right?

33:47 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Exactly.

33:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But making mistakes is very costly. Exactly.

33:52 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Or time-consuming, you know? Because if you cannot simplify it, like, it might take actually months to get to some outcomes.  And most consultants don't charge per hour anymore, you know, if you're not McKinsey, so they have value-based pricing or, let's say, project-based pricing.  So, like, it's not that they want to work longer hours and charge Marina. You they want to actually just get in, do the job, get the outcome, and get out, or, let's say, stick longer with a different scope.

34:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. This is good, this is good stuff. Good, good. You gave me some stuff to think about.  I really appreciate it.

34:48 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  I... That was the purpose, and I got it. Exactly. I'm glad, I'm glad.

34:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Ozan, I really appreciate this. mean, it gave me a lot of extra time. I'm very thankful for it.  And now, I'm at stage.

35:06 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  I always leave some margin after my meetings, you know, I don't expect them one after the other, because I know this happens quite often, especially with my questions and comments, feedback, also with the crowd, so don't worry.  Yeah.

35:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, this is good stuff. I might ask you some other questions in the mail. Do you mind if I send you some questions every now and then?  No pressure to answer.

35:37 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  No problem. Sure, sure.

35:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I think even if this went over the time, like in a very short amount of time, you were very precise in your comments.  So this tells me something about the way you think, and it's good to be able to interact. And also, I would like to...

35:56 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  That's kind of what I do, you know? Yeah. For this. It's kind of your thing. Yeah, exactly.

36:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but also, like, I don't want to be a vampire on this. So if there's anything, any questions or anything that you've been thinking about workshops that, I mean, I'm not trying to sell you anything, just trying to be helpful and retribute a favor, I would really like to be able to do that.  So even if you don't have them now, if they come up later, if you have a question or something.

36:28 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  No, of course. It will be a No, I might also send you some selfish questions to get your feedback on certain stuff, you know?

36:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do that, do that.

  But again, I love, I mean, I believe in workshops, joaol, and I spent a lot of time trying to perfect them, and they are still not perfect.  But again, I spent a lot of time thinking, effort, and I'm still improving, of course. Like, each client is a new, like, learning, right?  You learn. soon. And so then you try to improve. And I believe in workshop format. And yeah, again, with the AI thing ongoing, actually like facilitation, I also agree with what you said, like facilitation and this strategic thinking and even alignment, right?  Because five people can all talk to AI and depending on what they think, depending on how they talk, they will get different answers.  And alignment will be a challenge in the future. It's still a challenge, but it will be even, it will be a bigger challenge because I was also thinking like that.  mean, because you can also talk to AI today and get some answers about your position, right? About your brand strategy.  Like what will make me different in the future? And that kind of comforts me. It is a little. So yeah, because again, this alignments.  And also like of. The depth of, let's say, the discussions coming from workshops, and expert facilitators, I think, matters, and it will matter even more in the future.  So I believe in workshops, and I think you're onto something, Osho, just keep going, and I think it will be something very useful.  Thank you, thank you.

38:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's very kind, and I really appreciate it. That point you said about AI saying different things to different people, that's really brilliant, because we now don't even have, nobody watches the same TV shows, right?

38:41 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  Right, right. It's everything that's personalized. Exactly.

38:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we don't have a shared common culture, and AI is accelerating this.

38:50 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
  That's a fantastic point. To an X team. Yes.

38:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a very cool point. Well, this is perfect. Much more than... I could ask for it. really, really liked it.  Thank you for taking the time.

39:04 - Ozan Irturk (Frontera)
