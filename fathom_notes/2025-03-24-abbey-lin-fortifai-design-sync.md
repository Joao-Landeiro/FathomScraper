0:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think there was some, what would you prefer to discuss for this daily app?

0:12 - A L
  Yeah, I think we should discuss the integrity, just to make sure we have that. And then also ideally for this week, we'll have kind of the new design for the update of the entry part of the page.  Like giving the upload function and like kind of the selection of the documents and that. So just to make sure that we have those deliverables covered for the week.

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just a second. Yes. We're just talking about today to discuss both the integrity hub and the new. a kind of mini onboarding into the policy, communication, and trainings based on feedback from pilot users.  When they arrive at the pilot policies, communications, and testing, when they see all of those options, I sometimes get a little bit overwhelmed.  Hello, Ivan. Hello. Hi, Hello. So I think, so Ivan, very quickly for today, we're thinking about discussing Integrity Hub as is designed, and also the new entry point into policies, communications, and trainings based on feedback.  OK. So I think starting with the one that will probably take the most time, it's not Integrity Hub, is the entry point into policies, communications, and trainings.  is very clear. The use case is very clear. People, new users arriving at those sections, they don't feel at ease or they feel overwhelmed with how many options they have, right?  that correct? Oh, sorry.

2:14 - A L
  And to add that is that the ones who have experience don't want to see all of those there because they already know what they want to pick.  Okay.

2:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's either they are overwhelmed or they're not overwhelmed, they're just not interested, right?

2:26 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

2:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So the idea, maybe we can open this thing in the tab. But my thinking on this is this.  Making that selection of what matters to them seems to be we can do kind of a faster version, but also this seems to be something that is very central to the experience, right?  It relates to the onboarding and how people will use the platforms, the platform, does this vibe with you guys, do you agree with this?

3:10 - A L
  Yeah, I think there's kind of a longer term and a shorter kind of term thing that we need to do with because I've been reading more about BSME over the weekend and kind of looking at what it means for our platform and I think that I think policy procedures and trainings will be safe, I think some of controls will be safe but I think we need to almost have just like a short-term thing is like how do we make the onboarding just on the policy part when they enter that page look okay because I think the overall platform might need to change like I think we might not need risk management section anymore actually so yeah I think there's like a short-term thing of just cleaning it up as is so that we have like kind of the the platform like working or like as we kind of test the other different things then like a longer kind of onboarding discussion might need to change depending on how we change the platform.  Got it.

4:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So on the very V1 kind of thing, this would be just before people see all of these things they select what they want and what they don't want, right?

4:10 - A L
  Yeah, or they can add a new policy using a PDF. I think that was like a feedback from two or three of them that either like in the first section is like select the policies you want or upload the policies you want to deploy kind of thing.  So we might not need like an ESG on top. We only need like one deployment. I don't know, we have to think about how you want to do that.  So ideally maybe you come to our front page first and then you have the ESG there and there's like check marks on which ones you want and then you can upload and then the next page suddenly they're all populated.  I'm not sure and that could also be overwhelming because I know you're at one page that has everything on it.  But yeah, yeah, so that's that's

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's my question mark around this change. Because if we make it really quickly without figuring out how it connects, we are pretty much bound to have to redo it in a minute.

5:17 - A L
  But if we look at Sprinto, I don't know, Yvonne, are you able to see Sprinto? Because they just have all the documents.  It's not like anything . It's like they just have all the documents listed in the page.

5:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's always just the list, like Fenty or something. I can show you if you want.

5:35 - A L
  But that is for the integrity, No, it's for the, but Sprinto also has a policies, procedures, and trainings sign off thing, too.  Yeah.

5:48 - Ivan Ćelić
  But that's not maybe some of the best UIQIs. That's just how they have it. I can show you. So we are all on board with this year.  So they have it like this, I think they actually updated the UI update, but yeah, they did update it a little bit actually, but it's a list basically, yeah.  Are you sharing? Okay. Yeah, he's there. And everything that's related to Fortify in this case, it's in here. And actually, I don't know what's with the policy that are not applicable.  So that's that's, I don't know. And they here have some kind of updates available that's interesting, but that's not relevant right now.  I'm not sure if we even have some inactive documents. think we just have everything set up.

6:35 - A L
  I think we have everything it might be like we need these are the ones you need to pass like the things that they just gave us like this, the minimum you have to do.  And this is also the thing it's like we should also like. And depending on the module right if they're only doing e they should only see the e policies if they're only doing s they should only do policies and the gg policy so maybe it won't be so bad.  How do we know if they're.

7:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're only doing ES or G-policies. I think right now for the pilot, it's just like they get all of them.

7:05 - A L
  But I really do when they sign up and they pay, then they get one or the other. But again, we're going to probably have to change the tool anyway.  yes. Oh, wow. Look, they have AI in this now, Ivan. Oh, they're actually changing it like we wanted to, too.  Before it was just the template. Now they put AI into this, just like how we had planned it. You can see here they're suggesting some kind of changes.

7:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, interesting.

7:34 - A L
  So they have added, yeah.

7:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  But I don't know.

7:40 - A L
  Is there like, no, we're going to have to redo it, Zhao. it's a given. And it sucks. And it's not the most efficient thing at the time.  But the point is, is also when I do customer service things, like calls, they also seem a little bit overwhelming.  like, oh, we don't need to do this or whatever. So it's like, I would say it's like, yeah, it's hack.  like it's a short-term thing that helps relieve a little bit of the pressure while we have to redesign the whole tool.

8:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And what would be a view one of that just speak the policies that you want?

8:11 - A L
  Yeah, I guess I don't know like a list just like maybe one front page like you know that comes in so everything else eat that page that we have right now has nothing on it right like it's blank right and then there's one page before that says like select and then even you need to think about this technically like ideally one that would just select.

8:30 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would say but the problem I think there is what if you don't know which policies are which because by the name you need to actually take a look at the policy content right sometimes or do you know it by name?

8:44 - A L
  Well you also have like yeah like maybe you have the view right now maybe it just goes to the deploy and the deploy goes into a thing.

8:52 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can have like we can have a quick action on policies maybe that can help or something like that just an idea.  I'm throwing out now so we can have a maybe quick action on each of these rows that you see right now which could maybe say uh mark is not applicable or something and then it hides because currently we are not showing not applicable one so we already are filtering the problem right now is that once you come in first time everything is shown that's the problem let's say so in theory they need to go into each each one and mark is not applicable maybe that's not the easiest flow for all of them but in theory we already support that it's just a question of how we want to present it right now to the users if you want to have it like once your first time arrived then we open your list maybe quick action or something I don't know maybe we can have a quick action button right next to the status here that says mark is not applicable and what I don't know something like that I guess I don't really know what's best here I mean we I know but basically the point I'm trying to get at is  We have implemented the flow, we can hide from the UI the policies that are not applicable, we're already doing that.

10:06 - A L
  Sorry, have a question of the... Hello.

10:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  But yeah, basically just to conclude, I think it's just now a question of what the easiest way to help users once they first come in, not we overwhelm with bunch of likely policies and stuff.  So how to make them do this easier. But on the other side, you cannot just show a list of titles.  I think they need to be able to see what's inside of each policy, because sometimes what does EMS manual into you in your company, maybe in your company you calling that the ABC manual and it's the same, who knows.  So actually you would need to go into the EMS manual and see. in theory, I don't think we are too far off from what we need to achieve it, just probably we need to just reorder the UX.  But let's see what's up in return.

11:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So our main point here is that, for sure, yeah, things can be changed. That's not complex. We even have components that we can reuse.  That's not the difficult aspect. The main point is, how can we make it in a way that it builds up?  So we do a V1, but the V2 is not a complete redesign of V1. It's V1 plus 1, Yeah.

11:35 - Ivan Ćelić
  We want to be able to have our onboarding, definitely. And then onboarding should be like, hey, what do you want to do in this app?  And then you say, I want to do EMG, probably, or whatever. I guess. And then we already show you a pre-selected list of something.  We already pre-selected, and then you just confirm it, and that's it. then after that action, we mark. part of the policies is not applicable and then as applicable and we do that for you.  I think that's the flow that we want to achieve but we can maybe have something a bit more simple right now although we can also have that that's not so like if we can draw that up there's four days you know for the rest of the day like you know so maybe there is time to actually draw that up and then we just have that ready and then we decide which part of that do we actually implement to make our pilot tapi versus you know getting new customers and we can also in here we can also save this happens only once for each user or each organization sorry so we can save into the database once you do this action we can save it as done and we don't show you this anymore but you can still mark them as not applicable later on you can still go into the each policy and change it and so on so maybe that can be a flow that we can we can implement what you think okay so from the

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  boarding perspective what I take is that what we're building towards is eventually an onboarding for the for the whole app eventually and we use the information from that onboarding to select things that fit into each section like this doesn't matter this matters you probably want this this but before we get to that stage we begin building the last part of it which is just showing them a quick way of go no go for each of the policies right okay I think that's doable for sure what I think we what we should keep in mind given our track record is this will be imperfect and we should be putting the effort into moving faster on that so we don't get tied up into making sure that the best possible version of this middle ground thing exists the middle ground  I think does not deserve use a huge level of polishing. just should just get it out. And then we keep building up the other sections of the more on-boarding thing.  And I think that that's my main problem. We can design something for this, of course. I think if we a week or two from now we are discussing like the tone of green for that, that's not what should be.

14:29 - Ivan Ćelić
  My question is, then, do we get rid of the ERG filter at the top on these pages?

14:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do users, what kind of feedback are users? They haven't really said that much about it.

14:43 - A L
  I think some, like a lot of the users are like either only doing E, only doing S, only doing G.  And so it could be part of the on-boarding, then they don't see it. But at the same time, I think that it can get overwhelming.  If you do ESG and then suddenly you have all of policies at one plate. But the chances of that are quite slim.  Because I don't think everyone's going to fully implement everything at once. just made kind of gradual. so I think it's fine just to have one and then like put it in and maybe we color code them or like put them in sections.  I don't know. I have a feeling that we might need to change this.

15:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, we can for now we can leave the filter at the top. that's it. The ones that are not relevant to will not be empty and we can even try to disable them or something like that.  That can also be done. So yeah, I think we can maybe do something like that for this. then we can see where we go with this on boarding and how this policies page depends out.  Perfect. Got it.

15:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It feels to me that we have an agreement on what needs to be done here. We might need some discussion on what it actually looks like.  But basically the direction

16:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  desire is is clear I would say I would say that they will so users will need to be able to select ESRG they need to see what's inside of each of these so which policy training which communication I would say this whole flow should be repeated for training for policy community separately that that's a question for Abby if she's here if we need to come if this flow needs to be done for each sorry my senses are all over the place so the question is Abby do we need to repeat this for training policies and communications yes yes so it's separate so I can probably do can I is it possible for me to select for policies for training G and for communications S you could but I think it's gonna overwhelm people like I think it's easier like okay now we're in the policies like if you want to plan for the year yeah maybe but most likely is you're gonna do section by section like you'll go into a box and go okay these are the ones I need to pick no but

17:00 - A L
  I think Ivan's question was different.

17:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I'm talking about ESG categories.

17:05 - Ivan Ćelić
  like top-level, you have ESG. And to me, it doesn't make sense that I, as an organization, will do trainings in E, but I won't do communications in E.  Does it make sense that I need to set up ESG filter for training separately, then for policies, then for They should probably link.

17:22 - A L
  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do that.

17:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I guess this is something that we need to show to the users on the first login. We can even show it to them as they log in first time as their organization.  And then we ask them, what do you want to do? And you say EMG. And then we show you all these policy trainings and communications only for EMG.  Does that make sense?

17:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To me, it makes a lot of sense, but it brings back an important question. Because role-playing this, I think what you're  Ed even correct me if I'm wrong is the situation we're trying to avoid is I'm a new guy using this platform, right?  I open policies for the first time. I've never seen it and I say, oh, yeah The tab is by default on I don't know environmental and I say I want I want to follow these policies The street policies on environmental right and the list gets assembled Then I go about my business and I return to the platform And I oh I need to Select the trainings and then I open the trainings But I made a mistake because people make mistakes all the time And I don't notice that trainings is with on social for instance, and I pick like trainings on social that are not related to environmental, right?  Is this a situation you're trying to avoid? I don't know.

18:45 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't yeah, I don't think you can select social trainings and Yeah, if you only have e you won't see the social trainings.  Yeah, but Okay, where do you define e in that model? discussed it won't be for policies only it will be for everything so basically think of it as some kind of pop-up that happens once your first time as an organization log in anyone from organization updates logs into the app you should probably see a pop-up or a page whatever doesn't matter I agree I agree when you ask yo what do you want to do and then you say I want to do E and then when you select E you can you there somewhere somewhere in there you see the list of training policies communication that are included in that maybe at least something but once you select it that's it then we already pre-filtered for you all of all the all three policy recommendations I fully agree I think that's the way yeah that way it's not just an onboarding inside of the section is an onboarding about everything else that's that's the conclusion yeah definitely it's not onboarding for policies it's onboarding for platforming here for now yeah okay it's a first version of what I would say yeah okay this is an important decision yeah I agree I agree  I mean, are you are you there? Hey, does it make sense? So we will now be creating like an onboarding on the platform where users will select ESNG.  Does it make sense to have that kind of separation if we will pursue some kind of VSME or some kind of things like that?  does ESME have ESNG?

20:49 - A L
  No, but I think we know it doesn't. But I don't think we need to think about that at this point.

21:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  The third tier of our product that goes to bigger companies and then the SME is for smaller ones, okay Yeah, I see yeah, that's how I understood that I read the mail and that's how I understood it also Yes, anything will so we need to offer both actually so whatever we are right now building I don't think we will need to Undo it.  I would say that will still stay more or less relevant for bigger companies and smaller companies will just Do the SME part and be part of our database, but okay Let's a discussion for another meeting basically, okay, but then then I would say that the job I'd say it makes sense.  I think we can all agree abby so that the final thing will be decision is that we are we will create some kind of Onboarding with ERG selector So you when you as organization admin come to the 45 first time login You will be prompted with some kind of screen or something which asks you what do you want to do?  Then you will say I want to do E and G when you select it and save it Then we on the platform.  We are just the training policy and communications from those countries the queries and mark everything else as not applicable and that's it.  You don't have to do it inside of policies, it's something that's not the first time you enter the application and later we can also maybe think about changing that but for now that's the plan.  If that does that make sense to you? Yeah.

22:18 - A L
  Okay. Okay.

22:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is really important so I want to make sure we have the same picture of what the decision we're making.  The decision we are making is let's create an onboarding flow not specifically for policies, communications or trainings but for the whole platform and based on the answers that people give on that platform decisions get suggested to them on policies, communications and trainings and perhaps elsewhere.  So is this are we agreeing on that?

22:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think it makes sense you know I don't think this is that big of a I mean it is important but I  I it makes sense to be honest. So if you as a company want to do just G, will select it and then you really don't care about EMS for now.  So I would say it makes sense. And I don't think that will be a problem with our users. I think it will in line with how they go.  let's see, let's see.

23:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then I think the corn part of this is adding the PDF parts.

23:18 - A L
  Because I'm realizing a lot of the ones that are using this will already have policies. Especially the BSME ones, they might not have policies.  But the bigger ones will have existing ones. So I think it's going to be key that we allow them.  And we have kind of drawing as part of this process for the adding the PDF. And what is it going to look like when they add the PDF?  So I would say those are two different things. we are to give you the first thing. that's fine.

23:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then maybe you can just enter any of these policies. Just click on the view button. And any of these doesn't matter.  Yeah, so this is the current situation where you can edit the text. But what we want to do is here somewhere.  In the UI, we want to add. option to upload a PDF and once you upload the PDF then we just replace this textual view and editor with the PDF view and that's it.

24:12 - A L
  That we show that we have to the user so it's either text or PDF.

24:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  So it's the same thing as trainings right? Yes, yes, yeah.

24:24 - A L
  So we it's done, correct?

24:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry? Yeah, the drawing is it done?

24:32 - A L
  don't think it's done.

24:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For trainings, the way trainings works is that we upload the PDF right?

24:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I don't think there's much to do hearings only to add a button at the top that says upload your own policy or whatever.  Then you upload it and then instead of this text we just show PDF. So I don't think there's much there to do because we just all need to agree on a flow.  I think there's no key here, but I don't think there's much from the But design perspective that will be different.  It will look similar to trainings like you just got it.

25:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK, we'll draft something, but the important parties, sorry, the important parties that once you upload PDF, then you don't have this text role.

25:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  And the end users will be able to see your PDF. So it's either PDF or text because that's, I mean, if you upload your PDF, that means you override your your written text.  Got it.

25:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Understood. So I'm to pop up warning, override current policy. OK, let's draw, not right now, but let's draw up a flow for this because as I understand, right now, we don't know.  If I'm a first-time user and I open the platform, where do I arrive? Is it home?

26:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  We can, yeah, we can put compliance. I think it's compliance map for now, and we can show something either over compliance map, like on-boarding that we discussed, or we can redirect to a separate page and find the both.  So we can do both. It's from the technical side, it's whatever, and you can choose whatever you like more as a UX.  Either redirect to a separate page, when one should complete, we go back here, or just pop up for something over this system.

26:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it. So in terms of on-boarding, basically the on-boarding is a way of collecting information about the kind of use cases people are interested in, right?  And to help them choose what matters the most for the use cases. And this means that we need to have perhaps three questions on a form, right?  So we will need to figure out, and this is a subject matter expert kind of thing. What are the most important things you would ask a person starting to use the platform that would help you prepare the platform for their specific use case, right?  And, yeah, we need to figure that out.

27:17 - Ivan Ćelić
  If we can start simple and just ask, do you want to do ESRG? And over time, I think it will grow with the questions, or with the stuff you said.  But for now, I think the key is just to know their filter. So we can pre-filter, for example. So the first time they are out to policies, they expect to see only what's relevant to them.  So it's E, only E stuff. Got it.

27:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

27:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  The only problem, think that's that part, because once your current system, how it works, it's already pre-filtered. So it's already to see ESRG.  You never see all of them together. So in theory, we didn't solve much of the issue that once user comes in and see everything, they're overwhelmed.  In theory, we didn't solve it that much, right? We can imagine that we just hit on top the categories at the top, the ones that are not relevant to you in theory.  So we need to think about how will the user, and if the current flow is okay, how does user go through the ones they selected, the FOMG?  Let's imagine they selected environment, they go into the policies and they see 10 policies. Is that okay? Is that not available for them?  And is that okay? And that's my question. Because with this onboarding, we did help with filtering, but the UI is already filtered, so you will never see ES and G together on the same page.  So that's something we need to talk about.

28:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. for the V1, this is a very high level question. Are you interested in ES or G or NRG because the person could be interested in many, right?  But for the future, and this is mostly a business decision for the future, I think it's interesting to find...  like packages of users, groups of users, like what kind of company are you? Oh, you're this kind of company, probably on this thing, this thing in this thing, right?  One from social to from governance and one thing from environmental, right? But I understand your point. So yeah, we need to specify this, okay.  It's good enough for stress. I have a question for you.

29:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  So when users, can you remind me, I forgot what exactly were users overwhelmed with, were they overwhelmed with policies list when they came to it, were they overwhelmed with it or with something else?  I think it was, I think one, one was the PDF thing.

29:40 - A L
  Like, I think they were just annoyed because for the ones that didn't know what they were doing that was, the other one, it was just more like, I don't need to do all of these.  And now they're kind of like in my space. And then they were overwhelmed like with them that needed to be done.  Like, like Cognite, it's just like, I have to go through all these documents. and it's like almost like, if it would be better if they just

30:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  of one and then they get it through but then suddenly you throw all of them and they're just like annoying that they had to go through ES and G and do all of them or were there I know that inside of E there were documents that were not relevant to them.  It's more like within each one like like it was more E I would think I've got a pushback I think on some of them because there's not that many in G and like well I already have the G policy but I would like to see the other Yeah that we come to the point I want to make is that we still did not solve that issue because even if you pre-select E only you still get a list of yeah but I think it's more like it's like the ones that they want to work on right like when like there's a period like yes these are all the E's that I could get overwhelmed but I could only select the ones that I want to work on and then they go there so I think that's kind of we also as a part of one morning you would also like to have a selection you will not be only selecting ES and G you will also be selecting once you so first step is select ES or G  It's like e, that's the first step. Then in the same flow, it asks me, these are the e-policies. Please select which one you do.  Yeah, exactly, which one I OK, that's important to know. Yeah, OK.

31:12 - A L
  But in terms of I need to run to another meeting, but I think of an understanding of the integrity hub, it's just that it needs to be really wow, very cool.  And then I think a little bit more fun than what we saw in Vantab, because this is going to be the one thing of kind of like putting up.

  Sorry, I understand the notion of using the integrity hub. Sorry to interrupt, but that part is clear. understand the function of the integrity hub.  But I think we got a little bit confused, because the first time we've made the integrity hub, we went hard on that aspect.  then we were shown the Vantab thing a couple of times. And we assumed it was about information density. We increased the information density, and now it's like Vantab.

31:57 - A L
  Yeah, OK, then we're aligned. I need to run to another meeting with Helen or but um then if we can just I put out like schedule on the timing of this Then that would be good like it will integrity hub be updated today then and then we work on the other ones We don't know what to change integrity hub.  Okay. I don't know integrity hub The problem with the first one is I like the design but the content didn't make any sense It's like here's our carbon figure which we don't have in that So it's like the text that you have in the content design.  It's great But it needs to be like displayed in a more fun way whether it's like I don't know like rolling different things they click through the thing and and that it's just like How do you make that page more fun?  I guess is the is the is the point like the problem with the first one is like The content didn't make sense because we hadn't decided what the controls were right like there was still a fun element of it But like what you're displaying really didn't make sense in the context of what we were doing.  So now we understand what we're doing, which is the controls that are written out. But we need to display that in a more fun way.  Does that kind of make sense? Because I really need to jump off. Otherwise, we can have another call at 5 o'clock in 30 minutes.  Yeah, I guess. Should we have another call in 30 minutes? I can do it, yes. Hello? I can do it.  Hello?

33:24 - Ivan Ćelić

33:28 - Ivan Ćelić
  OK, then, Joe, can you maybe send the same invite or you can extend this one, I don't mind. Did you understand that part about the one that we rushed at the end about having two steps of the onboarding flow?  So it's not only selecting ES and G, it's also selecting inside of whatever you first select. Then we need to also be able to select the correct policies.  Not select, but maybe the word should be discard the ones you don't need. There as I like check boxes or clicking yeah, that is clear.

34:03 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  That is good.

34:04 - Ivan Ćelić
