0:00 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  pretty easy. I had a gap, so happy to do it. I must admit, I was quite taken by your proposition and loved your website as well.  think there's a few of these websites going very simplistic in their design. I think I think it really works, especially in your case.  Tell me about what you do in more detail. Tell me what I wouldn't find out in visiting the website.  How do you work?

0:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, there are search words for me in three. No, just kidding.

0:33 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  So, what would you know from a first-class?

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I went to school for design. I thought I was really fascinated by the more functional aspects of design. I did industrial design engineering and I thought, I don't think I have good enough taste to make it as like a visual designer, but I love this system stuff.  And then I got into the whole design thinking thing a while ago. No one's opinion on it, but I saw first time like the power of doing these sorts of meetings to get people to think together about things come to come to decisions and stuff like that.  Yeah.

1:12 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Awesome. I love that.

1:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:14 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  We've done a lot of. We do a lot of workshop type stuff ourselves. I've gone through some facilitation training with across AJ and smart travels.

1:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

1:25 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  So I bought into their program a while ago that kind of changed my thinking on how we deliver our programs.  I'm more interested in what our clients could could do together with you because I know that they have trouble quite a lot of the time productizing what they do.  Systemizing it and making sure that it is something that is of high value and high perceived value because these guys we work with consultancies as hopefully you know by now.  They're not creative in any way. And I think it is to the detriment of the client experience when it's not a professional.  or looking at, you know, when it's not a smooth flow in terms of when they're working with clients. So as you think we could, this is why I wanted to call, basically, I think we could potentially feed clients your way, I think they can benefit from what you do.  And I think it would benefit our process as well, because we're positioning them. And, you know, if they want to be seen as professionally, if they want to be seen as a premium option that's charging high prices, and, you know, but delivering value, they're going to need the kind of thing that you offer, I think.  So if there are any work that you can share, do you have sort of a portfolio of work that you've done for clients?  And it might be difficult, because in a lot of cases, I guess this is intellectual property for your clients.  So it's difficult to share it. But is there anything in the public domain?

2:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not a lot of visuals. I can talk about case studies. I'm so much better with being transparent and putting on an act.  So you never feel you have the best or the appropriate level of imagery to show your work, right?

3:06 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  feel that way.

3:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, so what would be the ideal thing for you to see? Yeah, open my mirror and show you some of the best work.  That would be great.

3:20 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Yeah, would you mind doing that? Yeah. I'd just be interested to see whatever your comfortable sharing, of course, at this stage.  But I want to get a sense of, because we've got some clients who are already using products like Miro, Mural, we use Lucid Spark.  And I think a lot of them are recognizing that there's big opportunities there to better facilitate and to obviously make more scalable because otherwise a lot of these guys are just working still quite analog in the room still.  And I think they're missing out on the scaling opportunity really, especially opening up new geographies working remotely. So, yeah.

3:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm just opening a few different boards here. Okay. And you'll see like the actual mess. So I'll begin by sharing one that's more of my own stuff.  A little product I did a while ago just to help consultants and coaches start posting content. But then I realized that I don't want to be in that thing.  I'm not proficient enough at that. But the point was introspective or maybe shy. That kind of very self-critical kind of a profile.  So this is in Portuguese. I might have an English version somewhere. And it was, it happened on two sessions, right?  And the basic idea was that you lay down a little bit of the rules of engagement. I don't know if you speak Spanish.  If you speak Spanish, maybe this kind of means a bell. I did take Portuguese classes when I worked for a client.

5:00 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  It's so when I when I say this to you, this is the only phrase I can remember and it will it will demonstrate how long ago it was and it will become very obvious very quickly.  You tend to think they're doing something that.

5:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'm not. So the idea here is that I lay down some like rules of engagement. I give them a little bit of a.  Tutorial just write your name here if they can do that they can use the post-its can be easy always make it very clear how much time they have for exercises and just trying to keep people on track and you know feeling comfortable just going through the process.  And then because this was about you know content about their own expertise, I wanted to anchor that into their actual experiences, not just desires.  So things they studied like formally. through this and we asked them, I didn't know I was doing that at the time, but this was about creating kind of your own POV perspective, which is such a common theme around authority marketing and so on, right?  And I asked them, what's more important to you? There's four options on purpose, so nobody would say stuff in the middle, you need to make a choice.  Yeah, just to give an example of the kind of the dilemma here is, for instance, depend only on myself or rely only on myself or bring others along or, for instance, I want to be respected by experts or I want everybody to accept me and all of these questions, they add a little bit of attention for people to reflect on it.  And then we try to map a little bit of what's difficult for them, like, oh, I don't have enough time to create content, I'm afraid that people will judge me.  I don't know how to make beautiful posts, stuff like that, they would just, you know, vote. Yeah, they would fill it up and then vote and then a little bit of feedback.  Oh, this was good This was a bit of a shame. What about to try this this thing, right? And that suggested some feedback feedback topics for them.  Oh, tell me about the timing them about my facilitation tell Tell me about What you got out of this stuff like that.  Yeah, awesome Yeah, there's a session there's a second session and if you want to get into going to it, but Maybe that's fine.

8:29 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  I'm more interested in in your process. So when you do this for clients, how do you first establish? I'm guessing there's a discovery phase where you need to sort of download everything from the client in terms so that you can build their framework.  How does that whole process work?

8:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Yeah, generally I've been trying to to get more to transfer this kind of expertise into a more explicit field  But basically, there's these steps, right? The main one is, I don't know if I'm answering your question. I'll try.  So the main one is we list what we've done in the past. a zone of excellence, so to say.  And we try to figure out what people really like about their work. And based on that, we come up with some different options.  We can have a decision matrix for that. This is a very internal document. I'm showing you. So it's not beautiful.  It's like my own notes on it.

9:34 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  So we have a decision matrix to help them choose.

9:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  oh, this would make a better workshop than this thing because this is shorter. For me, as an expert, it's less exciting.  But I'm sure this will connect faster with somebody that has never worked with me so that this would win, right?  Yeah. So and then you decide what thing do you want to convert into a workshop, what aspect of real work you want to convert into a workshop, you slice it up, I think there's three stages to this, like stuff that happens before the workshop, like an intake form or assessment or something like that, and stuff that happens after the workshop, like you send them next steps, follow up, like a bit more of a detailed take on the conclusions they reach during the workshop, that kind of thing.  And then I assemble it based on questions. For me, the backbone of a workshop is a series of questions you want to answer.  And some of those questions are best answered by VIA with certain kind of activities, or other questions are best answered with other kinds of activities.  But that's kind of the fundamental unit of the workshop for me, what kind of questions do I want to answer through this?  that I start putting together different activities that allow me to do these sort of things and trying to connect activities to the next one.  So it starts just to summarize. It starts with actual experience that they have. I try to step away from, wish I really want to do like a workshop on AI.  Have you ever done a workshop on AI? No. Do you know anything about AI? No. So I So that's the first tenet of it.  Yeah. Yeah.

11:35 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Highlight.

11:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry for the rambling on. No, no, no, it's good.

11:40 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  It's good to get a sense of your process. as I say, we work with big consultancies mostly. have the kind of advisory services that you talk about on your mesozoic side.  I think, yeah, as I say, some of them are using Tools like mirror mirror or others are yet to really sort of productise what they're doing in this way They haven't got the frameworks.  They could certainly do with the help. I want to I want to make sure that it's beneficial You I mean first off is that the kind of client that you that you feel you can help?  I'm sure it is. Yes And presumably you've got plans internationally It's not that you know location isn't a isn't an issue for you because again You're installing the virtues of exactly, you know, what you do, so I'm guessing that's not an issue Talk to me about the commercials if you but I mean first off how long are you typically working with a client?  Let's say that you they're coming to you with their first needs. So you produce their first It's kind of scalable product eyes offering.  How long do you typically working with them to do that?

12:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm So I'm going through the process basically I try to stay within six weeks, okay? And I try to keep it to four calls, like four 90-minute calls.  But sometimes it needs a little bit more time, know, how it goes. And you do work behind the scenes in terms of creating frameworks and everything.

13:16 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  So it is a full service kind of offering, really, from you. Yeah, it's turnkey.

13:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It needs to be created because I cannot create your own frameworks, but I can shape them and make them, you know, portable.

13:29 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Perfect. And then, so lastly, what's the, yeah, what are the commercials on it? Do you have sort of packages or is there a fixed price for this?  What sort of budget should my clients be looking at if they're going to work with you?

13:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So right now, there's two things I do. One is the more about creating visual frameworks. And the other one is more about workshop formats.  So both of them are around. $2,000 each. Okay. And I do think that I need to work on this, but it's what it is at this point.

14:08 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  And yeah, and that's it.

14:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then sometimes, sometimes if a client is very creative, this process doesn't work because they have a lot of ideas with what they need is more like creative coaching, like holding back.  But that's, I haven't been able to really put a fence around that. So it's, it happens, but it's not really something that I have productise myself.  Okay.

14:35 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  All right. That's good to know. Listen, I think there's a, there's a couple of opportunities here that I think are presenting themselves.  Apologies for my camera, by the way. I think it's strobing.

14:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I've got a new laptop and I can't work out how to Probably the lights. Yeah, it could be.

14:49 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Yeah. It's in any case. I think first off, the very easy one is we've got similar clients. think there's an opportunity for us to reverse, uh, clients each way.  We've got a referral option in terms of within our business we give a 10% commission to anybody that refers somebody who becomes a client and buys into one of our programs.  Typically the way that we're doing that with international clients is there's really only two options, 10% of that equates to trying to do a conversion into USD and imagine it's in the region of $600 to $950 or something in that region for every client that you refer our way.

15:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Something in that region.

15:35 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  The other opportunity I see is that potentially we could essentially sell your offering as part of, you know, if we were to package it up, essentially advertise it, talk to our clients about it and send clients to you, essentially to do the delivery.  But I think in the short term it makes sense possibly through just a simple referral process and just It's something in place there.  Are you open to that sort of partnership?

16:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yes, especially the this this first stage that you've mentioned that I also feel that there's some ducks that need to put be put into a certain row.

16:18 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  So, so yeah, I have a client I have a client based in in the US in Colorado who I think might be a good fit for you.  She is in massively in creation mode. She's gone through the process of positioning with us. She's put just putting together, building a diagnostic that she's using to assess clients and get them to essentially benchmark themselves.  I think the next stage for her might be to take a look at how her product is packaged up, how she's delivering it and she makes it more scalable.  So I might have an introduction for you straight away. And actually, I've got a good relationship. I'd like to get her feedback when she speaks with you to comment on.  on your sales process and the experience of coming to you as a potential client as well. So I think that could work quite well.  I'll have a word with her. name's Lisa Ari. Let me just grab, just so you can take a look.  I'll grab her website for you so that, you know, if this does turn into anything you know who we're speaking about.

17:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll pop this in the chat.

17:28 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  There you go. Lisa's an absolute delight to work with. She's been a fantastic client. She's given us a brilliant testimonial as well and she would be an absolute joy to work with for you as well.  So she works in the leadership space essentially and we've been helping to, you know, per game when it comes to the language and how she's positioned.  So, yeah, I think that might be a good sort of test of the water. But let me have a think about how else we might...  be able to collaborate. I think the underlying fact is that we've got very similar clients, I think we've got complementary offering, there's no real crossover in what we do and so I think in prospects it's perfect sort of a partnership and I'm open to any sort of ideas or aspects of this that we want to put my way for consideration.  I think it was just, you know, great to connect in the first instance and just explore the opportunity. Yeah, absolutely.

18:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you for doing that. I was just talking to somebody the other day and they asked me, do you know Matt?  And I think I got like your message on that day because Daniel, the new primer.

18:38 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Oh, okay. Oh, yes. Yeah. And no, I love this.

18:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I also feel that, I mean, there's much, much to learn in the process. And also if there's and I'm also open to  I don't know, maybe I'm trying to put together like a podcast or like eight episodes around Creating products from expertise Okay Yeah, and I'm I'm using the word products on purpose because I think offer is a different beast that yeah It is really my jam.  Yeah, or it's like I'm more a product a guy than a marketing guy And I think offers it will lean more towards marketing.

19:24 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Yeah, well, I think in this space show I think you are you're quite unique. haven't seen I Haven't gone looking for it, but I haven't seen anybody really operating in this productization space in the advisory Sector, I think you've got I think you've got a good a good position for this I think this being your expertise.  I think you'll be in demand when people, you know start to Get to know you and that you're in the market I don't think there's anybody really doing this and it's surprising because you know I've been aware of the whole sort of design thinking and see you know near a mirror  or the Lucid Spark Sonic sort of tech stack and all of this side of things. But I think a lot of consultancies haven't found their way to this yet and haven't been thinking productization.  They've just been thinking very traditionally about solutions and services. So I think once people start to know about you, I think you're going to be in demand.

20:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you. It's interesting that it's really, yeah, it is warming up. sometimes you can point exactly at the thing that moved the needle.  Sometimes you cannot. But yeah, it's very reassuring to see that the signal is increasing because I know better how to talk about this thing.  it's... Yeah, awesome.

20:42 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Great. OK, yeah, for now, let's leave it there, but it was great to connect with you. think there's a lot in prospect that we can do together.  So let's stay in touch, let's do some follow-ups. if I can open up a conversation with Lisa, I'll do that.  And I'll let you know how it goes.

20:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure, sure.

20:59 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  And let me know.

21:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I send you some drafts for something?

21:05 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  Yeah, of course.

21:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't want to give you homework or anything, just maybe if you have anything. Yeah, that's fine.

21:11 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
  I'm always happy to take a look at this stuff. gets my brain thinking as well, you you're always picking up ideas from all over the place.  yeah, I'm happy to do that.

21:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you so much, Matt.

21:22 - Matt Hodkinson (tgohq.com)
