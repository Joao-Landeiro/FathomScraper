0:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How is the, how is the launch? Well, I think it's going fine.

0:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  We prepared everything now. I'm not sure if I'll be sending the comments around, yeah, think we are more or less ready.

0:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We'll see how it goes. So, for that thing that Romeo did yesterday, I sent you feedback to him and he corrected that as well.  So, we should be fine. Let open this. It's actually on the, on the G, right? It's here. Here, set this tab.  Okay.

0:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  Is this.

0:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Is this what you need? Even.

1:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, yeah, I think that's what also I'm very, man, then we have this already, so this will, as I said, this will speed you up and speed us up for a bit, so.  No problem.

1:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So when we look at the, at the, at the JIRA, I'll say because this done, I don't know if you guys use Fathom, but Fathom takes so much screen space.  And then maybe for that, we can focus on the, add the delete button for now. Yeah, yeah, but that's complicated.

1:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  One just put the button somewhere in there and that's it. But yeah, don't call it maybe, I mean, we can change the word easily.  It should be more like archive at this point because we won't delete for now. I wrote a comment down with two things.  So one is rename and. And yeah, think about adding some way on the policies, communication, training, space, you all the archive items.  Maybe you can brainstorm that a little bit now. Yeah, so it can be a total or something that can show and hide them in the list.  So we don't have to design a separate UI for this.

2:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is policies, correct? All three. Yeah, but just using as an example. Yeah, of course. So, Rumeu, what would be of setting up a to archive a policy?  Where would it be, a policy? So I'm guessing that we would have to have another status, right?

2:47 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't think this one is important to be up there. So I wouldn't put it there. I would just not show it there.  That's correct. We need another status. And we can have a talk... or something then when clicked the items just appear in the list among the other ones and when Can you give me a minute?  I'm sorry You You

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you Thank you for waiting guys, it's a bit joining or not, not so maybe we can I don't know did you guys talk while I was gone?  No, okay, so Romeo, the idea would be to try some way to Archive a policy and it will disappear, but it also have a way to make it visible, okay?

6:08 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It has a way, that's individual, right? Yes, so one by one, yes, yes. What to do is to make it easier for Ivan, we don't have to have the little there, More Bolton, Open the modal, it be more to take advantage of what is at the moment to make it for him to implement, So it would a button and try...

6:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ivan, what do you think would be easier if we add a button on this thing or if we add a button on the policy overview policy thing?

6:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's a bit better, because I don't think that's something you'll do often, so I don't think it needs to be available, it will just clutter the UI.  my suggestion would be we can edit at the top, so you're there, you have space at the top, so please download button and share for review button that exists right now, we don't have that feature.  So you can just...

7:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So which buttons don't exist, the download and the... Careful with you, we don't have those for now.

7:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  Okay.

7:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay.

7:29 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Correct.

7:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, two ways of thinking about this, either we create another group and we call it archive and throw it to the bottom.  But I think Abby might find that not to her standards. Or we just put the button somewhere inside of each box and...

7:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  I would do it, so I wouldn't do it per box, I would rather do it per page if possible.  And other solutions maybe to have access to. page with the archive like tabs, like you have governance, social, environmental, we can maybe have archive, but I'm not sure about that to be honest, I may be a little too what's best here, but I would not maybe have it per group, maybe just like at the top, like a sweet show archive and then all archive that I can show, I don't know.

8:20 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Maybe by equilibrating it to be activated, it's there in the end, I have a button to deactivate it, so it will come back to you.

8:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Then we'd have to have a button for archive and bring back to life, right?

8:32 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yes, archive button will become bring back to life after you archive it, so it's the same button, we'll just replace it.  So if you can design both, just both icons or whatever.

8:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, what else? Yeah, okay, we can decide on that then. I think you're busy, for now, this is on our side, that's it.  Okay, okay, that's it.

9:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  Thank you. Thank you.

9:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  See you, bye-bye. Erro meu, então é assim, não precisa criar mais um site, um status visual. Já, eu não, né?

9:19 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Acho algum botãozinho aqui pra direita mesmo assim, sabe? É uma coisa desse lado assim. Um, O do lado aqui, aí tem um, tem um view on, né?  só uma coisa, por aqui mesmo a gente pode gravar um botãozinho, né? sei lá, se, errar, é, eu me falo, sei lá o que eu sei.

9:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ou talvez aqui pudesse ter active, tipo, assim, um counter, tá? Um, um.

9:44 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Uma dúvida, se você perguntou ali, se você se perguntou ali rápido, eu não sei se você for claro, não.  Não adiantaria a gente criar um outro botãozinho embaixo de todas as afivadas, Eu não faria isso, porque eu acho que é, e não veio gostar.

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  and we will spend 45 minutes on that. I see.

10:04 - Romeu Rodrigues
  And when I click here to show all files, they will be displayed where they were. Exactly.

10:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The file, I think, is a group, it's a status and we have this list filtered by status or by group and by status.  So what I was thinking, look, I'm super open, so if you like to manipulate, you can put like Trees Active, Trees Archive.  This is going to be bad. Yeah, the quick and practical would I think it's little bit too much.

10:57 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I would do something more simple, it has a separation. But I think it would be a show or a party, as you said, and here it look like we had started before the olinho there, right?  Something similar that when you on it, it I wouldn't use the olinho icon, but I think that's the idea.

11:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would use an icon is like an An armory, a folder. The archive icon is like that...

11:33 - Romeu Rodrigues
  That old folder drawer. Exactly, something like that. I that's what I would use. I don't remember, but it's an archive icon.  Ok.

11:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just give me my name on this screen. Here? A comment? I don't have a task, so I'll just give it to Ok, I'll take this one, because I already sent it.

12:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Exactly, for you, but you give it to me I'll give you. And then, if you have questions, you can speak.  No, no, no, no, please. No, it's it's killing this here, the tasks that are being around here, but they are, like, blocked areas, depending on it.  And then, okay, I can go there with that task of the color if you're also calm. Uh-huh. But then, outside of that, we're...  Well, it's still good that you're with us.

12:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh-huh. you're there, I'll ask you to Uh-huh. thing that I'm going to ask you to do...

12:40 - Romeu Rodrigues
  is... you okay?

12:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's Steve's. Okay.

12:49 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I don't know if we can start taking... some Uh-huh. there's the Huberlina which is a redesign. need to... But I think it's where it's spending more energy, you know?

13:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think the ideal is... Can we discuss this now? Are you happy? Can we use the time of the call?

13:15 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Yes, I Ok.

13:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, let's go. What happens when I... When I start a form, for example, gifts, you want me start correctly, do Yes.  I need the form to be approved. How is the process of the form being approved? What do I imagine?

13:47 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm not going talk about that.

13:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We need to update... Let's start with this number here. 722. Uh-huh Oh, okay, I could work you links on second Hello Oh, hi, I write No problem actually Maybe there wasn't to be this one.  I don't know Romeo. I don't remember Romeo did mention that yesterday I think we said it wouldn't happen, but I just forgot and I joined so right now Romeo and I were just discussing Uh specific tasks that we can move on afterwards Um, so just give you a little bit of context.  Yeah, okay Okay, uh, so I'll do this in portuguese in english so For me when the person is in the form The approver has  to able to see the response of the form and say the proof or not the proof, right? Okay, so Brighton, when you are filling a form like a gift form for instance, the approver must be able to...  by the way, where did you send? You sent me the login details, the email and the password, but I don't know when you sent them.

15:24 - Brighton Wong
  Oh, I sent it in Teams yesterday, I could resend it. Can you send me via Slack so I can pick it up?

15:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Please, thank you. A wilder search rates, I can give you some content. So if I fill in a form, my task as an employee is not complete.  The compliance officer needs to look at that form and make sure the form is well filled in, right? And they need to be able to approve the information I sent.  This is true for all forms. Every time somebody, you know, sends in some information via... form, it could be a third party, it could be an employee, anyone, the admin user must be able to prove that that thing because sometimes people send the wrong information, there's an incomplete information, stuff like that.  So let me know when you have the passwords. So Romeo, what happens is that today the style of what was coded is different from the new design of all.  So it's important, thank you, right. So it's important to use the style, okay? I'm opening the thing and so share this tab, okay.  So this is the way you can see a form right now. Yeah, but this design is outdated. Ok, well, our new design is better than this, right?  Ok. So, it's to update an example of how the company appears when it needs to approve. Ok? I wanted to say in practice, these are the buttons that approve or not approve in a comment box, ok?

17:31 - Romeu Rodrigues
  The comment box would be for commenting during the process here? No, it's a good question.

17:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the... I'm really firing on all cylinders here thinking into languages. So the idea is if a compliance officer does not approve a form, they should be able to say why they are not approving the form, right?  There should be a way... of explaining their decision and the simplest way is to just put a comment box where they can just write something in and say I don't approve because of these reasons.  In the future it's much better to give put this information in a more structured way but for now this is probably enough.  So, Rumeu, your question is why he comments, right?

18:21 - Romeu Rodrigues
  That's it, I can just comment on it. Okay.

18:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, if your sole... I can create... wait, let me think better. Okay. Fortify wants to replace emails, right? I So, Rumeu, your very flexible, I can say what I want in the email.  When I only have a button approved or not approved, I lose this flexibility, right? And then people will send emails the same way, saying look, don't approve for this reason and so on.  So, the reason is that we put here a place where they can... put the comment or the justification because they approved it or didn't approve it and that's it, it's create this element of the comment box, don't approve and approve.

19:11 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Does it sense? Yes, but I think it's still a bit wrong, okay, so I commented there, in the one I sent, the story was a conversation, the person only received this message that I wrote there.  I You

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you Okay, I'm back. Thank you for your patience.

23:00 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Thank patience. with the app, until it's ok, and this is generating a log here, like an adjustment of comments, then I want receive this email here, right?  I sent it the approval, I received this negative feedback here, but it's ok. When I open this one again, I have this story of the person who didn't approve it or just received it email and it's there.  Or it generate a kind of log of approval, you know?

23:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ok, so Brighton, the question was, if I am the person filling in a form, I sent a form that was not approved.  I received the comments saying, look, this was not approved because you messed up on this question. And the question from Romeo was, does the person filling in the form see the logging of all the comments?  Let's say you've tried to do this like three times, you sent me a form, it was not approved. good, it tried again, it was not good, it tried again, was not good, right?  So Romeo's question was, do we see the log of those discussions? Romeo, I don't so. I don't it's visible, so I think it should be visible for the person feeling the other thing, but it should be recorded somewhere in the consulate later, for sure.

24:25 - Romeu Rodrigues
  So the person receives the message and then she comes back here to correct it, and says that she will do it in consulate for the first month, it would be something simpler.  Exactly, exactly.

24:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  In the future, I think in the future, I think we might have more granular views, where we say, oh, this thing was right and this thing was not right.  I guess we could do that in the future. But for the first version, let's give them a lot of flexibility, and that's it.  So Romeo, reiterating, do you just make a component that is easy to put in the background of all the...

25:02 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I think be a print, I think it's going representative, but it's going be right on the first screen, right?  I think it has to be...

25:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, it has be fixed on all that.

25:14 - Romeu Rodrigues
  It has to be in...

25:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If it were a formula with several parts... I think the comments have to be in each tab, and the approve not approve has to be in the end.  I understand.

25:31 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I'll leave the comments at the end and then in end, they'll approve, and then the person will receive the comment on the X of the stage.

25:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to say thank you, are you okay?

25:43 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Can we just do what we did later?

25:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. it's okay. I'm okay, it's okay.

25:53 - Romeu Rodrigues
  you Okay.

25:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have the... Brighton, apologize. We have decided to... Okay, let's just create this... component that is very flexible and you can put it on several other forms.  When there's several tabs, we leave a different comment box for each tab and the approves don't approve on the last page.  Okie dokie, thank you everyone. Okie dokie, thank you, have a nice one.
