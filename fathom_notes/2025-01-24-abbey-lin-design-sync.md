0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Good. Good.

0:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Então, eu acredito que só nós, certo?

2:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Sim, eu acredito. Então, vou compartilhar. Ok, como tens algumas coisas para mostrar, imagina?

2:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mesmo que cinco plantas? Sim, sim, bastante.

2:21 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Ok. Eu vou subir todas lá na coluna do... Reveal. Ok, perfeito.

2:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Então, Romeo tem muitas coisas para compartilhar com vocês, que é ótimo.

2:30 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Olha isso.

2:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Olha isso, lindo.

2:34 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Ok. Top-to-bottom.

2:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  É organizado por prioridade, então, sim.

2:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Add-button-to, Policies, Trainings & Comps.

2:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  E está aqui. Aqui.

2:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Eu vou com vocês.

3:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ok, está aqui no leitest, Rumeu? Não, na versão final mesmo.

3:14 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Aqui em cima?

3:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Coloquei os botõeszinhos na direita e o botãozinho principal embaixo de adicionar Então, esses novos botõeszinhos aqui?

3:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ok, ótimo. E a comunicação nova. Ah, espera. O que é a comunicação nova?

3:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Essa é a polícia?

3:41 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Estava no do lado em ali, ela já vai na esquerda, tem um comentário. Eu fui algum outro embaixo.

3:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Vou ver na tarefa.

3:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Dá uma olhadinha na tarefa, tem algum lugar que pediria para relocar essa? Or like is it because it might be hidden if it's if if it's Where does it come from?

4:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh it's here But it's the communications it's the communications So yeah, that's that's something we need to correct we can remove this Yeah, could probably just do it now just to lead it and I think it's Yeah, but we need to add it to communications so I saw it in communications.  No Sorry, I'm on the wrong step. So I'm getting a comment here like to remove that one. Yeah, remove from here place In Take a lot of room is it clear what to do We'll see but I think in the communications one that he drew up

5:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  was already there.

5:01 - Romeu Rodrigues
  think it's in there.

5:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Well, yeah, here's the book.

5:04 - Romeu Rodrigues
  No, that's the right maybe a policy that could be removed to there.

5:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  then communications. So the communication is not separate yet because policies and trains, they follow the same structure.

5:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but you make a good point Romeo.

5:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ask Celia, I think it would be useful to just create communications here, even if it is just a copy of policy.  the slight difference for communication.

5:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  would like the same format, but instead of company wide documents and internal documents, it'd be like Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.  So that would be the difference kind of there.

6:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll create the test here on sigma. So when I say page is this thing, OK? Yeah, so they actually have created it already.

6:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like, I don't know if you like in the app, you see that they've created a communications one already. So, but it's, can I share my screen?  Like, this is from the app itself.

6:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They have a communications page.

6:44 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we could like, and then they have a create new communication thing here. So it seems like they might have already created it.  Like, I would say then, you know, ideally, like, you know, they just did Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, but ideally it would be probably more similar.  with what you did in policy management, which they maybe already did control of the policy. So yeah, so they kind of, they already done that like company-wide policies, internal policies, new policies.  And then they just haven't added the button for the other two yet. So they just really need to add the two buttons here for engineering side.  then I could probably change the names of these. Here they haven't really broken it. Internal documents here, new policies.  they've done it for all of them. Yeah, they just haven't populated it because there's no S policies here. So they have done a lot of it.  So I would say the only thing that they're missing is a plus button, the new buttons that you drew here.  then maybe on communication, ideally it's in the same setup as what you had before, which is like, they just need to move it into this new format with three of them or four of them like that.  right? Do you know what I mean?

8:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, let me see how I can phrase this.

8:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know if we even need to draw it out because really what the engineering is, it's more of an engineering thing at this point because the engineering just needs to add the create each one on these because they only have it on the bottom, add new policy.  And then they need to kind of replicate it for the communication side.

8:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the reason I'm taking this long is just to make sure we don't lose this alignment. Let's just include a new...  Sorry, I got lost. We spoke about three different sections, I think.

9:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I think you could just say for communications separated out into Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, similar to policy management.  So Romeo, it looks just like policy management, but policy management has three sections now.

9:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it should be like an extra one.

9:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then instead of the title, like internal documents or group-wide policy, you just do Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 like that.  So then it separates by quarter.

9:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So then you can kind of map the communication per quarter.

9:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So let's just pick this up.

9:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a screenshot. Training. All three procedures. Okay. Okay. Okay.

10:11 - Romeu Rodrigues
  We will have this communication page, will be similar to the policy, and then we will insert the communications, sometimes the same format, little And that's one second.

10:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's one Thank you. Actually, I'm going to put this on design so we can discuss it later. It's not a task for us, but just we don't lose it, you learn.  Romeo, we've already talked about this, but basically it's more about development. Okay, talk about it So, we added the button and we removed the...  It's already moving there. Yeah, okay. So in this case it's... It's already working. Okay, so you remove this button, any policy, any policy, any policy, okay, okay, okay.  I think I may proceed on the last year, there's something missing here, so on this task, we need to do this.  I if there's anything missing on that one.

12:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't think there's anything, because I think it's fine, it's maybe the text, you know, like we're discussing, we're just looking at it right, know, I mean, I mean, because even made the point that I think it's relevant, which is, so no, I lost the title now.

12:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we need this.

13:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  this link over there on the design. I think they already have it on the development.

13:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just to look like the same thing. OK. Fine.

13:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm messing up your thing, Romeo.

13:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I accidentally deleted two titles on it.

13:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  can you undo it with a? I tried, but it's not allowing me to. Romeo is supposed to be like up here is supposed to say.  Like if you copy the policy, the text from the left side over here, maybe I could just do that here.  I'm just going to here. I'm going to mess it up even more. Oh, yeah, I got like, like, yeah.  I think Romeo can do it. OK.

13:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm. While I write this card are you doing it for me or something? Yeah, Romeo's fixing it now Yeah, I don't understand the question if the names are the same Yeah, like technically it should match it should actually be what I have on the left if you follow me it should be document requiring employees sign off document managed

15:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  administration and ISO documentation that should actually be the correct text but we could also change like type it like retype it.  Okay, have I cool understated?

15:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, like that. Romeo will correct on those things.

15:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. Okay, so I'll bring this to you progress.

15:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll open a new. Okay, thank you. So, showing you a tab, carbon reporting cloud. We've made this, Abby and I had a discussion.  I've made some sketches and I turned these sketches into other sketches for Romeo and Romeo. I've created a prototype.

15:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

16:05 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I think it's going to go with the prototype, because of the modems, I don't know if you prefer. But I opened it, it doesn't have a prototype?

16:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's for the project, or if you have a player on the side.

16:20 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, what is the prototype that I put on it? Shared instead.

16:28 - Romeu Rodrigues
  I made an airframe, let's see if it works.

16:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it only has a design it's not the prototype link. Oh, I have taken the wrong side. Go to the player's side, quickly.

16:46 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Here?

16:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go to project again.

16:53 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, so we would click here, suppose?

17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's a straight game, right?

17:02 - Romeu Rodrigues
  a curve. Nice.

17:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so Ebi, can discuss about this later. Okay, Okay. Yeah.

17:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, Google Cloud.

17:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Google Cloud. Okay, boa. So, do you understand if these fields are the same as these two?

17:21 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Mm-hmm.

17:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the question from Romeo is that if the fields are these, or if it's just one of them?

17:32 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think we need to actually... Let me see if I can figure this out. Well, let me check my slot, because one of our customers actually sent us their bill for it.  Let me see if I can find it. So, okay, this is... Yeah, can I share my screen? Maybe I could...  Let me take a screenshot. can send it in here so it might be easier for the design process. This is for AWS.  Let me take a screenshot. So we need to figure out, I'm putting it into the chat here. I don't think, can you put the screenshot in the chat?  Yeah, I just put it in there, you see it. Okay.

18:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. So. Yeah.

18:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Let's take a second here.

18:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But it could be that we need to.

18:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I'm going you, me and the Cognite person who found this and then like, you know, we can walk through the process to see how we found this information, you know, but then you like.  And then see if we might need to like redraw it. based off of that, but you can see they gave us the two.

19:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so this is more complex than we thought it was. Yeah, possibly.

19:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Actually, yeah, look at the next one I sent. It's the next picture I sent, because that one has the number exactly right there, the yearly carbon footprint, location-based total 297 CO2, scope 1 and 2.  Just a second, just a second. On the top left? Okay, so what do we need to put in?

19:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Well, it just says the location-based total, scope 1, 2, and 3, and then location-based total.

19:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like you can make, and there's one this monthly, right? And then one is one is carbon. so maybe the yearly one, like, gosh, it'd be good if we can get some kind of A.  Yeah, I do this, but like, if you look at the top right of that chart, you could just say monthly carbon footprint for December 26 to CO2 carbon or I think it could also be good to like, even like as storage, like, if we want to be like, store your carbon footprint data, like, I'll do take a screenshot of this and like, keep it our thing and then they put some numbers and then you're able to like, kind of track it right right now.  This is in like, this IT thing that you need to go in and see it's not on through their regular, like, day to day thing.  But, um, yeah, I'm not sure. Just a second.

20:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so. Okay.

21:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

21:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So first points. But like, yeah, because right now we're doing the cloud one, we're not doing the carbon.

21:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Are we doing carbon or cloud right now? It was my understanding that we were talking about carbon reporting related to cloud.

21:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And then, yeah.

21:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And then that is related to that. I was looking at the one at the bottom. Yeah.

21:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the point here is there's a lot of different information about carbon reporting for each for each cloud providers, right?  Yeah.

21:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And some providers might have more information.

21:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They probably represent information in different ways is likely that Yeah. And I have that.

21:56 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's where the instructions are in like that little page box that Romeo made, right? That's how I thought the instructions were, I actually, as we go through this, I almost feel like we need to actually either do it ourselves or get a customer to walk us through how they found the process and what they're looking at.  So then we'll be able to see like, yeah, but we haven't.

22:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We have some ideas regarding the instructions that we've discussed yesterday, Romeo and I, and I think they could be useful here, but just to discuss something different before.  So the point is, it's quite likely that all of these providers, they don't always give you the same numbers or organizing the same way, right?

22:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They should at least give by like a CO2 out, like the top left one, yeah, they're like on the bottom one, like the yearly output or the monthly output, like the yellow box, the orange box that you made, they should give that, that's like basic data, like that's like the data.  But which you need to, which you need to use. There are tons per carbon TCO that one so most likely it depends like these are the same thing but one is monthly and one is yearly and one is more broken down than the other, right?

23:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I understand but the point is, if we give them like a form to fill in, if a provider gives you numbers in a specific unit and another gives you numbers in another unit, it becomes really...

23:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, I think they'll give the numbers, it should be like TCO, that's like the universal standard, it should be, but we need to check this.  Okay.

23:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  TCO, how do you write TCO in the proper way? Let me write a small t and then what is TCO?

24:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Um, no, carbon total carbon dioxide, I think.

24:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  me see.

24:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  TCO T e.

24:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. So, like, so metric ton tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. That's what it means.

24:23 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  TCO to dash E, E.

24:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, one ton of, um, one ton of, yeah, metric carbon dioxide.

24:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But is it like this the way, the way? No, it's, I see, I, uh, let me just, it should be like, uh, okay.  Yeah, um, I don't know why I make this easier. I'll put it in the chat, and it's in the chat.  It's either metric tons or tons, so you can do it like that.

25:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or TCO. Like, how does, how does, does, how does, yeah, yeah. Or maybe take away the M.

25:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think if you take away the M, just go tons, carbon. Because I think if you look at the way that the AWS, what they just did, T, they didn't do empty.  Okay.

25:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But we can check, let me check really quick with it.

25:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  did, they did, yeah, TCO, yeah, tons, et cetera.

25:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, I think we didn't get the main thing. So the easiest way of solving this would be to just  allow them to upload the report that they get from each one of us, right? And we understand that just uploading the report would not...

26:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think you need to upload the report no matter what as an audit trail and to keep the thing going.

26:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So like uploading the report is good, but you still need if you're going to do any kind of dashboard or follow-up or actually maintain it in a way you have to have some kind of basic like one indicator which would be that metric ton thing.  If they could do that, forget scope one, scope two, break down like just get that one, that one number, at least one number you can track through time before you decide you want to do more detailed ones.

26:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Got it.

26:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my suggestion here is we add an inbox and a field for uploading a document. We have a field for the number and I suggest we have a drop down.  for the units, because maybe they have it in different units. Yeah. I think this is a good reminder of like trying to sit with the people actually doing it so we can capture how they look at it.  I went down like it. Sorry, right in the Portuguese. No worries. Our unit here, we take away the unit.

27:50 - Romeu Rodrigues
  let me just make sense.

27:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Remove the unit and pass this here for this drop down here. Fast.

28:03 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Okay, the point is the following.

28:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It can happen that they represent the same number of different A guy speaks in meters and a guy speaks in poligadas, for example.  So it's important to let the guy say, no, no, in the remotor that I caught, the unit is this.  Okay, so here it will a drop down. Okay, perfect. And it also important to be to upload a document.  Okay. There's another thing, Abby, that we think could help with instructions, which is this.

28:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Some of these admin consoles for these cloud providers, they keep changing. They change all the time.

28:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. And we shouldn't make this something that's difficult to update. the practical, the most scrappy start-up way of doing this, it seems to be to create a PDF file.

29:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  with instructions that we check every now and then it could even be like it could just be a Google Docs or a Microsoft online thing yeah and on that file we have the latest version of the instructions so here wouldn't have the instructions described just a link to download the instructions yeah gonna be much easier to keep keep it up yeah we could find those instructions really easily I think that would be good so we agree that we can remove this little section and add a link yeah to a Google Doc if needed or like I don't know how hard it is for the engineering team to change the directions when they when they come but I do think we need to have a spot for in it yeah it's not it's not difficult for them but the point is if the instructions are on a Google Doc you can have a cheap version

30:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That is not an even year, change that and immediately, if they are here, they get some of the, it just gets in the way of all the more valuable things.  my suggestion. No, I guess that's, yeah, I don't know.

30:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you trust us on this?

30:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's, I think it's pretty safe decision.

30:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I don't like, for me, it's like, why don't we draw it and then if we find it's too difficult engineering, then just do the PDF, you know, kind of draw how it like we ideally like it in this scenario.  And then like, I know, like a easier solution to it, but yeah, I don't know, we're over time right now already.  can you ping now and just tell him we're still in the meeting if he wants to join comes first the meeting with him now.  He went into the meeting. But yeah, I don't know, like, I guess there's other things we need to work on or are they like before we get and figure this out.  Because this is a reminder that we need to like, maybe spend some time. And then see what do they actually have and what are the actual rules?  Maybe we can figure out what the rules are and then just put them in, you know, like how far was it updated?

31:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I agree, but I really insist on this because of course it's your decision, but it's inevitable that they will change.

31:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  These guys have like engineering teams of 300 people always working on the admin consoles of their things.

31:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So they will change three months down the line. After the thing is being tested, you'll be getting feedback from pilots and they'll be asking you for urgent things and these will fall behind.  That's for sure. Yeah, no, that's fine.

31:39 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like as long as it's like a nicely designed link and a nice PDF, then that's fine. Thank you.

32:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we will not design the PDF right now. It's just to make. Yeah, we can, we have a designer that can design the PDF part that's not a part.  So in case there's, it's a different cloud provider, not Amazon, not apply these changes. So, yeah. And then it turns into a table.  A table is a very flexible kind of component. Yeah, it was already.

32:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Actually, I feel like this.

32:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Are we okay with this? Yeah, I think that looks fine.

37:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. Yeah.

37:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.
