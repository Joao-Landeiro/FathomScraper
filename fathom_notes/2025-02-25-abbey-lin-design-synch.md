0:00 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan (fortifai.co)
  oh no are you feeling better?

0:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm feeling a little bit better not the best but I slept a little bit this morning I'm on antibiotics so hopefully it'll be better soon well then because that's something yeah for like a week or so right so it's yeah it's been a week and about like yeah it was around Tuesday last week that I started feeling sick after our meeting and then it's been kind of yeah worse and then I think it's because I also went in on Friday to meet with the interns and then I have medicine now so that's the thing is that my husband now is getting really sick so oh no that's unfortunate oh yeah I was just a shell going through right and we also  are going through the forms for the environmental forms and I think those can also be plugged in the same way as the the G forms.  At least three of them are really straightforward. They're just different forms that you you plug into a survey. I don't know maybe Joelle can also send the link to that.  I don't know if Joelle's there.

1:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  These teams keep logging in with no camera.

1:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Do you want to go to a Google or the one that you? No, let's okay. Let's just stay here.

1:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So quickly, where is that? Share, share. Yes, here, share. Okay, I think you all see my screen. So So we've corrected the forms for controls and there's a few things.  now we can see that Romeo did that, he separated the forms the way we discussed. And then we've included a few things here.  So the first one, we've included this element of like why this matters sort of text. That's good. And when people say they understand, we move into the rest of the form, right?  There's different ways of doing it. Everything allows for notes and observations. We were calling these comments before, but we just changed the name for notes and observations because comments kind of assumes it's a conversation and notes and observations could be just, for record keeping more of an internal thing.  And so you can Yeah, at the top, it's just on the different scopes, right? And we don't have, actually, this was something bit, OK.  We don't have, we decided to remove the confirmation pop-up for a simple reason. Like, if we are dealing with purchased energy, chilled water, purchased heat and steam, the confirmation pop-up would be like really big.  So we just assume that, OK, at the end, they just send it and that's it. And then they can always check it back here, right?  And also, Ivan, we did that thing of trying to use the same style for the cloud to make it a bit easier to develop.

3:50 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I don't know if you will be able to do the images in this form. I'm not sure. have to check to be honest.  I've never seen it. So that's just, there's a slight. For this version, we will only be able to do like a drop-down or radio buttons with the names of this, but I'm not sure.  I will check.

4:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So, yeah, so that's it. think we've, we now have all the forms for controls and what's left now is just to organize this Figma.  Area, all the, all the things in one place, we have the forms that we discussed out today where those in case Brighton needed to access the environmental forms.

4:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  if he is putting it, I think she's going to help even put them into our tool.

4:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, where would she find the environmental ones that we just discussed?

4:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we are using this video controls as kind of a single source of truth.

4:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also, we have this thing. Wait, you're showing people. Show this tab, pull up this list, show this tab.  We also have this thing that can perhaps be useful to know, like, this is the thing, this is the forum, this is the source document, and this might be outdated, and this is what it relates to, right?  you shared this, right?

5:26 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think you did.

5:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so.

5:28 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think so.

5:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  think so. I think this is on the design channel. I'll copy it and I'll send it again to the design channel.  Okay, thanks. List of forms and documents. And come again.

5:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The IT asset register, that's a different way of working, right? The IT asset register, what is the flow for that?  For Yvonne to review. Oh, or maybe Romeo hasn't drawn it yet then.

6:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, he hasn't drawn it yet, because yesterday you and I mapped it and I didn't... Yeah, okay.

6:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, no, now you've got to confuse it. Okay.

6:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But that will be drawn, I guess.

6:15 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Mm-hmm. Okay.

6:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, okay. We've opened a few loops here, just to let's circle back for a second. First thing, we have now corrected the carbon reporting forms to put it to the controls.  I understand that even we'll need, perhaps, some time to realize there's something missing, but overall, this is what we...

6:39 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think we are missing something, which will be the screens. Where do we put the results of this carbon reporting?  discussed that these controls will be a bit specific in a way that they won't... You won't preview the responses here, because you will be the one filling it in, you and your colleagues.

6:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we will need to...

7:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  way of showing, I think I saw a design for it somewhere, at least the initial one, your design. So we need a way of showing these numbers.  I'm not even sure what are the numbers, but there is a result from this. yeah.

7:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is like a calculation, right? Like, I think it's that Excel file that Brighton had, so we need to.

7:19 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think you sketched this on the previous carbon reporting where the AWS images were before. I'm not sure where in Figma, but it was there.  Okay. Yeah, so I don't think it was really linked. I think it was just like a.

7:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, that's what I saw, but I guess we need something like this, right?

7:38 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Or not? Yeah, well, we need to somehow visualize the data.

7:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  don't know, Brighton, how in the Excel file that we have for carbon, how data visualized in a way, once they put in, you know, all of that information, a number comes out somewhere, right?  And that becomes a carbon number.

8:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My apologies.

8:04 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan (fortifai.co)
  Go ahead. Sorry, right? So after you enter all the information, they will just tell you your topter carbon emission and that's it.

8:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So even like the calculation behind it from that Excel file, we're digitalizing that Excel file where you need to get the.  Calculations, right? Because it's like so that when it puts it in some calculation goes in there, like, I don't know.  It's a one number that goes out, right? I believe it's one number per section, right?

8:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So purchase energy, you have one number at the end. But chilled water, you have a different number and purchase heat and steam, you have a different number.

8:47 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I don't.

8:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you please share that Excel again?

8:50 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  know it was shared, can you maybe share it again, please?

8:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sure.

8:57 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We have the same, but I like how.

9:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It reminded me is this set up via office like like in the beginning there should be one question because when you do this you're going to be doing a per office or per country and then you have to and then you have to combine it all together right?

9:21 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, but for now for now we are clients have multiple offices and countries or yes Cognite, Zenetta and Ardok do.  How do we know how do we know beforehand that they need to believe in this by country?

9:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They have to input that information. Yeah, they have to like I think one of the first questions that we I think and even originally had was like which country are you located or something like that and then it would pull up because also the calculations just so you know they're based off of each country right because each like a  This carbon intensity is different between Albanian and Portugal, so we need to somehow capture the information of the country so that then all the other stuff pulls accordingly, I guess.  Yeah, I can see that. I'm thinking where would we put that?

10:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe right in the beginning, guess, sorry, but not sure.

10:28 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, yeah, but what does putting it in the beginning entail?

10:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's role play this. Share this step, okay? I'm working in Brazil, right? And we have offices in Brazil and Portugal, so I click here and the platform doesn't know that I have offices in Brazil and Portugal unless I tell it so, right?

10:56 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

10:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I click here, office one scope,

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  uh scope one and I click here and I say where are you oh I say I'm in Brazil cool and then I fill in the information for Brazil and then I'm moving to mobile combustion and I still use the same numbers for Brazil right and then I complete this I complete this task right but more I guess this is a question like we're missing a step right it's more like you click on that you click on that overall that first page right and then and then it should go to a second page probably that says who are you who are you gonna who is gonna fill this out right like because it's not gonna be the current compliance person it's probably me being like I'm gonna send Brazil to Jao I'm gonna send you know Croatia to Yvonne like and then you guys are each gonna get like your own list you know like your own questionnaire that you need to fill in on these different locations that we need to somehow gather that you know Brighton get Singapore and then  and then you guys each fill it out, and when you sign in, ideally Brighton filling it in, she'll write Singapore, know, Yvonne will write Croatia, and then it will write Brazil, and then fill it in that form, and then it comes back, compile somehow, or at least like, yeah, the carbon intensity can be like displayed where you could have it in like, you know, Singapore's in red and whatever, I don't know, different countries and you can kind of compare them.  What happens if you have two offices per country?

12:32 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Do we need two reports or one is enough?

12:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Ideally, in the way that ISO 14001, it's based on location, and ideally, we would have it based on location, like if you have one in like, also on one in Stavanger, you would be able to do that because a lot of like environmental reduction is based off of offices, so you'll want to be able to split up the work.

13:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  to be able to compare them so you'll do one per office right so we need to somehow we need to so we are now in our system we don't currently have our office as an entity but we need to add it so each organization can have multiple offices and then we can relate some country to our country to it and then basically you before you start filling this in you should be able to select office not country because okay it will be connected so once you select office you selected also a country right yeah i guess it's like that good maybe we also need to do that for it for for g ones anyway too right like you're thinking about like by country you want to know like how many conflict of interest by country and different things so it is something that we need that's one possibility the other possibilities to come back like similar approach we've had for teleno and that's subsidiaries so handle them as subsidiaries so that they have their own  a whole complete bubble with their own controls and all stuff because my question this can get complex really quickly this is not something we should discuss right now but what happens when office in Denmark requires five different controls and then office in Croatia six different controls and then office in France 11 of both of these controls how do we show that in the UI and it will be a lot of duplication for for example you as an officer you will see this page that you see on Jau's screen and here you'll see all the possible controls right but we need to filter them somehow right because it will make no sense if you have 10 cedar risk you have 10 x10 rows here but you might you might actually have that because more and more the companies are becoming decentralized so that they're like that's what I'm saying I will try to avoid that scenario where we put everything in one page so  I we should discuss this, not now, so if you want to put in subsidiaries or sub-organization or call them whatever you want as a separate entity into our system and how will that relate to everything?  I know that brings the complexity.

15:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it needs to be discussed and I also think we need to think about how to discuss, how to break up ES and G because I do think we need to start selling them as separate modules instead of like talking between them.  But these are more strategic discussions that are going to have to come along with the subsidiary one. So we need just to figure out when to do that.  Go ahead.

15:44 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's a question what we will do now as a temporary solution. the key here is that temporary solution because whatever we decide later it will be a big change because we cannot just do something right now.  We can have a picker where you select a country or office, but long term we will have to do something better than that.  It will be a bit tricky to relate the old data that was done this way to the new data that the future will be done in a different way.  That's my concern with this. So if we could somehow avoid the subsidiary for this first phase, that would be great.  If not, then we need to discuss as soon as possible how we will handle the multi-organization that has multiple...

16:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think we have several pilot feedback meetings this week and we should ask them how they would ideally like that set up, just to understand their organizations too, but I think we at least need to have multiple ones.  We know that at least in Zeneta they have multiple offices and they've already tried to get the data, so we need to have some way of assigning the different forms to different people.

16:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's fine.

16:56 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think Yvonne's question is a little bit different. No, no, I get it.

16:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I get it.

17:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  is my point is like we're not going to answer it in this conversation and we do have meetings with all of our pilots that can ask them you know how important is it like I said like that and we could try to figure this out for them.

17:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But isn't this like a blocker because if we need to we need to decide how to handle multiple locations this blocks the development of the controls.

17:24 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes I mean we can still do the forms the part which will for sure be the same but we need to make a decision how will we handle that some the pilot a hydro or whatever it needs to have about two same carbon reporting forms one for Croatia and one for Norway we need to decide how we will handle that.

17:45 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But I do think they are going to need it like everything is now not just one entity right like whether and it's like going to be like one country but two cities and different things like most companies when they grow they're going to have multiple ones.

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The real scenario will have to tackle sooner or later.

18:03 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  My ideal case would be later, a bit later, but if we have to, we need to discuss the strategy now.  my concern is, okay, maybe for pilots, we can manually add them, their subsidiaries and stuff in the database, but for future ones, we'll have to add a whole UI and how they can manage their subsidiaries, create organizations, and spend time in the programming days and bring some complexity to the system.  Absolutely.

18:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have some ideas now that maybe we can use for this thing just as stopgap things, just as improvisation, right?  So here's what I'm thinking. I start, let's share the screen. So let's say I have these controls here, right?  And we'll need to rethink this thing, for sure. But let's say I just click on this thing, scope one, right?  And it asks me, it should have like a screen before this, okay?

19:06 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  And the screen says which location, right?

19:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And if you don't have any location, you add location. Okay, a button. Okay, so we have a location and now that location will show up on dropdowns at the start of all of this.

19:32 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So.

19:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So put that here in the name, carbon reporting office one slash Oslo, you know? I don't love this, but it would allow us to move quickly.  And, but then later we would have to find a way, a better way of grouping these things together, which might mean having a selector here for each location.

20:04 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Just to upgrade your solution, what would be the easiest for us, I think, would be to duplicate the controls and just call them differently and that's it.  So let's imagine that Hero needs to have two carbon reports, normally in Denmark. In the database, we can give them two different controls just with different names in the title so they don't even have to choose.  And that way we get to control immediately for them that are basically in our database two different controls which are just different by name.  The content will be the same and then they can fill them in separately. But for the pilots, right? Yes, but long term, this is also a bit tricky and will be tricky to convert the current solution to the later one because we need to analyze the data and we need to aggregate the data so we need to somehow have, but okay, we can try to think of something how to solve it.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to be flexible in the future, hopefully. So perfect, I like that idea. So in that case, you don't need this for the pilots?  Yeah, We don't need this for pilots.

21:12 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  If that's fine by them, although Epic, they will unfortunately need, we need to find the way how they can share it with different people because not everyone will be admin and currently these forms, okay, I think I know we'll just make these forms available for employees via a URL and then they can share the URL to the, or link to the people who need to see it.  And we can for now link the sharing to them for this first version, just tell them this is the link to share it this way and later we can have a nice feature of clicking share, then you get an email and stuff like that.

21:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because we don't have unfortunately time for the whole flow. So just to close this loop, we have in this conversation,  the issue of the multiple locations and we've also agreed that we will just hard code multiple locations for these pilot customers.  But we'll need to find a way that is more stable and you know, organized to handle this in the future.  Correct? Okay, okay. Another loop that is still open and we need to close, which is so people input information and at the end they get a number, right, which was the thing that brought us to this discussion.  Go ahead.

22:35 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, and that can also, yeah, be in the dashboard or visualize the dashboard area that we haven't created yet.

22:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it could be like the very simple version of that would we share this? Okay, come here. The simplest version of a dashboard that I think we could make is, it's a long dashboard.  And in this dashboard we have sections. And we inside of these sections we have effects and figures, right? And like this is a section about carbon reporting.  This is a section about policies. And there's other things. This is a section about whatever. This is not pretty.  This is not great. But it would allow us to give them access to the information that they are inputting.  And as we move on we can help them have a tighter dashboard. What about this?

24:02 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This is the one above the compliance map you made. Here? What? I am not sure.

24:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I meant, like, it's that one that you just showed right before. Oh, this thing.

24:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. This thing? Yeah, here.

24:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, no, this is the home, right? Oh, no, this is the dashboard. OK. But it's not functional.

24:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But I guess we could have, like, white boxes with an H1.

24:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, this is about numbers related to policies, trainings, and communications. And then we have another box. This is numbers related to, you know?  Exactly.

24:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  My question is the time frame, because we need time to build this page. I know, but we also have to, like, this is an important part, like, of our tool is to show that.  like this is what helps people manage and have data centric output, just having the protocols and that. So it is important so we just need to figure out what is the best to get it done or yeah.

25:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What's a trade-off that we're willing to do? mean making trade-offs is normal as long as we in agreement about them right?  Is there anything that if we don't do gives us more time or more bandwidth to include some dashboards? Or is another question okay?  So we've now discussed two paths, two paths. Sometimes my pronunciation goes to . Okay, path one, path two. Okay, path one is  mvp dashboard, one long page, right? It's not pretty, not nice. Just give them somewhere to look at the numbers.  Path to confirmation popups at the end of control input, right? So let's say we are calculating the emissions for cloud, we go through this thing and at the end it's not designed because we thought it wouldn't make sense, but in this strategy maybe it does.  We have a popup that says confirmation. Thank you for including all this data. by the way, your score is whatever.  And that's it. Are these options, did I explain these options in a good way? Do you understand what I mean with these options?  Yeah, I would say we need path one.

27:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  um because path 2 doesn't really help it's like a pop-up great on a random Tuesday you get a pop-up of a carbon reporting that's not actually when you need it you need it actually you know when you're talking to manager or when you're having a board report or not that you want to have a central place where you can kind of track it and see see the progress of it that you have it under control so I think that's like a part of you know what what we need to have but whether or not it needs to be immediate versus after third party you know is another discussion but the point is it eventually needs to get done but I need to yeah jump into a call with telenoir now but um yeah it's just that we can eventually for for for controls and policies and procedures and trainings for any of them to be working is that you're going to need to be able to monitor the progress in an easy to use way not having to go into like okay and I'm on policies okay go in and go look at deployment for policies  Now I need to go to communication, I need to go and run into the deployment of communications.

28:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's like, no, you have everything in your dashboard, and you can see the progress of these things that you've already deployed.

28:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's the usefulness of our tool, and so. I think the vision is very clear.

28:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's just that what can we take away to give us, to get us somewhere, because we cannot just add things on top of the.

28:25 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I didn't even know that part two will needs to be done for the control part. Maybe I misunderstood something, but it doesn't need to be done, but I need to run into the thing.

28:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think it's just more that this is always been on our path that we needed to do it. Maybe we've kind of forgotten about it when we were like just trying to get rid of some of these things.  But the dashboard has always been, it's like why we drew it up very quickly. Yeah, let's see what we can do then.  Okay, but you guys continue. Yeah, I need to go meet what's happening.

28:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, I'll talk to you guys later. Okay, bye.

28:57 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Well, yes, I'll do anything. I'll put them from from my side.

29:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I'll just like to work with you to find a way that, you know, it's also fair and that works for you guys in terms of this.  I don't think currently there is anything special.

29:15 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  mean, if we need to build a dashboard and what you throw this fine, we can just maybe keep the content to a minimum just couple of graphs or something just to check the box dashboard.  But I think that if we need a dashboard and we need a dashboard, we cannot avoid doing it. So I think what we can make compromise is on what they're born includes and indeed that will be graphs for now.

29:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's that's fine.

29:39 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  If it will be some multiple graphs, filters, all that stuff, we don't have time for that. And we don't have time for it either way.  So maybe we can talk to everyone once we get on a call again sometime will we won't do this week so we won't do this dashboard stuff.  this week for sure so we can discuss it once you come back but basically I would say that we need to we need to define three two three graphs that are crucial for controls or something and just show that for now for showcase and make it pretty and that's it and then build on that and then we're using some library uh yeah we are charges but you can see it so the the graphs that you saw the graphs that you saw on the dashboard page that's dummy those are real graphs so we just dummy data in so as far as we are concerned we can use that styling for the graphs I think we implemented some kind of a design already there was some thing messed up with these graphs so we did that so yeah if we can just do that that's that's that's the best case scenario for us yeah okay so we will yeah prioritize like one or two pieces of information that check the box of the of the dashboard but

31:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  are still kind of doable. yeah, got it. Understood.

31:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I'll help.

31:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay.

31:11 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Good luck.
