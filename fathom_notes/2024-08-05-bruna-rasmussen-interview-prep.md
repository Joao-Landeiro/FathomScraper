0:00 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Alright, so before we start, I'd like to make a few clarifying questions. So right now we already have a onboarding experience that is very basic, very vanilla.  want to take it to the next level because the hypothesis here is that if we adjust these onboarding experience based on what users expect and want to get out of class pass experience, this will enhance their engagements.  Is this the hypothesis we're working in?

0:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, engagement is the final objective, but for now we would like to focus on the the activation. like the first, I'm looking at engagement as a longer term thing, but let's focus for now in activation.  So Jack is setting up, setting up like the first a few classes. Let's say the first three classes.

1:03 - Bruna Rasmussen
  First class book. Okay. Give me a minute so I can I'm and I'm I'm I'm back to book and and next  Okay, so the way that I will go about this problem is we'll start with thinking about a few user segments, then we'll choose one of the segments, think about their pain points, select pain points, and think about solutions.  From there, we will go about detailing the MVP features, the endometrics, does that sound good?

2:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, thinking about user segments, select one, think about pain points, select one, think about solutions, and from those solutions, figure out an MVP.  Yeah, Okay. And you also said something about metrics, right?

2:49 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Yeah, we should think about what, how we want to measure the success. Okay. Is that a good direction towards the moment?  Yes, I think so, yeah.

3:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

3:03 - Bruna Rasmussen
  All right. So let's think about the user segments of new users that just heard about class beds and entering the app for the first time, and then they will look at the onboarding experience.  So we can think about complete beginners, people that have never exercised in their lives or aren't really engaged on fitness, and I think that that's a very large segment of users that go through class beds to initiate their fitness lives.  And I think that the onboarding experience is very relevant to A second user segment we can think of are to cooperate.  corporate users. So, we know that ClassPass has been working hard on establishing this partnership with large companies, so these companies can provide their workers with a ClassPass subscription, and this is, let's say, a medium-sized segment, but happening this onboarding experience is important to them.  So, we can actually get them to activate the ClassPass. Do you have a third one? Yes.

4:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, go ahead.

4:46 - Bruna Rasmussen
  We could think about fitness enthusiasts as well, which are people that may be using ClassPass to supplement their current workout routines.

4:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a

5:00 - Bruna Rasmussen
  a smaller segment, if we compare that to the beginners, so we could say it's a median or small segments, let's say it's a small segment, and because they are already into fitness, they know what they're looking for, the impact of onboarding is not as large.  So I would say it's a median. Where the onboarding is most important here is on the beginner segment. So I think that although the hypothesis here is that yes we should have a personalized onboarding for all of these different types of users to validate if the onboarding really does move the needle, I think we should start with optimizing the onboarding for one of the segments.  See if improving this onboarding really, really moves the needle and helps us with activation. Is that a good direction to go?

6:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think so, but I'm also thinking that there's another POT we can take, which is like onboarding as a journey, as there's several steps to onboarding and how we could figure out what steps are more relevant to improve.  So, a lot of parents do do well, but then while they are the segmental, they are the same as they are the same as are the same as are the same as as are the same they the  this wasn't my questions any longer not? to that I You know, in order so, and with Chen.

7:24 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Oooh! Is he still here now? you him? Let me ask you a clarifying question. during the current onboarding, what are the most having information that we need to collect?

7:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I would separate sign up from onboarding. But for the purposes of this question, I will... No, answer your question.  So we need, you know, the usual name, social security number, email, age, gender, we need, yeah, these are the things we need to start to create like an account.  And then to book the first class, we also need doctors, how do you say like clearing, like this, yeah, this person is clear to exercise.  And how do you say when like a checkbox in the liability, like if I, I don't have any, you know, injuries or previous injuries that could, you know, negatively affect my experience here.

8:55 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Got it. So currently, The information that we ask for Burkina class first is the doctor document and those for injuries.  Yes. And the rest comes into the signup.

9:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

9:13 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And when we think about this onboarding journey, where does it begin? It's right after you conclude your signup process.

9:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The onboarding journey begins after, yes. So you create like this first, you sign up with the very basic data.  And so you are not just to lead anymore, but you're not activated yet. And so you can book the first class.  You need to give us this kind of information. And with this, you are technically okay to sign up. So we just, the video onboarding just asks you these questions.  I just list it. And then takes you back to a page where you can look for experiences that are interesting to you.  This is the vanilla onboarding.

10:09 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So let me just play back. So like sign up, I provide the doctor documents and the checkbox for injuries and then I have access to all the classes.  So this is before I actually book a class. Correct.

10:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. All right.

10:26 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Good. Thanks. Do we have any qualitative feedback that we've gotten from this process or these assumption comes from us really from my internal hypothesis.

10:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  From user interviews, not the huge number, but from some user interviews we've noticed that whenever people sign up for class pass, and they are not thinking of class pass as a service, but they are thinking of class pass to get access to a specific thing to look for, for instance Pilates.  Oh, I'm looking for Pilates. Oh, I've heard class pass as Pilates, right? So when they come through this way, they usually are really quick to set up the first class because they know what they're looking for.  And we see like an interesting correlation there. And based on those weak signals, they are weak, but they seem to make a lot of sense from an realistic perspective.  We assume that a customized onboarding experience that connects with people's goals could accelerate this first class booking.

11:46 - Bruna Rasmussen
  You got it, you got it, that makes sense. Okay, so the way that I will go with that is to first, based on this tree, this tree.  three segments that we talked about earlier, so beginners, corporate customers, and businesses, and suggests, understand what are their main motivations to join classPES and we will learn out a few hypotheses on what they're looking for.  So if we think about beginners, they really don't know where to start, they probably are not familiar with the recent, most recent fitness trends, they have difficulty to perhaps understand what is the best suited workout for them to begin with, so they really need a higher guidance on this.  For corporate customers, a mixed, a mixed, it can be a mixed, a hybrid audience in the sense that there may be some fitness enthusiasts there or beginners.  So we kind of need to serve for both. The hypothesis here is that location plays an important role because they may want to search for, for example, studios that are near where they, their workplace.  And when we think about business enthusiasts, hypothesis is that they will either be looking for classes to supplement their basic fitness routine that they already have or they are looking for challenges because as they are ready is very easy.  people, they may be looking into fitness trends, new kinds of studios and classes for them to challenge themselves. So this may be the main motivation.

14:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, apologies, can you repeat, I was typing down, could you repeat two points you've mentioned on fitness enthusiasts, so supplement fitness routines and there was something else?

14:24 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Looking for challenges, because they may get bored and they really eager to see what is the newer trends and fitness that they have around their tongues.  Now, the way that we could think about the onboarding experience for them is first. How do we know if a user, a new user, answering class pass belongs to each of the segments?  I think so. For the corporate one, it's easier because we could use their account information, we probably already know if there are links to a corporate account or by checking their, their email.  So this is an easy way to technically segment them under the hood, but then it comes the the need for us to understand if the user is a beginner or is a few continuous enthusiasts.  And this also applies to corporate users. So I think we should first think about if this is a corporate user, then think, have way on the onboarding to get information and see if they are beginners or enthusiasts.  Yes. Okay.

15:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  could do that.

15:57 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Bye. different ways. There are different ways to find that out. So, for example, we could ask if they have done fitness classes before or for how long they are exercised.  A second way that might be more user-friendly and motivating is actually asking about their goals. So, you are here at class pass.  What do you want? Select your interests. So, for example, I want to get fit. I want to lose weight.  want to improve my strength. I'm a beginner. don't know where to start. So, by giving these different options, we could have the user selecting what is their main goal by using it.  the same class pass?

17:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and I do have a quick question. Apologies. which is Users of class pass. mean we have noticed that when there's a social component to it It improves on several metrics But it is not necessary for the grid experience, right?  You could just sign up and if you are disciplined in person, you can just do it alone and So it doesn't matter as if I have to balance out how much each factor matters The segment in the ways we've been describing here matters But might matter less than the more individual, know, granular aspects of it So  We've discussed this from a segment perspective, and this is assuming that the segment influences the onboarding. If you were to explore a direction where the segment itself doesn't influence the onboarding, but more the individual preferences of the person regardless of where they come from influenced the onboarding.  If you were to take this perspective, would it change anything in your approach?

18:36 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Let me see if I understood your question. We are looking at this from a segment perspective where we want to tailor a onboarding based on the segments.  question is if we were to drop these segments for a bit and understand how the onboarding could work or not.  user-specific level, how this will change my approach. Is that correct? Yes. Yes.

19:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because basically what I'm saying here is that we have an assumption here that the segment influences the onboarding.
  ACTION ITEM: Consider removing segment-based approach and focusing on individual preferences for onboarding. Prioritize MVP features: personalized goals based on age/gender, class type selection, location selection - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ybWyic2qz1iavQ6MdAWrxyzbJECrnoAL?timestamp=1151.8799000000001

19:14 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Yes.

19:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It could be the case that it doesn't influence as much, right? Because I could be joining in from a corporate account and be a fitness enthusiast.  And I know this is why you've branched out the corporate accounting. But if we were, let's say we are pressed for time, not in terms of an interior, but in terms of development time, right?  And we want to figure out what's the most relevant crossroads in terms of user segmentation or experience segmentation. And we have like, we want to keep our onboarding really lean and just ask very, you know, approach.  have this approach, the segment approach. then that we could later granularize, let's say. I would like to see if we can have a different approach that is not so much related to segments, like groups of people, but more like to individual.

20:15 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Did you use your meet? Yeah, that's completely, I think that's another way at looking at it, definitely. So we can think, for example, about classes types.  So how the user has a preference, we can look at location. Okay. Is there any specific location? We know that, for example, for corporate users, and we said this might be more important than for a person who works in home.  Then we have a price sensitivity. We have. Also, we can think about how the user perceives fitness trends, so how much they want to they care about new trends.

21:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can give you a little piece of information. We have noticed from past feedback and conversations with users that there's a certain seasonality to signing up to a class pass, which is around new years.  People sign up for a class pass a little bit, not crazy amounts, because we affect your reading of the scenario in any way.

22:01 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I think this totally makes sense as people make their new years, I forgot the name in English, but these promises, and I think that's a fun way to engage them, definitely.  We could even think more about this as an isolated problem, but we could have this seasonality thing as one of the factors here in the motivation of users and how we're going to think about a solution for us.  So if we think, for now we have talked about preferences for classes types, we have talked about location, price sensitivity, and the needs of how they are aware of trends.  So if we think about these needs, let's put in this way, these needs of these users, and think about the journey.  I would still keep, I think that selecting your goal at class bus is a must-have. So we can also tailor the experience for them and I think this is relevant for us to keep track of different user segments.  So the user would select their goal. If we think about the classes types preferences, we could show them the different classes types that are available, but before that we should ask for their So I would go about asking them to share their location.  If we're talking about the mobile app, we can can also leverage the system preference of sharing location or just allow them to select whichever city there are.  Once we have their location we'll be able to see all of the classes types that are available to them and then allow them to select which classes types interest than the most.  I think that with this step of the onboarding we would also understand how much the user cares about trends.  If they select lots of classes, different classes we can say that maybe they are like more hypothesis that they would likely select more classic types of fitness classes such as glasses, yoga, etc.  And last, the one need we didn't touch here is price sensitivity. So something that we could do is try to understand how frequently they intend to work out, meaning if they are looking to work out like try to week or four times a week.  But at the same time, I think that this need is actually not a must-have for us to handle this on the onboarding, to be honest.

25:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm curious about the rationale behind it. Not saying I agree or disagree, just want to know.

26:00 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So, I think that one, class-class models is based on the fact that the prices are dynamic, based on popularity, offerings, etc.  So, it's hard to guarantee an amount of classes. Second, I think that for the purpose of them booking their first class, they may be less price sensitive and more like trying to understand how class passwords and how class-class can bring value to them.

26:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, is this an assumption? Yes.

26:48 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay.

26:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  the assumption is, not agreeing, not disagreeing, but the assumption is, for the first, you know, experience, people are less prices, if they are more open to

27:01 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And then they will become more priceless once they start futureing and looking for classes and understanding how frequently they want to work out a much like I can see arguments both for both sides like having or not having it for the onboarding.  We can list here but I think it's like more of a should have than a must have for thinking about prioritization but we can go about thinking prioritization next.

27:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No it's fine I mean we don't need to drill down on everything it's just important that whenever we select to go or no go have a reason behind it and I think it just presented it so we don't need to branch out infinitely on this it's fine.

27:55 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So just to recap so far the journey we're thinking about it as the user will select their goal in pass, they will toggle location, they will choose class types that they are interested in.  They can provide us with how frequent they once they intend to work out using class pass per week. And later we also need to gather the must have information from the legal perspective, so the doctor documents and the check out for injuries.  I will definitely leave this last because then we already have the user already engaged on the process and it's less likely that they will give up.  Also on the document, the document check, I think that the user might not have the document right away with them or say you need to go to the doctor.  So I wouldn't use this as a blocker for them to begin the experience. Yes, it is a blocker for them to actually book a class, but it's not a blocker for them to see the experience and start seeing classes and in future and learning about class class.  So the way that I would do with that is give them the chance to upload if they do, but they could skip and add it later.  So it will be sort of a soft and boring and after that, when they, let's say that they did not submit documents, they could still see the void.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. It uploaded that.

29:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. I like this idea and I think there's, There's a lot of possibilities behind that. also appreciate how you connect this with the idea that at least we get this information.  Even if the person doesn't take the class, we have a little bit more understanding of our customer base. I do have, I don't know if I interrupt you.  I interrupt you?

30:19 - Bruna Rasmussen
  No, no, please. Go ahead.

30:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, you've listed goals, possible goals, and these goals you've listed in terms of health, mobility, weight loss, just trying out new things, know, getting ready for some events.  These things, they make intuitive sense. How would you go about dealing with people that have trouble expressing are selecting a goal.  Is it difficult questions, or if you need time to write things down or figure it out? I think it comes down to how we word it.

31:29 - Bruna Rasmussen
  How we work the options for them, in the sense of a wicked frame it, as showing the benefits for them.  Such as, think that there are a few very obvious such as weight loss, I want to lose weight. Or I want to feel bitter and healthy, it's a very clear benefit.  Or I want to grow muscles, want to grow strength. I want just for general health for not getting so tired.  This is a matter of how we are wording and framing this to the user in a way that's very obvious for them and what are the benefits that they're looking for.  We could even play a bit with the idea of seasonality. We could even have this there. I want to look good for the summer.  I want to follow my new year promise. We could even play a bit with that if there is a continuity to the experience later.  It's all about how we word it in a way that it makes sense both for the fitness enthusiasts, for the beginners so they really understand what they're looking for.

32:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have an extra piece of information, actually two different extra pieces of information. And I'd like to know if these effects or in which way these effects you're thinking.  So one of the things we've noticed is that whenever we have more qualitative approaches and ask people and to interview people, we don't have a lot of these, okay?  So these are kind of weak signals. But we have noticed that there's a certain correlation with age and there's a couple things we've seen.  We see a bit of a gender distribution. Women are slightly more interested in mobility, pilates, less impact sort of stuff, yoga.  We've also noticed that men after a certain age also start to have a little bit more interesting in this stuff, whereas younger men usually go for the weight lifting or combat sports sort of sessions.  So I told you there were a couple of pieces of information, so there was the age and like evolving patterns of the age.  And there's something that we didn't fully explore, not UNI, but as the company didn't fully explore, but you know, perked up our years, which is when people talk about influencers or triggers, like whenever we see people mentioning Goggins, they want the crazy stuff.  Whenever we see people mentioning Jessica Amato, they usually want more, they are more interested in more mobility stuff. Is this, do you see any way of using these sort of big signals in your approach?

34:47 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Oh, that flame. Given that we, at this point of the journey, we already have data about their gender and age.  We could definitely use this to prioritize the order or even the selection. action of thickness gloves that we are going to showcase so they can select.  For instance, using this example that you gave for, let's grab the male gender. So for a young man, we could showcase things like more focused on strength and cardiovascular capacity, while for older men, we could focus on yoga, mobility first and then bring the rest.  So I think I would definitely use these data points to prioritize how we are ordering this information and perhaps making some adjustments on the options we give the user.

35:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So just a quick prompt, I think maybe This is the thing you were about to do. You've explained to me like your approach this.  I've given you a little bit more information. We've appended this information to your approach. Could we do a quick recap of the last 10 minutes just to?
  ACTION ITEM: Recap onboarding journey discussed so far - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ybWyic2qz1iavQ6MdAWrxyzbJECrnoAL?timestamp=2173.7398989999997  Absolutely, absolutely.

36:18 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So the journey we're looking at is the user will select a goal. This goal can be the way that we are selecting this goal.  It can be influenced by the age and gender. We can do that by simply ordering it differently. think that's something that we also talked was how this should be framed as benefits.  So it's super clear for the user, even for the beginners, to choose what they're to understand what they're looking for.  Then we will go about asking for location, showing class types that are available in that loop. and that the user could choose from.  You would ask them how frequently they want to work out and then ask for the document, medical document, and to check for the legal implications.  That's the journey we are currently discussing.

37:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very well. This is really good. I understand the basic journey we are designing here. have more time, so it's fine.  But I might have spent too much time on this part. Can we start to explore how to go about developing, testing, everything in this sort of stuff?

37:50 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Should we go back to address the influencer question? Or just keep it for now? Okay, so let's move on to how we can implement and make an MVP out of it.  Okay, so I think I will. I will first look at the metrics and what success looks like for them us to define the MVP.
  ACTION ITEM: Define key metrics for success: % of users booking first class within 1 week, drop off rates at each step (guardrail) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ybWyic2qz1iavQ6MdAWrxyzbJECrnoAL?timestamp=2375.599899  Does that is that okay?

39:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, that's fine.

39:40 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay, so how do we know that this personalized awarding experience is successful? Well, I think that the in our start that we're looking here is the percentage of  users entering the app and booking a class. Something that we could also look at and that's very relevant and is the time for users to do it.  So are they doing it within one hour, within a day, within a week. This is very important.

40:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

40:32 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Time to booking something like that. Time to book.

40:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, definitely.

40:35 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Time to book. This would be a signpost metric. Another signpost will be the drop of rates. This would be important for us to know if the onboarding is to.  Don't worry if any of the steps doesn't make sense.

40:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, you mean drop off? Can you drop off Yeah, we definitely could think of it as the end to end conversion, which is the successful.

41:27 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And also, we should definitely measure the drop-off between the journey, so screen by screen. To understand granularly how the users are moving on throughout the journey.  And as a longer-term metric, I would definitely look into the retention of the Because the hypothesis here is that if the user knows what he wants out of class bus and we are able to gather this information and provide a experience that is aligned with that, they will retain better.  So this is something that we can look into longer term like trade six months. If we are okay having a hold up work for that.  And I would have the instrument conversion or it's another way of looking at the general drop off rates as a guard rail.  Because we don't want this to be the entry. Let's to clarify. Let's call it an instrument conversion. We don't want it to be less than the current one.  It should be at. is the same or bad. So let's put it this a guard rail metric.

43:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I really like this one.

43:11 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So all right, so just to summarize, we are looking, the North Star metric will be the rate of users booking classes.  As a signpost, we will have the time to book a class. And as we would also have as a signpost, not as a signpost, sorry, I will have as stage.  I don't think it's necessary to have it as a signpost, but more of a monitoring metric. and I will have as a guardrail the M2N conversion.  Now, how will we go about understanding an MVP for that? I think that on the selecting goal, what I would not add to an MVP is the intelligence of ordering the goals by looking at those data points about gender and age.  I would not add that to the MVP. I think that simply showcasing the users with these goals in an engaging way, and we can think about that as adding icons or pictures or doing some sort of a tinder experience where you can select what.  those men to you or not. It's important enough for us to gather that information and have the user at least started to get engaged with us.  Okay. The location one is a must-have very straightforward either way that we want either choosing city or allowing the the location services.  Yes.

45:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  for class type, this is pretty straightforward as well.

45:36 - Bruna Rasmussen
  I think that the MVP approach comes down to how we are going to figure out the UX of it.  But again, I think it's pretty straightforward. Most have. Now, when it comes to the frequency, I think we can get this out of the MVP.  I don't see it as a must-have for us to. to get the user to sign their first class. And then we will go about having the medical document and the checkbox for legal purposes as the last one.  Something that just comes to mind that we could also consider for, not for the MVP, but for later, is to also drink the referral program into the end of this recording.  We could have some prompts like, hey, you know that people who work out with friends or family, they step to their goals more often, something like that, to incentivize people to work out together, et cetera, and also start to return friends.  But this is something that we could Live it on the backlog for now.

47:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Very well. So how do you relate these topics with the overall objective of a more customized onboarding? So we have goal, have have class type, have frequency, and then we have something that is just necessary, which is the medical document in legal liability checkbox, so that doesn't count towards customization.  But in terms of customization, we have so effectively a goal, but not necessarily ordering the possible goals, correct? Just present different goals.  Location, yep, makes us. Class type must have, the PMVP is about the UX. Could you... Okay, I'm interested in knowing more about this little sentence that I think holds a lot of things behind it.  The PMVP is just... about the X. I don't want to derail you too much this conversation, but can you expand just like a few to tweets more on this?

48:13 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Okay, so I agree with your point that removing the ordering of select goal makes it less personalized. I do think if Northstar is percentage of users using boot in the class, it is not as relevant, but we really want to test out this specific usage of data points to improve this stuff.  It's something that we could consider and it's not hard to do.

  I'm not saying that you need to do it, okay, this is not a roundabout way of me telling you that you need to do it.  But if you could expand more on the... you can't think square away from you, okay, so... There are many different of your mind, we noticed with And this a of things but not the same.  You know Interpreter, go ahead and say, Okay. fix the sound. Perfect. I'm not going to say that. I'm going to that.  to say that. Okay. you have any questions? you've be and then So, going to be to the risk of that.  I it's not a thing.

50:16 - Bruna Rasmussen
  You're going to be you're going be don't have stop here? Yes, be scared.

50:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to and that's why look at image the that have, we can put a key to image have seen. UX, and then can put image here.  that's right. In the same way, to present them in the text box these up, so that way they have some looks at it continuous, contrast the experience it  What I'm not allowed to change to everyone this not this or But it's that or But that's I'm a bad guy when I'm a bad guy.

51:27 - Bruna Rasmussen
  So Okay, and now we can you, you're in what we are trying to to validate here or not is the customization helping with the user reaching to the NARF star.  I will definitely keep the data points and how we are offering showcasing and ordering the user goals in the first step of the journey.

52:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

52:17 - Bruna Rasmussen
  Then we would ask for location and of course there is also the location-based customization here. There are edge cases that we need to pay attention to.  For example, what if the location doesn't have a lot of different types of classes while we know that in large cities we do have dozens of options of classes in smaller towns.  It may not be so much. So we need to have a fallback option to when this happens.

52:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Love it.

52:53 - Bruna Rasmussen
  And I wouldn't keep the how frequent do you want to work out? Because based on this, something that we could give the users is maybe a suggested plan on how they could start their fitness routines with class bus.  So let's say a user likes yoga and lattice, they are in New York in which these classes are available, and they want to work out twice a week.  We could then provide them with a suggested plan of, hey, maybe you could do one class of yoga, one class of lattice, each week, and here are a few studios nearby that you could find some other classes.  So we would already start their journey with a more first, a very, very personalized suggestion on how they could actually book the class.
  ACTION ITEM: Suggest providing users with a shortlist of 2-3 class options based on their stated preferences and location - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/ybWyic2qz1iavQ6MdAWrxyzbJECrnoAL?timestamp=3240.599899

54:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, okay, go ahead.

54:09 - Bruna Rasmussen
  This would definitely help us reach the goal of more users looking to a class because there is less option for them to choose from.  And this would create less cognitive, cognitive load, yes, perfect.

54:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the assumption there is that by providing people with the short list of options you remove that analysis paralysis and people can just pick something that makes a lot of sense instead of getting lost and overwhelmed by many options.

54:54 - Bruna Rasmussen
  They tell us their preferences and we do something with that to help them. Thank you. OK, love it.

55:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, I'm enjoying this, please. So you've characterized the challenge. You went over how you would go about it, both from a segment perspective and also from a more journey-centric perspective.  Then we've discussed metrics. I think you were really strong on the metrics and now you think about metrics. And then we went into the MVP.  And you also explained your decisions in terms of what to prioritize and what not to prioritize. And now you suggested some possible options.  Would you like to add something else? Do you feel that it's an aspect that you want to meet?

55:58 - Bruna Rasmussen
  No, I think it's strong on the beat. to show them the PES to test out for this personalization. And I think it really is helpful for, if we think of both beginners, corporate users, fitness enthusiasts, I think it makes a lot of sense because for beginners, it will help them do their fine suitable workouts for them.  For corporate people, it will show places near them. For enthusiasts, they can show different classes around them. So I think it's really powerful when they think of Cool, cool.

56:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it is it. I'll switch back to Portuguese.

56:46 - Bruna Rasmussen
  OK. Go on.
