0:00 - A L
  for today with heat or rain. I just took some shots and saying like, this is the employee point, I cut out some of it because the controls isn't ready.  And I was saying, you know, policy is ready to test, you know, employee portal ready to test. And then, and then I tried to add and like, it like in preparation, let me follow this colleague there.  You know, what documents and trainings you know, do you have so we can test it? you say any name, just take orders who will review them?  You know, we'll not send any information. Any other kind of questions or we don't have to write all of them either.  I like this more.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so from the top of my mind, maybe something that gives a sense of progress would be to have a list of last time we showed you this.  Now we are showing you this. And even if the second, if the section is not. fully develop the new section, we can add details.  instance, we've made the policies easier to understand for first-time users or for junior staff, which is maybe a concern of senior staff.  Yeah.

1:16 - A L
  Since last time, you know, we showed overall design, or last time we showed overall design plan or kickoff of building a tool now, updated design to make it easier to implement for stakeholders, policies, trainings, and communication.  for deployment overall design progress I guess a building tool what is it like just building building app app scratch starting but I think last time it there was more stuff right even yeah I think last time we should like maybe risk management I can't remember it's been a while management third-party management mm-hmm yeah environmental section vote out listen to you

3:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just a second, I'm making things for this and just doing it on the mirror, on the side. Then, then, now, okay, and, can I share my screen with you?  Yeah, go for it. Okay, so, share now, share now, share now, okay, you see my screen now? Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so, basically, this is the thing you were doing, right, and maybe we can add a little box underneath, like, because people don't realize the focus and like to tell them what the focus was, was ease of use, user management, for large parks.

4:04 - A L
  I say like content, content suitability or something, like how I guess, because we were only focused on large companies then, but I think it's like ease of use.  But also we had kept going back and being like, are we at the right level? Right? Did we go too detailed?  We not go high enough, you know, like, so content is suitability, like I think it's always our thing. It's like, we always want to do more.  also want to do less, you know, so level of like simplicity or something, you know, simplicity. Yeah. But the main focus, like so, yeah, that main focus, you know, getting, getting overall, getting overall look and feel and feel, right?

4:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I'm thinking about the, the concerns or the pain. they brought up and I think if we it is true we focus on the looking field but there's different ways of looking at the focusing on the looking field right and our focus on looking field our approach to looking field was you know make it easy to understand at the glance easy to keep track of things easy to know what's in progress what's not progress so it's not the word looking the expression looking field might make them think he's about branding and he's about function yeah he's of use yeah functionality okay but not I think we shouldn't spend too much time because it's only one meeting on this I didn't think it's like well we have more but I was like I also want to get the environmental part but main focus is how to start testing the solution in the house.

6:00 - A L
  something like that. Next step controls. Okay. So, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, do we, yeah, how do we launch in a safe, should we say safe?  Use the word safe? I like the word safe because I think that's the word that they're thinking about.

6:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They're about their reputations and that kind of thing. And also launch seems like a big deal. For me, would be more comfortable to say, okay, we can test things.

6:45 - A L
  Yeah. Yeah.

6:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And we can give, we can even give them options, right? Like the Starbucks pricing model. So we, you can just  So, option A, so we prime them to say yes to something, and it's going be option C. So let's say the option C is really out there, so they'll never pick option C.  Option C all areas.

7:34 - A L
  I'm exaggerating.

7:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Option B, start using, this is a bit too much on the nose, everybody can see right through me, but you can calibrate it, just using with compliance department or something.

7:52 - A L
  I think what's the individually test, then two is like launch to other people, this one, individual test. Option A is individually test, you know, in like, um, which I worry a lot of them will say option A, like individually test it, like really test it out and send, um, and then like option B is like an option B, um, test with, test with a few friendly internal stakeholders perfect to get feedback and then option, you know, C will be, you know, wider group of wider group of test subjects, you know, much better phrase, yeah, test subjects.  My only worry is that they're all gonna do option A because of that, but this is like, but, yeah.

8:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What would be in it for them to make them choose option B?

8:54 - A L
  Um, maybe better buy in or like faster buy. in but it could also like if it goes bad it could be you know I think it depends on how they're you get more buy-in obviously but I think they're gonna want to test it out themselves right so that they don't feel like okay I actually understand this but individually option individually test and send as individually test and send out one week prior to you know bigger test you know what I'm saying like you could like test immediately with a few friendly immediately with a few friendly internal stakeholder to get back and really test out and then and then and two weeks later I would avoid I don't know how we feel about this but I would avoid uh commitment like promises at this stage because yeah it's difficult to keep track because things are keep popping up and maybe there's some feedback that forces

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because in my mind, I think a certain source of tension in the project is these expectations, right? Because people have been seeing some progress.  then these are software, and they don't know about the difficulties of software. They just work in their departments. They don't have to know.  this is every little delay as a very logic explanation. But we don't want to depend on them understanding those things, right?  So my suggestion would be to shift it slightly towards, you guys are a special group of friends, and you are beta testers.  And we want to be able to keep showing you things as soon as these things get developed. more about, let's talk about the kind of relationship we have, and less about, let's tell you what's the next date, right?  Of course, some people will have questions about the next date, and we need to. something to tell them, but that would put most of the emphasis like, oh, we have this conversation going back and forth.

11:18 - A L
  So what do you think? I think we should also have another one about like communication. How do we communicate with you?  Life with Kong ended up creating a slack because it was so hard to get them to access teams because they're all on Google.  Like I think HydroRain almost likely be on Microsoft. But like a question is like, yeah, communication, you know, document sharing, communication, planning for testing.  In case, yeah. Planning.

12:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to get a glass of water. I'll be back in a minute. I'm back. Yeah, I was just thinking testing feedback.

12:54 - A L
  We might be able to do something similar like option a and give feedback, slack. Option B is like 20-minute meetings, 20-minute meetings, every other week to general feedback.  Option C, you know, a one-hour walkthrough of the tool that you see with us to give immediate feedback. I can share my screen too so you can see.  Maybe I need to stop sharing. Yeah, maybe. So it's like this one, know, I don't even know if we need this picture.  Maybe it's too much because of my change, you know, so, like, I don't really test this that way. So, and then, like, so one is, know, option C, but then, and then I go to a next page of, and then we say communications testing feedback option A, individually test and give feedback on on SLEEMS versus email, so on this on this thing, can we just take maybe ten minutes to think about the testing strategy because I think things will become clear.

14:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so right now the system we have is that we develop things and every now and then we get on a meeting with them.  and we show them these things and they give us feedback. And we do this individually, right?

15:06 - A L
  Yeah.

15:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And so a couple of thoughts, they're not very structured. Something that could be interesting if this is possible, if to put them, to have these feedback sessions with all of them at the same time for two reasons.  For us, it takes less time, that's obvious. But also for them, it could be interesting to see how other companies are doing it, especially if they're young companies or young compliance officers.  I'm sure the hacker guys, maybe they don't want it, but the cooknight guys, because then there's also positions fortify as a community of people in attack to do this together.  Yeah. And also protects us against like, there was one person that's very, it's very, Yeah, picky and persuasive and you think oh my god it's really important but it isn't it's just that this person communicates in the way that's very compelling, but it doesn't mean to anyone else.  Yeah, we should get them out on the same group and we can structure these sessions. Yeah. You even out these things.

16:16 - A L
  And so, I guess my thing is more like, and when I made ABC, like here is this like knowing, having worked in their roles in house.  It's like, I want them to actually go into the app and like give feedback, know, and like, they can easily not do that if you don't constantly remind them because they're so busy right after they pulled into different things.  So like how do we actually get them to actually, you know, update deploy or send out and that's like either like okay we say we leave you alone but we expect you to do it and give us feedback.  Or like we you know we because you're so busy you're running around we just set 20 minute recurring meetings at least you remember oh yeah I need to go do something and you know do that.  Or like you're like I'm not going to have time so I'm just going to sit with you and kind of watch you you know like go in and.  like and give feedback right then so you're like kind of one and done you know through that so that's kind of like why I had put that in just so you have context of like I don't want it to be like I don't mind having I think it's a good idea to have a meeting like you know where everyone's together but I wanted that they had clicked through it first before we have that meeting because like that's my challenge is like right now every time we've been showing it to them they're like oh yeah that's great you know but until they've actually clicked it and see it okay I have trouble with this like this didn't make sense to me and whether or not that means like option A is actually respond to a survey that we send you every week you know on Slack like a 10 question survey so then they need to go and like what did you like about this what didn't you like and kind of then we get it kind of in that structured format that could be option A you know individually test and give feedback via via online survey online survey you know to collect the general feedback  early you know and walk through and then we can add something maybe around like you know in addition in addition after testing there will be a one-hour group feedback session with the other companies you know or something like okay I don't know it's like yeah I also don't want it to seem like really overwhelming for them right yes yes are you familiar with the function of customer success things yeah I know of it just because I worked at Microsoft and they had a huge one I don't know the details other than like there's somebody who kind of follows them all the time right like and make sure that they do do everything so yeah yeah okay yeah so to me that's kind of the mental model I have produced so we need to  I have some time now like we're going into that kind of thing is like how do we hand hold them how do we make sure that we make sure we get feedback and that we we can like yeah you know like customer success or something to call it customer success they'll probably recognize it okay I'll listen to a safe way for you let me get a little bit of-hmm and then talking and sharing Thanks.  Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Tess yeah Yeah So I don't know via online week via weekly We a weekly online server or no, we don't want weekly we don't want to set like something 20 minute meetings every other week 20 minute meetings together Maybe together feedback I don't want to with you testing with us to give immediate feedback Yeah, yeah Yes, and then do we say like estimated like time because people might be like so I like, oh my god How much is this gonna take me?  You know what I mean? Like should we do like five like what do you think five hours max? Five hours per month.  Yeah Like just to test it like all they need to do is like review and then like send it out, right?  Yeah, I think we need to have that number

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not sure if, I'm not being, it's not a, I don't know, I really don't know if I would put it on the slide, but we need to have that answer when they ask for sure.

21:11 - A L
  Yeah, so we shouldn't have put on the slide, but maybe we should say max 3 to 5.

21:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's difficult to hit 5, isn't it?

21:21 - A L
  Yeah, think so too, because I feel like it's like literally, it's these two parts, right? So it's like uploading a document, what we'll do, and then clicking through it, like, and then.  Okay, that's, okay, that's good.

21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  If we make that specifically steps, like when we say we want you guys to test the platform, what things we want you to do, if we make a list, you need to do this thing, this thing, and that thing.  Yeah.

21:45 - A L
  It's a bit more concrete, it's easier to say yes to, right?

21:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

21:49 - A L
  So not describe it in terms of the sections of the site, but the actions they need to do. So we need to, like, give us existing coliseum.  We're like, know, to upload, review existing, tell us, tell us which policies you would, you don't have, like would like us to upload you, because we have a list of policies here, right, that we've already generated.  Maybe we should actually not. should say, okay, review policies in the tool, edit policies as required, mark some as non applicable, and then, and then send to play to yourself or a friendly  the colleague, right, and then receive, and then accept, review the information, particularly for you and my employee photo. Something like that?  Yes, it's kind of not a lot of room, I can maybe make the suggestion.

23:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you could put like a caption underneath each picture, so this one is the admin view or whatever you want to call it, and the other is the  Why have you?

24:00 - A L
  Yeah, add 0, 0 for policies. Yeah, so is that okay then, because I also want to get to the other part, okay.  So then I'm going and then we go, okay. But then this is kind of repetitive, like, but maybe. This could just be, you see my screen, see your screen, yes.  I can move the important photo picture here, so.

25:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I wouldn't, I'm sorry, I would not do that because it's useful to have both of them at the same screen.  in, when you're talking and you say, oh, use the left side to send the policy, use the right side as an employee to approve a policy.

25:41 - A L
  Okay. Then, yeah, so then with this one.

25:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, so if you think about yourself in their shoes, I'm sure you've been there in the past. What would have made you say yes to participating in a test?  Um, in a test, yeah, I mean, yeah, what would, what would have made you say yes to, you know, participating?  I think a lot of these people need a digital tool, right?

26:17 - A L
  Because they're doing a lot of this manually via email and that. So they want to try. But that's a different thing, right?

26:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So one thing is like, why do you want Fortify? That's a set of answers. And the other thing is like, why would you take time out of your agenda or your calendar to help Fortify develop a better product?  Like some people really like to participate in new things. They don't need a lot of convincing. They're like the early adopters, the whole thing.  And some people are much more like political. They want to know that, oh, you'll invite me on your podcast.  Interesting. Then I want to be in, you know, this kind of thing.

26:53 - A L
  I think most of the people, if I understand it, they want to test it because they want a tool.  They're like, because they're, we're, getting something that they don't like the only reason you want to test you're not like necessarily testing it out of I think maybe the UK company is just testing it out of fun you know but I think that the rest of the ones that are actually doing this is like a job kind of thing they they want it to work right so testing it is like a step towards them ensuring that it works so that they can try to use it internally got it got it so in that respect what and what questions do you think they have while testing it like if you were in their shoes what questions would you be asking yourself while testing it I think it's like does this work can I actually launch this in the organization right if it like there's so many glitches along the way then it's like it's not ready for launch if it's a very smooth process and it goes well then it's ready for launch then the next step would be like okay what else do I need to be able to launch this you know like how far away are we from launching which is also I want to spend some time talking about controls with you too but that's kind of the feeling yeah for sure  But can we be specific?

28:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm going to give an example. Let's say I am Aberdeen forever. And I'm testing, not Aberdeen, because the Aberdeen is the one that is doing it just for Giggles.  OK, I'm, whatever, Accor. I'm a different company, Accor. And the questions I'm asking myself are like, maybe, oh, can I undo deploy?  What happens? Can I have access to my data? Will people need to have another login to use this? I probably have specific questions on my mind.  testing will answer, right? And if we can just put two or three of those general questions here, maybe people will see, oh, yeah, yeah.  This really answers the questions I want to know, right? Can I, is this easy to use? Can I keep track of my obligations?

29:00 - A L
  does it you know this but uh but i don't i guess my question is are these questions that you want to pose to them being like think about this when you test our thing or is it that's what you want them to come out of this what i'm thinking um like you know it could be like typical feedback we're looking for you you know from you yeah yeah okay that's a good bridge phrasing yeah so like what yeah all types very good feedback we are looking for just you know when i click this it doesn't work or something like that um i like this but um the button the button doesn't make sense here  you are missing a key feature for this to work the deployment like our like or something about like the process doesn't work the step-by-step function or something like this and there's there's a missing step or on this step there is a missing a step in this process and it's like you know and I guess you know you could say like also if you are able to navigate this yourself I guess yeah that's a like a question I don't like mark some as I've got up your own policy for testing you know because we have a create function there yeah are you able to navigate and  Understand this yourself. I guess the key question like what is our key question that we're looking for? you able to navigate this?  By yourself, is that our key question?

31:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I At some point I think it is but we we don't have an onboarding and we don't have a Lot of these tools they need some sort of training.  It's uncommon that people are just dropped into them and they get it, right? Yeah, and by Tracking them in at the throwing this at them without giving them that training.  We are not setting ourselves. Yeah, them saying, oh, this is really intuitive because so my my thinking on this would be to Focus less on how well explained it is.  Of course, they'll they'll say things. I don't understand this This thing will come up. But if we have specifically about that I think this will distort our perception of how good it is because we didn't give it a  But I think there's also, I really like these questions you put here, these examples, I would just sprinkle a few, a couple of them more positive, like, oh, this was really helpful because, oh my God, I wish this existed.

32:17 - A L
  I like this feature here the most, something like this feature here the most, I couldn't move this one, like this button, this makes sense here, yeah.  I really like this, it's like, if you had this, it would be great to see X in future iterations, like that, know, like that, or like, are we too negative?

32:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, it's good, there's always that. that point, people say that it's a real mark of a good experience when people would be mad if that thing went away.  But I think it's too soon to bring this in because people can see it yet. Yeah.

33:21 - A L
  Yeah. There's something like that. Yeah. And then would we send it like, like also like, should we create like a forms or something or like within our like teams or like somewhere where they can give feedback very like, you know, how would they give feedback or giving on via email or I guess this is like right here, right?  yeah, maybe this would be the feedback. So a test, I guess, and then this would be going here, guess, well, test with SF.  This is the one. And then how would we actually get the feedback from you? Right.

33:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I do think that we need to give the option for everyone to talk a little bit with us, because I mean I would make a long video but a lot of people don't know about long video.  A lot of them are too old. Yeah they wouldn't do it and some people really struggle and they some people are really they put in the efforts but they make like a huge document on the section on the corner left top right corner there's a red box they don't know how to talk about these things because that's actually would have been helpful or is it too hard it would be amazing but I don't think we'll get like a huge conversion rate on that also because lume for instance requires a browser extension oh yeah and then either it and all that yeah okay but if you get on a call with them and we have like a script and say how do you feel about this thing and oh yeah okay yeah so I think the survey is useful for some questions like  Like more general yes, no one-to-five sort of question.

35:03 - A L
  Oh, what do you think the difference between a and B should be then? Good point Mmm Yeah, yeah, we need to work on that because I don't know exactly you make it make an excellent point So individually with this two options a B Like we don't have to have like three.  Yeah, so I would remove B in that case I'll keep a and remove B Remove B. Yeah Thinking and really test out Yeah, because But then what would we what would like online survey and a call a few weeks ago?  or just give individual tests and give feedback via a 20-minute call. Yeah, it could be a 20-minute call.

36:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then inside the call, we just have to script and message the stuff and print out the papers and say yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.  And that's the firm. Yeah.

36:18 - A L
  Yeah.

36:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I think it was also good to remove it a few weeks later. think it's healthy. Yeah.

36:29 - A L
  It's a weekly, though, 20-minute call. They're going to be testing it out. I guess it's like, it doesn't take that long, so we have to move to control soon after for them to test it, right?

36:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I wouldn't commit to any specific schedule. I think it's, I mean, internally we can do it, but I think what we want to avoid is the feeling of, oh, we've promised these guys this thing.  This other thing that was unplanned, because we live in start-up land, happened. And now we feel committed to these guys that they don't understand the intrigue.  to start the plan. So just not create that commitment, alleviate that pressure. Yeah.

37:06 - A L
  Okay. No, I think these are good. So I think this is a, at least this is definitely good enough to be able to talk in our meeting.  And yeah, for sure.

37:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like we're prepared for it.

37:14 - A L
  But now we only have 20 minutes. Let me check up my schedule. I think this is a two hour session.

37:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, it's a two hour session.

37:21 - A L
  Okay, just kidding. Good. Perfect. Then we have, then should we move? Then should we move to the kind of planning for what needs to be done in the next round?  Because like, we're almost ready to launch this, but soon after we should launch the controls part of it. That's where I'm a little bit concerned.  A little bit on the governance side, but I think we've updated the design for that. But the environmental side, where we're not totally ready for it.  I was hoping more when you're on vacation, but I think that like walking through it with you and kind of the process that you understand it makes sense so that we can draw out something for it.  But Yeah, so let me pull on my desktop so I can also show you this here, see if it can make sense, and then maybe you can pull out a mural board and we can like discuss it.  Yes. Great, do you see my screen? I can see your screen, yes. So if we look at this part, just look at my document, I'll ignore the other ones, right?  So employee portal, risk management, controls, this is where we are. There's like kind of three, let me just hide this, like we're in the control section, so there's kind of three main things you need to do, and maybe this is the mural, kind of the three main things that we need, as well as we need to

40:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, the steps in themselves are more complex, but there are less of them, is that it?

40:08 - A L
  Exactly.

40:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

40:10 - A L
  Exactly.

40:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I'm just firing up Miro here on my thing, where's Miro? I'm going to be right back with some water.

40:20 - A L
  Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yes, and some of this we have created because there's the carbon reporting thing that was done but it wasn't it was done like a copy of a previous version that was more like a questionnaire not a step to walk through so I think as we kind of walk through it you and I show you the different parts that it makes up it will be clear like the process behind that.

42:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I share oh no you're sharing you're sharing your screen so I'll bring you to anyone with a link editor okay share the link I'm sending you the link here on the chat I don't know if you can see the chat on the meat thing and now I'm sharing the link.  Okay, you see my screen, so yeah, so if I understand it correctly, now we are focusing on controls for, I'll bring it to me, we are working on controls for the environmental section.  Correct? Yeah.

43:22 - A L
  Okay.

43:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And there's three types of controls for the environmental section, there's the carbon use data for the centers, there's a carbon reporting for offices, and there's an employee feedback.  Cool. And this, we have nothing on this, correct? use for the data centers.

43:52 - A L
  No, I think we need to do all of them, walk through the process. Okay, so tell me how it goes.

44:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm not familiar with the process.

44:01 - A L
  Yeah, so I sent an email back in the day. Let me see if I can find it. Let's see, it has three different directions on carbon reporting, carbon footprint.  Ross, I sent it to you on Thursday, January 16th. I'll send it to you now to put on the top card.  I found it. Hello, Roxana.

44:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you're back from vacation, is it breakdown of the free tools and the resource available to the provider? OK.

44:39 - A L
  So it's pretty much like the process would be like, depending on like a map out who your cloud providers are, right?  is it AWS? Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Is it somebody else, right? And then depending on which one, then you need to follow the directions and find your carbon number.  And then you need to put it into our. tool like manually put in for a tool until we figure out an API solution.  That's kind of the process for that. Then we track it and then we create some kind of you know thing that you track it over time and then you can report on it.  Okay, I'm just bringing that email into the mirror. My kids are like scavengers like they're jet lag from the US and I had I hid this bag of chips that I didn't think they found and like they found it.  I'm so annoyed. Have you seen the one with the left there?

45:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I went over there and it's like I'm like Have you seen the one from a crow's eating fake food?  No. Crow's I think it's crows how you pronounce it right?

45:49 - A L
  I'm not sure.

45:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is that? Oh yeah, yeah, crow, yeah. So they see they know others are looking so they hid fake food in fake places and then  The other one is going there and then they go to their own place. Oh gosh. Yeah, that's what I need to you need to do that It's very smart.  Okay, so I got the email here bring everyone to me and You basically said Find out provider Okay Navigate there Yeah, and then I it's almost like is it like if you were to do it in some kind of UX UI design It's like, you know Click out of the three providers you might have but the problem is it might be multi-cloud, right?

46:33 - A L
  So depending on what they pick then okay, you picked. I don't know if we want to go that far, right?  But like, you know, you picked Microsoft here the direction for Microsoft you pick Google here the information or we just say these are all three, know And VP format.  These are the three of these formats, right?

46:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so there's I think there's a little bit of a range of usefulness, right? So if I have no  If I've never done this, just the fact that you're telling me that I can find it on my cloud provider is already useful, right?  So this is already good. And then you tell me where to find it or how to find out what my cloud provider is and we are going up the scale of usefulness, right?  And there's a horizon where eventually everything is automated, which is very useful and not for now. But I'm saying this because just by telling them how to do it, even if the instructions were, figure this out and then write a number here, this would always be useful, especially for first time, okay?

47:38 - A L
  I think so too. So I was like adding some more a follow-up email that kind of explains it. But yes, yeah, I agree.  I agree. So like even knowing about that there is an option to look it up. And we need to test this too because I'm not sure this is like, this was a chat-to-be-team version of how you do it.  then my... soft came back in that additional message saying that both Azure and usage available to end users in their own tenant through a dedicated Power BI connector.  there's an API that are allowed for this. It's currently only available in preview to end customers owning the tenant who would need to request access.  But yeah, this is an API. So this was when I went back to Microsoft and I said, hey, these are the directions I found from you for Microsoft.  And he was like, well, they're kind of half correct if this is actually how you would do it. But I think in the meantime, we can still draw something out while we're testing it.  Yeah.

48:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And also everything that relates to integration is always a little bit flimsy because they can change it, right?

48:39 - A L
  Yeah.

48:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Microsoft, Amazon, Google, they pick both the ticket here. Yeah.

48:51 - A L
  You see it, right?

48:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it has some Okay, this is not exactly here, but you could, okay, and then it looks like Google.  There's this megawatts, I don't know. Yeah. I would.

49:26 - A L
  And then like date, like date, and then megawatts, so you have like kind of a snapshot. But this is the question is like, I'm sure there's a good question, like, do you deploy this?  That's actually a good question. Like, okay, so I'm the project manager here, like, I'm in Cognite, I'm Roxana, but I'm not actually the person that is going to find this information, it might be IT.  So does IT have access to our portal via the employee portal, you know, to like see this is what you need to do and input it, or is it that they would have to be like an admin for this section, and then they follow this direction?  then put it in. Or can you deploy this form to somebody else? you know what I mean? Yeah, I get it.

50:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For this version, I would not deploy it to someone else. But there's something we can do here which is relatively easy because email is the backbone of office work, right?

50:28 - A L
  So we could have something like an email them once they and then they get a link to directly to this page to fill it in.  Exactly.

50:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or something, maybe not a link directly to this page because that messes with the message. Yeah, it would be a link to a pop-up page.

50:45 - A L
  We talked about that was a net actually. Yeah, let's do that. Like link to a pop-up page where somebody else can fill it in.  Yeah, that's a good idea. And then you can track it.

50:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Input, I don't know if that's the name.

50:58 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

51:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But they should not be dependent on the IT guy doing this, right? If the IT guy is, like, uncooperative and you should have a way of...

51:17 - A L
  You kind of need somebody to go into the system to be able to pull it, though. So whether it's the IT guy or somebody else, somebody has access to the tenant.  So, like, I don't know how I might be able to do it, but I'm not sure I have access rights, but I'd have to ask Ivan to go in and try to figure out, you know, who it is.  No, no, I get it, I get it.

51:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  My point is that we still need the web interface because maybe the IT guy just replies to your email, oh, yeah, Google is a thousand...  I don't know, a thousand to an hour. But he'll never put it on the platform because it can be bothered, but you just go there and write it down.  So there's an email. of subjects help this is pre-written right with x and this is a bit primitive for us to use another tasks we need to do x instructions and just reply to me I would not put this not for this version I would not make this like oh just reply to this email and 45 will automatically extract that's possible in the future for sure but I wouldn't do it now yeah  Yeah, I think that's kind of it, right?

53:06 - A L
  Yeah, and then I guess the question is like, okay, they input it in, I guess then it would go to the dashboard section that we haven't really created and like in terms of visualization of it and later on board reporting, but I don't know if we need that part yet on this part, you know, collecting the information.  Like, like, you know, like the information like on this last one that you did a megawatts, you know, place of input, blah, blah, blah, there be on the bottom, like some kind of summary.  You know, like, so at least they have like a summary page of like, you know, this is what your thing is or does that put into our dashboard page that we haven't done or in the temporary when we haven't done the dashboard page.  We have some kind of like summary page that like I'm thinking like we put this in but why like most likely it's because they're going to report it or they're going to want to have some kind of graph that can try, you know, look at the trend over time.  So but the question is, in our MVP version, like, where do we put that and then, you know, should we just maybe.  That just goes in the, you know, that whole page above the compliance map that we haven't built, which is all the dashboard, you know?  That would go over there, right? This is just it.

54:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so there's a principle that I like, which is if we make it screenshotable, it is already helps people.  And as we move, as we refine the tool, then we get PDF reports and stuff like that. So to make this the V1 or maybe the V0 and make it screenshotable, you can make this thing, this thing, total here.

54:41 - A L
  Yeah. And that's because then then we will see.

54:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's well, we see, we see it's a we see that we see the numbers coming up, right?

54:53 - A L
  So Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. So at least like there's a table that they can copy or something like that.  Yeah. On that. Yeah. Yeah.

55:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay So, okay, so total and you want table Transline so this is V zero plus V one plus, right?  Yeah, and V three V two plus. I don't know something Okay So this would probably work for cloud providers To have like a first version of that, right?  Yeah Change this Yeah Cloud and now carbon reporting for offices

56:01 - A L
  Let's do it in a color.

56:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I never won any calligraphy awards, as you can see. So maybe the same logic applies, because if you have more than one office, you have an ad location, right?  And then we have some sort of...

56:35 - A L
  Yeah, because there's an office location to write, because how would we do that? Yeah, exactly, per office, because there will be different offices that have to be one.  So yeah, we need to add locations, you know, like that. So my question... No, actually, for a total cloud usage, they should be able to find that in one central...  location for total cloud usage like you'd be able to find like you know Portugal has this and this more for the the the second one that we did like the individual carbon reporting that one won't be central yeah yeah okay sorry you haven't lost you're already at the good air okay i'm confused that where you were oh sorry because i'm using on my ipad and in my computer that yeah so you're now at carbon reporting for offices okay correct yes so if i had if i have several locations yeah i need to add different offices even if they're in the same country right yeah yeah you do so how do people find this out so yeah like and i could show you what um we started doing maybe on our figma right because we do have some drawings on this already from from figma um where's the figma let me share my screen  I don't see your film, okay, now I see it, yes, okay, carbon reporting. And I'm not, yeah, so yeah, so this one I think it made, like this, he took it off of our original carbon reporting one, this is Romeo's new design, right?  And this doesn't make sense, I think that your question makes more sense, locally or internationally, this is additional, our question.  So it should be actually like either country drop down, or you just like you had it, like, you know, with country, do you operate, right?  And then there's like, The questions is like, so I would change this one to match yours. And then the other one is what's following described or office situation you own or rent an office space or do you rent the co-working space?  And then each of these. Yeah, like, you know, and this is again, like. And then, you know, then you go through different questions, right?  Like electricity, gas, this and then and then step one, I guess, step two. Yeah. And then you add your electricity bills here.  Energy consumption. And then, yeah, like, so we kind of go through the questions actually here. I think it's the first one doesn't make sense.  And I think like these are going to be have to send to like five different people. So I think and actually this step should maybe be the first step that you mentioned, you know, mentioned.  And then it's like, employ this questionnaire to the to the right people to fill in. You know, the company have any vehicles?  No. So it's and then remote employees. And then waste. like, so these are kind of the things that they could be filled in, but I'm also wondering if this is overwhelming because it's like sitting through all of this and like maybe it should be actually, you know, you could you can fill in one and then be done and then fill in two and then be done and then fill in three, you know, like, rather than the whole thing, but this is all the information that you need to kind of collect and then succeed and then some kind of dashboard on that.  So, step one, two, three, four, so there's only five steps, it's not a lot, but I'm not sure everyone would be able to sit through this in one sitting, you know what mean, because you need to go and collect your electricity bills, right, and then you need to, yeah, so and then some of them, like, you know, what type of energy source that your company use for heating, like if I'm renting this space, I'm not going to know, you know, immediately I'm going to have to go in and email somebody.  and try to find this out so I wouldn't necessarily be able to sit in this in one sitting so I don't know if it's better to like break it into five separate ones that you can do in different times but um quite open or we just start it like this and then let them try to do it you know.

1:01:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh okay so I have a couple of questions um let me organize my thoughts. I know specific order I agree I don't think people will be able to fill this in in one sitting this is this is normal and people are used to being victimized by SAP Aruba and stuff like that so this will be amazing so that that's okay and as long as people can save the progress right and if they can keep track of I've started this somewhere I don't know what it is now yeah oh yeah it's there this is important but it's okay if people cannot do it in one sitting yeah the other thing is if at the start of the process we allow them to  get the preview of all the questions they'll need to answer especially there's some people work like this they'll just print out that list they figure that that's out and then they'll come back to this and do it in one sitting right the different profile so just by adding kind of a checklist at the start we can already help significantly help a specific kind of profile that's probably relatively common in corporate world so my point is not a problem if they cannot do it in one sitting it just shouldn't be a surprise it's very frustrating if oh yeah I think it's done and then now there's a question that I'll need three weeks to answer at least like right here I like because what we had before like the version before Romeo touched it which is like one really long like it looked like one page but it's like a lot of you know some questions so he's kind of built it so there's only two or three questions in it and I like how on top so you can kind of see but I can see it how it would be misleading because it like you know you're

1:03:00 - A L
  Okay, I could do this it's only five steps and then you go in there like oh no, but I need to have this one for this one before I you know can I go to this one to this one?  So that's why it's a little bit, but I'm quite open and I think it's good that we already have this design So it'll be a lot faster, you know for that that control, but it's more of like Putting it together into a process that makes sense when they get this And and for instance The manufacturer has shared my screen.  Can you can you copy that?

1:03:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, you are in the figma nevermind The figma one that Romeo has made.

1:03:31 - A L
  It's just called a carbon accounting reporting So I think you should have access to it, but I don't know I could copy the link.

1:03:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I do I do I do I have access don't worry about it So Here Okay, this is just experimenting right we're thinking out loud The same sorts of Premise with it with a cloud thing that we have several locations and you add  location one location two and all of those things correct. Yeah. So as you click on add location it could I don't like this option actually.  Yeah. Sorry this is confusing because it's still here but I'll take it out take it out get out. So probably it could just come here and this is a preview of those five boxes at the top right and they are like general information energy consumption vehicles.

1:04:36 - A L
  and then the topics I guess in each it's kind of like could it be like in our app like risk assessment has like these are the different typical topics or okay yeah energy comes something yeah with vehicles yeah I like that.

1:04:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know so something like this right and this thing as a status right so this thing could be done.

1:05:00 - A L
  or not done okay in progress or something like that yeah that's a good way so then would those be five different forms then because the way that we have it or they just no it could be the same form it just clicks into different parts of the same form maybe precisely precisely because because then we can reuse what the Romeo already has we only change the the the starts yeah change starts and also if I'm in the progress process of adding a location here so here oh yeah but how does that work because in each individual like just like if I'm the group admin and then like India fills in theme one you know 50 percent and then China fills in theme one 80 percent I guess that maybe has to be by location underneath like where you have the the electricity arrow and the car you would have location and progress I heard them I've heard every word I'm not sure I follow can you  Yeah, so I think that like if you think about where you just drew like the car and the water tap and the electricity boat thing, how like, when you say percentage done, how does that work if you have multiple locations.  So if you have like, you know, Portugal only has done through one, you know, 100%, but China has only done the 150%.  You know, how do you manage that? Also same with the charts, right? Like when you put it in, when people answer the questionnaire, they need to answer by location, I guess, so that you're able to separate it out.  So something like, and I'm wondering if something, we kind of did something similar in Retellinor that we need to kind of break it down by location on that.  And then maybe it means underneath the car, the water tap and the electricity boat, have like location one, location two, location three, and then you can see, yeah, like, and then you can see underneath.  So you kind of get an overall summary of who you need to chase to get it. Correct.

1:07:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the thing is, I believe, so for location one, let's say location one is Norway, we know that they have done three out of the five sections.  Okay, location one is not complete, right? And then we have location two, and location two is really far behind and there's no energy, there's no car, there's no water, nothing.  It's even like this an automatic leaderboard, right? Yeah, like that.

1:07:41 - A L
  And the one thing we need to add into that step is like you add a location and add a contact person because they're gonna have to email it to somebody in the organization and then that person is going to have to go in somewhere and then only access their information.  You know what I mean? So it's like add location and contact person. Because if you add a location, then that's the question.  It's like, OK, I add gel to be in charge of Portugal. Then I send you, I add you. then do I send you to that second screen?  And then you're in there, and you're filling it out for your own country, and you don't see anybody else's country.  And then it compiles into the first screen. I'm not sure. But there needs to be some kind of like.  Oh, I get it.

1:08:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I get it. So I would not have different country managers feel like the same information. I would have a.

1:08:33 - A L
  You you have to, though. You could like it's what we've seen actually was the net. And what I've seen experience is like, it can't be the same person in group because it's like you need to have like local admin.  Also, some of the stuff like in Germany is in local language. If you need to find their electricity bills and that, it's often sitting with like a local office manager.  There's access to like, you know, their lease payments and their different things. So this has to be like, be able to be sent to somebody locally and they have to be able to access their own form.  room to fill it in and then somehow we need to compile that information or have overview of who's where they are and in the progress for.

1:09:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. I need to organize something here. Okay so there's two different scenarios right? So so there's this person and there's this person okay.  A fills information for different locations because they're all in the same country and they are a country manager. Okay so this is probably easy to do.  Yeah and this person has location A on country A and they have location B on country B, right? for this, the A person is relatively easy, but the B person is difficult because they have a specific person over there, right?  Yeah. And they need to give access. Yeah, and that's most likely the case is gonna be.

1:10:19 - A L
  Okay. Is that like, it's like, and I know the compliance people are gonna be like, they're already pushing back on some of this comments.  It's like they need the organization to take ownership of some of these, you know, they can be the coordinator and I kind of get all the information, send it in, but the local, and they do the same way if I worked in house too, like if I have to go in and like, like I think it's one that you can go in and ask them to provide this information, but that's like the whole tool thing, right?  Like ideally they'll update it into the tool and then you'll have this information that you can calculate. So they'll give you the information in the tool, you'll have the information and then be able to work from that.  Okay. So I understand the use case and make sense to me.

1:11:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's quite a little bit more complex in terms of access, privileges, privileges, and stuff like that. But we can figure it out.  So could this be inside of the employee portal for that specific? So let's say that. Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1:11:19 - A L
  And it's the same thing with the first one, to be honest. If you need to send it to the IP person into their thing, and they need to fill it in.  Ideally, everything stays within the tool. I know it'll make it more complicated, but it was, yeah.

1:11:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, so let's say that we are now on the employee portal, OK? Yeah. Employee portal. Yeah. And this is the employee portal of the IT guy, OK?  And this is the employee portal. of HR.

1:12:05 - A L
  Okay.

1:12:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So this, this guy will have some tasks as one, as two, and HR will have different tasks, test three, test four, and the guy, this is the menu, like 45, 45.  And they fill in the stuff. Let's say that HR is filling some stuff about, I don't know, they, and this guy is filling up some stuff about cloud.  Okay. Yeah. So the employee portal acts as the catch-all thing for all the tasks they need to do, right?  Yeah. this person is the compliance, and they send tasks to both of this, right?

1:12:52 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

1:12:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So this is the model of the interaction.

1:12:56 - A L
  Yeah. Okay.

1:12:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it goes into there, like, like, you know,

1:13:00 - A L
  Jiu designated for IT. you get this in your IT portal, but maybe somebody else doesn't have it because they didn't, it wasn't designated to them.

1:13:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

1:13:14 - A L
  So we have to find some way like if somebody assigned you something that it goes into a task that you need to do in your employee portal, I could be like check off policy, check off this fill in carbon reporting data, you know.  Yeah, yeah.

1:13:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me create a new. Just organize the new otherwise we won't understand it in a couple of weeks.  And we will need is Okay, so this is something we need to figure out. When we solve this, we solve for all of them, and then we should not...  Yeah, and I could also go for G. you know what I'm saying?

1:14:28 - A L
  it can work for G, because if you think about... My bad, my bad.

1:14:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I said E, I mean if I... point, okay, yeah, task one.

1:14:36 - A L
  Yeah, exactly. Any kind of task you send around that the compliance officer sends that it could be captured within our system, yeah.

1:14:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, okay. And so a task, okay, this is something we need to figure out later, because there's several components to a task, like what needs to be done, what kind of thing it is, who is responsible for it.  deadlines, tracking.

1:15:03 - A L
  Yeah but we could also spend some time looking at that because I do think that's gonna be a key component of the success of our tool is that we keep everything in the tool that they can actually manage so if we want to like look at that first before we go to the rest of the carbon I think that's also fine because that I see that as a possibility for the G that we have created let's say like there's a company that like only five people work with the government officials you know then those people should have access to like you know you need to have a certain task or you need to look at the you need to submit the government official portion so I think if we think about that that general flow I think it's good too.

1:15:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think these are the basic elements of the test.

1:15:54 - A L
  Yeah.

1:15:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right. What, when, why?

1:16:02 - A L
  Yeah, and assign like you could be responsible for a test that is assigned to me right.

1:16:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, this happens in the yeah, yeah, okay Good And then a sign yeah So whenever we create the task it needs to be compressed into this sort of thing and that task shows up somewhere on the employee portal And yeah, that's probably out.  There's also status. We need to know the status of the test.

1:16:33 - A L
  Yeah, so there's a both Yes, no status and also percentage status Yeah, that's our and then like yeah, yeah exactly if it's overdue or if it's not and that Yeah, this is actually a key part like I know that some of the pilot people have asked because then they have a little bit More flexibility on other tasks that they might have outside of our tool That they can send it to somebody to do.  Yeah, okay

1:17:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But we also need a way to check tasks. Check the status of tasks, I guess, right? And this means also that, for sure.  like, OK, people, my Apple Pencil sometimes. Come on. Oh, yeah. So status, people, you know. So let's use an example.  Let's say you are interacting with different teams, right? One of them is HR. And HR is yellow, and you have some tasks for yellow.

1:17:50 - A L
  Yeah.

1:17:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's over here. And you are also interacting with some tasks.

1:17:58 - A L
  Finance, like finance.

1:18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a finance yeah something like this right so you need to be you need to see you need to see the tasks of these different people right yeah and so you can ask them to you know move along and then the HR person they only see their own tasks yeah and the and the finance person they only see their own yes yeah exactly and that would be like an employee portal I guess but in the way that we have it now the admin person would see it in the dashboard area which we haven't created too I think or maybe we have asked maybe we don't have it let me let me pull up my screen really quick and go into the app to check or maybe we need to add it to it actually

1:19:00 - A L
  Task requiring action. Okay, maybe it's not. I'm just looking at them. Hold a second. We share really quick to my screen.  Yeah, sure. Uh, Here. Like There should actually probably be another one. Because this is like task requiring action for them, right?  Like you need to, they need to deploy the conflict of interest. They need to follow up on missing training.  They need to upward the board. And then these are like a task required tasks from the organization. So like, you know, this is when they're sitting or maybe there's all need to go into one.  And then there could be one called task assigned to others. You know what I mean? Uh, yes, there's. These two should be combined probably right and then and then a new one being like tasks assigned to others.

1:19:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, yeah, there's something in that direction. I would like to explore it a little bit more, but yeah, it's something in that direction for sure.

1:20:00 - A L
  Like when you think about carbon reporting or any of the other stuff that we pull up, it would go over here You know like that that one that we're looking at so it's something like the the visualization of it would be here, but um, yeah, okay So yeah Sorry, I think I interrupted you.  No, so that's what yeah, so we do need something like tests Assigned to others because a lot of your job in my compliance and sustainability is like sending out people and asking them to do stuff, right?  Mm-hmm.

1:20:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so Okay, so there's a couple of different things and I think this is really useful to To to to slice I want to use a different words.  I'll call it obligations. Okay. And so obligations For Okay, I'm just using the name So, in terms of obligations, you have some, some of the obligations are, they depend only on you, 100% own, and some of them are shared, right?

1:21:23 - A L
  Yeah. Example, carbon reporting, just to make this a bit more tangible.

1:21:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then there's some of them that are your own, and yeah, you will, you can do it independently.

1:21:40 - A L
  Yeah. I think some of them will want that because they'll be tasked outside of our tool that they want to just put all of their tasks in that they might be responsible for, not in our tool, competition, right?  I remember one of them saying, like, well, I want to be able to manage our competition things out here, you know, so.  need others to finish okay and okay so let's give it a couple of examples just two things that I can finish independently are for instance some kinds of reporting that I have all the information I need right a policy for I send out well there are like some of this is what I yeah like you need to have approval process which we don't so like I would say you know when you say compliance officer CO it's called like I think called project manager to think about that right so think about a project manager they're gonna have some tasks that they need to do themselves they're gonna need some tasks they need to chase other people for there's you know like there's a good task that they they manage we're gonna need approval for so it's typical project manager role like a lot of compliance there's are just meant to like  coordinate, a lot of the role of a compliance officer is coordinating all of these different tasks and that's what's been some of the trouble in the industry is that it's been very manual.  So it's like I'll send an email here to you, I'll send an email here, I'll send the forms over here, I'll send a training over here and then I'm juggling trying to chase up all of these different things not knowing the status of any of them.

1:23:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, so, okay, let's use that rule of the project manager. I just want to put some meat on this on this framework to see if it fits.

1:23:42 - A L
  So I don't even know if it's like the 100% owned, it's just kind of like within your responsibility for some that you can do yourself, some you need approvals from others in order to finish, others you need information from others to finish.  know, it's like you can do it yourself and it's done. need anybody to do it, you need to send it to somebody to say that it's okay, you know, like, approval process, like, I can create my own policy, that's fine, but I need someone to approve it, that it's okay to send out, right?  Like, that's one. And then there's another one is like, I can't like, I don't want to create the policy because I'm not responsible for competition, but I want to send it to somebody and make them, you know, do it so then I can, I can have it and then, and then send it for approval and move forward, you know, like, so yeah.

1:24:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think the challenge for this is where do we draw the line? Because it's very, it's very easy to, because it's very easy to imagine that this just goes on forever, like a fractal.

1:24:44 - A L
  Yeah.

1:24:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And it pulls us away from the core.

1:24:51 - A L
  Yeah, no, I agree. I think that we can almost like, but I think the simplest version is like the best is like just the sign it and the status yes or no.  closed you know you don't need to like go into a huge like deep thing but it's more like a mental map of like four compliance officers like I assigned it to all of these people is it done yes or no you know like and I leave it leave it there you don't need to be like I want the approval through here and like I need to track the approval on that it was like a simple task management and then like the only ones that we go into more deep are the ones within our tool maybe like that you know like that that can be like kind of a hybrid it's just like no no absolutely I think that we are you know mapping out the terrain for them to make a simplified picture of it so I'm gonna I'm gonna let me explain you how I'm thinking about this so if we have a screen where I see where I see all the tasks right yeah both my tasks and that I have assigned to others yeah I'm I'm pretty sure that it's useful to know if

1:26:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  to separate things that I can just finish on my own and things that I need to chase people around for, right?

1:26:07 - A L
  Yeah, that's hard to make a blanket rule though. Because some companies with the compliance officer, sustainability officer have a lot of authority and they can make a decision.  Like in Heathrow Lane, I think they'll just let her do whatever she wants and same with them in Akkar bio marine.  But then there's others like Akkar Horizon or like Akkar carbon capture where they won't be able to make a move.  It's just based on where they put compliance and sustainability in the organization.

1:26:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1:26:35 - A L
  Yeah, Why don't we assign some of the tasks? in our app, we have like, conflict of interest form, complete blah, blah, blah, blah.  Can we also have multiple people? So then like in those tasks that we've already designated, it's not only you, you can assign that task to somebody else and then somehow see it.  So then it's not like creating new tasks. I don't know, I'm thinking out loud here, but I do think that there is a portion where some of  will ask, I need to chase up this email that's outside of our thing. know, like, the board has asked me to do some additional research on this.  I need to, like, know, send out a task to somebody in turn to follow up on this research. You know, like, there will be a little bit of task management needed in there.  But just, like, how simple can we do it? I think it's going to be the question. I'm going to run to the restroom.  you you

1:28:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank you.

1:28:57 - A L
  you. Thank

1:29:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's role-play this for a You have sent me, I'm an IT guy. Yeah. And we will go through this tree and figure out the different roles.  So now the tree is red and IT, cloud, whatever.

1:29:53 - A L
  Yeah.

1:29:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we start here and you need to know what's the cloud conception. and reporting and this is a shared possibility because you cannot solve this entirely on your own.  Yeah. So we need to bring to this place which means you create create a task for me.

1:30:17 - A L
  Some of these tasks I would say are already created right because we created it in our tool. Yeah. So they just need to deploy it right like so there are some tasks that we create and others that they all want to create themselves out like that are not in our tool.  Yeah. For sure.

1:30:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. But just just a shape of the shape of the test because these are the tests that you create for me or that exists for me.  And now let's use a different a different path which is now you want to approve a new policy.

1:30:53 - A L
  New policy.

1:30:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you are responsible for that but you cannot do it on your own. is the RACI matrix, right?

1:31:04 - A L
  Responsible, accountable.

1:31:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you're responsible for this, but you need my help to finish because you need my approval, okay? So this is the path that this task takes.  And just the third case to really drive each home. And now there's a task of a gift. I need to, I'm a regular employee, no specific leadership role, and I need to fill in my yearly conflict of interest form, okay?  Yearly form, okay? So you have a responsibility for collecting these things every year.

1:31:49 - A L
  You need me to finish.

1:31:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the way I think it's not about approval, is about me just finishing, right? the thing is, all of these colorful arrows,  They show up upstream to you because you are always involved with them, right? But we need to separate them between tasks that are your own and tasks that are...

1:32:15 - A L
  Yeah, you're missing maybe like the green one can also go to just finish on your own. All the way the one, all the way the left independently finished.  There could be like a line from 100% to there, but yeah.

1:32:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh yeah, so okay, let's create a situation where there's something you can do on your own. There could be a policy itself, like you can decide on a policy, people don't care too.

1:32:38 - A L
  the green line, my point is it can just go also to the independently finished line. Yes, yes. Just go there from there, yeah.

1:32:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have different streams that feed into the full task view of what you need to do, right? Not task, obligation view of what you need  So, we have obligations. We need a view of these obligations and we have like a bunch of them, right?  bunch of them. And some of them are owned. And some are others, right? And when it is the case of others, let's say I opened this task.  Task for other.

1:33:33 - A L
  We need to know it relates to a certain obligation.

1:33:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This task is downstream from an obligation. And something needs to be done and status is whatever, okay? 50%, right?  And then you pastor the person that needs to do this and send them an email. Right? we have right in our tool like if you think about we send out a policy for somebody to fill in and then you know you have the deployment statistics and then you you have the list of then all of the people you need the pepper right mm-hmm yeah so okay so now we go back to to this thing where is it to this we go back to this thing of the of the different tasks right and if I am now assume that I am the IT guy okay I'm the the IT guy IT okay and this task shows up on my employee portal right and when I send this email the email goes  Okay, so now to me it seems that we have a general task management flow for to connect between the obligations of the project manager and the different tasks that make up those obligations.  So for instance for certain obligations you'll have hundreds of tasks, right? For instance, let's say that you have an obligation of every year you collect the conflict of interest form and your company has 200 people.  That obligation is made up of 200 tasks.

1:35:38 - A L
  Yeah and that's why we have it in kind of 200 tasks, like one big task, yes, and that's why we have it in our in our app, right?  Like we have like tasks complete off and then when you go into that section wherever it is there's a deployment status and then they have their names and like follow-up so that's kind of how to make it easy for you to follow up on that task.

1:35:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly, so by by checking that thing you can quickly see if you are you know, likely to hit it.

1:36:05 - A L
  Good.

1:36:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what we've learned from this exercise is that there are many different tasks that can, as an employee, some tasks all employees will have.  For instance, the conflict of interests, gifts, political exposed person, training, some of these tasks that everybody has. But then you have, like, special functions or you have tasks that are related to a specific function, like the IT guys might get the cloud thing, HR, EI, the IE.  So we have obligations, tasks, and... Ad hoc or something like that.

1:36:54 - A L
  Yeah. Or tasks general and tasks ad hoc.

1:36:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. OK, so we need to find ways to place these on the platform. Which I think we are there.  It's just that this was a little bit fuzzy for me, now it's a bit more clear. Got it. With this, it's funny that it keeps zooming out.  Do you want to, we have some time still, do you want to think about the invoices?

1:37:31 - A L
  Yeah, I guess it's more like, you know, what do you think is? I'm just thinking also in terms of like kind of usage of this platform, right?  Policy is precision training. They'll want that to be the use it controls. I think it could be good. Like maybe that can come first before and we're not so far away from it.  And then the task manager will probably need to come soon after. After you have that, you can kind of work the app off without like the other parts of it, right?  So I guess. So my question along the way around, yeah, maybe we should just finish the other one at the third one because the third one isn't that complicated.  It's more of like just the feedback loop that you need to have from employees. And it's kind of like one of the static ones that conflict of interest or, you know, ones that will be in the employee portal and then they need to fill it in.  So you just like review it once you agree with like launching this ad hoc questionnaire that, you know, we're occurring questionnaires people need and then they fill it in.  So that's the third one.

1:38:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so employee feedback, just to make it easier, I'll bring it here and we probably have, we need to, go ahead, go ahead.

1:38:43 - A L
  No, no, I'm just going to find that document. It's like the ugliest document, which I haven't, I need to think about how to make it pretty, I'm wondering how do you see it will go in?  And I tried to drop the document in here, but, It usually loads, but just takes a little bit.

1:39:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, yeah.

1:39:02 - A L
  There it is. And then there's one more.

1:39:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  actually don't have it in here.

1:39:12 - A L
  But it's called Employee Suggestion for Improvement. There's a third one called Employee Suggestion for Improvement, I haven't really created yet.  But it's very generic. Is this a screenshot? These are documents I just dropped in. But one of them have multiple pages, and the other one is just a page read.

1:39:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's right.

1:39:38 - A L
  So one is like incident reporting. So one is like the bottom one with incident investigation. Again, incident investigation. Or incident reporting.  Incident reporting. And then the other one And it is like document change management request. I don't think it's a stupid document, but that's kind of a document change request, yeah, on that one.  And then there should be a third one that's kind of, I think this, what I would also do is like, actually I'm gonna do this, document change employee feed back.  I'm just gonna call it that. And then I can change the document. Let me just do that right now.  me see if I can do this. I wonder if I can combine it with some general feedback one, because then we don't need a separate document can change because nobody's gonna really request a document change.  but these are all just keep it because it's so it'd be headed in request and then there So it's like kind of three and then these would be like the you know, so these three would be the ones in the employee portal right you know when it goes like conflict of interest you know that instead you would have these three and then these three would probably then need to go to you know they all go to an approver.  And the approver approver to review you know respond or assign a task right because it might be like okay document document change.  request somebody asked for document change like I don't like your environmental policy it sucks I want you to change this then the reviewer needs to say like the reviewer needs to go like I agree okay we'll change it or like no I don't agree don't change it you know and then they give some kind of feedback or they go I yeah I agree I need to change let me send this out to change and then aside a task for that but just so I understand these employee feedback questions sorry firms yeah they are inside the employee portal or they are sent deployed from within the 45 admin view they are in they are they are in the employee portal I'm trying to find the so you know how the employee portal has that bottom section that says you know occurring like reoccurring controls where it says like um yes yes yeah so that's where it would go for the environmental right  Because you filter it, those are the ones right now for G. But if you were to filter it for E, then you'd only have three.  So you wouldn't have conflict of interest, government officials, whatever, blah, blah, blah. those are all G controls. The E controls would be this, is that you're getting information feedback from that.  And if you wanted to try to, could be like volunteering or something. Or something like that. I don't know if you want, you can add like a third one, just a fourth one to make it fun, like for employees.  Actually, you said, because the likelihood of them and using these top three document change requests, incident reporting, an environmental suggestion is like, right, like zero, not right.  Nobody's really going to fill it in, but you need that for the ISO process. But maybe they're more likely to fill in like volunteering or suggestions, they might improve suggestions.  Then you could put in that or that. be an S side in social. But like, you can just at least minimum of these three that we would need designed and made.  And I'm not sure if these are the forms and I'm not sure if Romeo has started designing these or not, but that was kind of the meaning of those.

1:44:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the carbon used for data centers is within the admin view.

1:44:46 - A L
  Yeah, or like, and then like so the car, like the bottom part, you know, where the pink ones are that's where this part would go.  like then the, the, if I were assigning you to do the carbon thing it would go into in progress on the top underneath that guy with that big pencil.  You know what I mean? Like those would be individual tasks that would be assigned to you. So in your employee portal, it would look the same as everybody else's, but you would have an additional one underneath that guy with the big pencil.  And that would say like fill in, you have been assigned the tasks are assigned to you.

1:45:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Let's do it. we will need some sort of a toggle or a filter to shift between. Yes. Yeah.

1:45:49 - A L
  Or we need to think about how to like show them in a form like my, you know, there's a section called my forms on the left in the column, know, because I feel like there's going to be so many.  So is it better to move into like, move that whole section of the dropout into my forms and then there's like a better design of my forms so you can toggle between them, you know?  What the problem?

1:46:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, I understand your point. What I'm thinking is Especially for a first version, yeah, I would make like the homepage be a place where I can find anything, even if it's not very pretty, because then people can use control f and find things on the page.  So what I'm thinking is ideally in the future, if you have a form that you need to fill in once a year, when you get a month before that date, it just forms that that thing just comes to the forefront, you know, it just And that's in the future.  I don't think that's very difficult to make, but it would also create this expectation on the parts of users that I always know what I need to be doing because it's also the first thing on the list.  For now I wouldn't do that, I would just do like a matrix of a lot of tasks and forms which is not pretty but just works.  I think we solve for working first and then for pretty and yeah that's that's how we do it. Of course the forms view, this thing must have everything, yes, like a subsection of the home page but yeah.  Okay so we have, just trying to figure out where I am right now in terms of sorry, admin, the employee EMP portal, we have  data, office, forms, right? And data happens in admin, office happens in admin, admin and forms happens in employee portal.  Yeah. This thing, right? What is the last data, office, forms?

1:48:20 - A L
  Forms, yeah, yeah.

1:48:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, like, what is office stuff? Is that office carbon footprint?

1:48:27 - A L
  Yeah, but it could also go in employee forms, right? Because if I, if you are the office manager for the portfolio office, I'm going to send it to you and then it should show up in your employee portal.  Got it, got it.

1:48:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. So let's change this and main, main, add, look, task, add, look, task. Does it make sense? Because it is managed here on  pain. Yeah. But it's finished on the add-of task.

1:49:04 - A L
  Yeah.

1:49:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Okay. It's fine because this is really, we need to make notes on this.

1:49:20 - A L
  Yeah, I realize what, maybe, no, we can do that later. But we haven't actually been done the calculation part on the carbon part.  But I do realize, maybe we don't need it, because that's, once we get the data, then we have to put it into a certain format.

1:49:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I would assume that once we have the data formatted, it is not the hardest thing.

1:49:46 - A L
  Assumption. Actually, let me share my screen to see, because we did that, so we did the form that Romeo did very, very quickly, and I did it before we even, tested it out or anything.  But Here, let me show you how the carbon reporting actually works, because then we might need to rethink this process.  Okay, do you see my screen?

1:50:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Let me put this in a new window.

1:50:26 - A L
  So we have this calculator, and this is the calculator that we base off of the thing, like depending if it's petrol, cool, whatever.  And then it has a unit thing, and then you create the calculation from it, right? And then the same thing with, like, so this is why we ask, like, what kind of fuel do you use, you know, what kind of, what kind of electricity?  And then what kind of country do you use, right? And then you use this and then you calculate it.  And then each one has like a calculation, and then based on certain countries, right? And that's how we calculate it for you.  then, you know, and then calculation, documentation, you know, sources. We have, you know, all the questions on how it, you know, it's assigned by the protocol aligned to GHG.  And so we're like, yeah, we have kind of the calculation process. This is actually good to talk to the UK companies.  They really care about this. then like, and then scope three, like code. Like, so this is like all the background information on how to do this chart, right?  And so the thing that you saw from Romeo is more of like NNIs, I guess, in terms of what information you need to be able to fill this in so that we can give you a scope thing in, right?  But like there is like, know, calculation that's all really, that so I guess my long-winded question is like you know you saw that what was created for we saw what was created for uh that Romeo made it's it's not really this but maybe like when they you know like do we need to have it more like you know the prettier version of this you know if I take a screenshot I put a prettier version of this or do you think our form is good enough to be able to get it to a point where it would be easily put into this this this portion do you know what I mean I don't know I could maybe no I think I think so I think so so currently people are used to this sort of thing they look at this it's dense but they understand they know what to expect when they see something from this like this right yeah and one of our points of differentiation is we collect information in a better way right so

1:53:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I guess yeah and if we ask so there's a separation there's two different things one thing is information collection and the other is uh business logic right so the business logic is uh can be anything really so as long as we ask the right the right questions we can format the information on anyway we want right yeah so if uh the forms romeo made collect these these data points we can output them in a way that represents this information so this table is just a way of representing this information yeah so yeah so I think I didn't go through it one by one to the question that's being asked is but I think that our the genius of fortify is knowing exactly the balance between I asked  boring or dry things in a way that's not boring or dry, but I can still use business logic in the backhand, transform them into the boring stuff because that's what the auditors want to see.

1:54:12 - A L
  I don't think that's very complex.

1:54:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because if you have the data in the database, the database is like a table basically, right? the database, you can have a translation layer, software that says, oh, this number refers to megawatts hour, but we don't want to talk in megawatt hour, we want to talk in another unit, we just convert the unit and store it in that way.  So as long as we collect information, we can do anything with it afterwards.

1:54:46 - A L
  Okay, yeah, and then that's fine. Just so you know the process on that. And we're gonna have to see when we have this made, and we're gonna test it with our pilots and then like see if we can get the information, and it might be like, okay, we didn't get the right information to be able to do it.  So it's Yeah, and that's likely because that's that's a lot of information It would be unheard of of doing this the first go and here yeah 100% so Just yeah Okay, we have three more minutes, but I think that we got really far today Let me just check my calendar because I think I have another meeting after this.  Oh, no, it got canceled I think so I do have another hour before but I don't know if you have another meeting But how do you think?  We should Tackle kind of like that not now or maybe it's time You know like now that we discussed this to bring an Ivan and Romeo or like the other people or do we need like a little bit More or what do you what do you think from from this?

1:55:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think now I need to Translate this and it's something I will do today. It's not a multiple-day thing I'll just translate this into very specific tasks and Maybe some drafts like I can show this to Romeo and  we will get it and we'll make a video together and you will understand it. And then there's some aspects of it that I think are more related to Ivan.  Like firing off an email is a backend email server kind of thing. So it's very easy for us to say, oh, just click here and send an email.  And maybe Ivan will say, oh, for that we'll need these things. I wouldn't know. So to be more specific, I'll just transform all of our decisions here into a list of tasks.  I'll put them on JIRA and I'll send you the link so you can check. Oh, yes, these are the tasks we've agreed upon.  And so we have visibility of what needs to be done.

1:56:40 - A L
  Okay, great. I just realized Ivan is going to be gone one day through Friday, like tomorrow through Friday. I don't think, like, I guess there's some stuff that we can do without him, I guess, like kind of like, like, I'm just thinking like the carbon reporting for offices because like we already have, you know, the forms done.  by Romeo right like and then now we need to have the front part of it done right like so there are things that I would say that Romeo can do while Yvonne is gone to move us forward to be able to have that discussion later on right or what is your It feels that way.

1:57:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes Yeah, I think I think so Yeah, so then no that's good.

1:57:25 - A L
  Okay, so should I then I should I leave you for the next hour? Then you couldn't have used that time to or like whenever the rest of time I also have another hour if you feel like we want to deep dive into some of these more or like also do this for the g-side Which I think is also missing like so it's also I think we need to do that at some point but tonight right now a ram memory is Crying I need I need some time to process this But yeah, we these sessions to me they're really helpful to understand how everything connects Yeah, and then I guess there's one more box you need to create is like task management box.  Yeah, I like so that's um a whole other thing too.

1:58:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Was it clear when just I don't know if you saw it on the You saw it you sent a heart emoji that thing I said on the JIRA about the epics um Is it clear to you what what why you do it together into something right?

1:58:22 - A L
  Yes, what is epics?

1:58:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm sorry.

1:58:24 - A L
  Is that that's this uh?

1:58:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, you know this is why I asked so epics are Groups of tasks. Yeah that usually deliver a function basically let's just call them initiatives right initiative is made of different movements Yeah, yeah, yeah, so basically that's the name that you're asked for this Yeah, and I figured that if we order things around that it's easier for us to look at this.  Oh, this is related to the next I agree.

1:58:48 - A L
  I think that's better rather than like like a hundred different tasks that you can't see the overall Um part of it.  So I think that's I agree. Yeah. No, thanks for spending some time organizing that so So yeah, no, so I think this is good, but based on like looking at E, it's not as complicated as G, it seems like, but I feel like there are some things missing in G, but I think we do have some, we still at least have some progress because he's done the carbon reporting and then the employee feedback or more like forms.  And I think I need to get one more form to you about that. And then the cloud carbon reporting is totally new, but it's really based off of those directions.  So we need to figure that out there. Yeah. Yeah.

1:59:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that the more we figure out these primitives, I really like the analogy of primitives. So as soon as we fix task management, we fix that task management for all of them.  And it will happen for sure that we have solved task management in the context of, let's say, environmental. And then we start applying it to, I don't social and we realize

2:00:00 - A L
  there's something different.

2:00:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At that point, I think it will be very tempting to say, oh, we'll just make this exception to our task.  And I think we should avoid it as much as we can. Sometimes we can't avoid it, because otherwise, we introduce a lot of entropy in the software.  it's difficult to remember these specific rules and things start to break. And we don't know where they are breaking.

2:00:22 - A L
  But yeah, I think we're better.

2:00:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect.

2:00:26 - A L
  OK, I will leave you to work on this. But thanks for your help. I'll see you at the Hydro meeting.  Got it. See you later.

2:00:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. No. We'll see you later at Hydro.
