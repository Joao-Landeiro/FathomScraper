  Are we waiting for the mail or are we are we waiting Yeah Can you hear me now?

1:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you hear me now? One two one two. Yes, it's over now.

1:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah. Oh, yeah, so are you waiting for a mail?

1:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh See you said it would come. Um, it's actually it's a weird today is kind of a half-day holiday here in brazil So, Maybe okay, let's do this you and I we can use this time Um, how did you go for the past few days?  It was fine.

1:43 - Ivan Ćelić
  I guess we didn't do much on the design side at least from my perspective we Did develop inside we had to complete these controls and stuff.  So that that was it basically Got it and You

2:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what I'm thinking is, what I'm thinking right now is, sorry. So what I'm thinking right now is, do you think I'm being too square on these discussions that we have with Abby?  You can be honest.

2:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  What do you mean by square? I don't know.

2:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sometimes I feel that I'm really trying to force a certain formal structure to things. At times I'm like, yeah, this is help, because then we just backtrack things and say, yes, you're okay.  No, no, no.

2:49 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's, that's good to be to try to force some formal things and try to explore all the options. I think those meetings are fine for that.  It's just something that we have to make a decision like we did today and just move with it. I think it's fine there.  So I don't think that's a problem, to be honest. I mean, I'm just not sure if, how will Romeo understand everything that needs to be done.  So I think it's important that you also understand it, of course, by heart. And then that way we are all on the same page.  And that's it basically. That's all I think is important here. Yeah. I mean, it's not easy, it's not an easy process because you can see that it's also the whole process that Ab is trying to translate to this is not really straightforward and you can look at it multiple views and it has multiple stuff and it's here and it's also there and it's all over the place.  But maybe we should just try to make it as simple as possible right now and try to do something later.  But I think we are on a good path there for now. OK.

3:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah. I don't want to hold you too much then, because I don't think they're coming, so yeah, see you later, see you tomorrow, I guess.

4:08 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, okay, let me know if you have any questions, but yeah, I think I find with priorities that we mentioned today.  they make sense to me.

4:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm wondering if they have clarity on the data points. Yeah, I think I abstract discussion.

4:24 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I think they just need to say, okay, we need three graphs, like one is like normal art and the other one is round chart, pie chart or whatever, and then we just put them on the screen.  We have already designed for charts, at least some design, so we can just, as far as I'm concerned, we can just put those boxes in the page and say that's it for now, and I think we'll go with something like that for now.  yeah, let's see what they come up with, and then we can discuss how to present it in the easiest way for both design and development for now.  For sure, for sure.

4:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, thank you. Thank you.

4:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  See you.
