0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So basically, I thought about just launching a season to start with. the name of the podcast is Exotic Matter, I like that.  There's two things. There's an aesthetic vibe to it. I like the 1950s research lab vibe. by like zone, there I mean sounds, you know, this kind of thing.

0:31 - Florian Heinrichs (clientfriendly)
  Okay, I like that. Well, I like it. The fact that it's not some SEO optimized, like the workshop success podcast or whatever, because that's I'm very good at non optimizing for SEO.

0:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm very good at that.

0:47 - Florian Heinrichs (clientfriendly)
  Same here. to be honest, also, I hate it. I do it professionally, even I'm going to have to deal with marketing matters.  But this entire idea that all every human endeavor has to be

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you're subjected to optimization efforts so that an algorithm is happy that that doesn't make sense to me anyways yeah So we are we are lying on that and the idea is What's the thesis behind the whole thing is I've been talking to people that I've talked to before that have expressed this view that That's The way to stand out in consulting work sometimes agency work is knowledge expertise based stuff Is um is a lot around how you package it right so sometimes The questions go a little bit more Really about workshops, but in your case, I think the direction I would like to explore is much more the the signature methodology The positioning and there was also an aspect that I found interesting from your conversation with matt oddkinson  Yeah, we've mentioned the the marketing people wanting to Be more integrated with the business or the operation side.

2:11 - Florian Heinrichs (clientfriendly)
  Maybe I'm misquoting, but that got my eye Let me see how they I think that Well the the good markers want to be more part of the upstream decision making which has to take place in order for marketing to be Effective and efficient and many firms certainly most of the firms I engage the it's the The situation is the business doesn't want to do the go-to-market stuff, so they hire a marketing team But then they don't want the marketing team to mess with the business strategy or to speak to clients and services so the marketing team sit in their little silo and Everybody hates them for not doing much But obviously they can't do much because they're given the inputs  They require and to your points, I see different flavors of this. I don't see many marketers that understand it that understand the problem.  There's certain inputs that need to be given. So they can do that job. I would consider those the good ones and at the risk of sounding very arrogant and  off many people that aren't too many.  Or not good yet, which that is just but that's not on the people who fill these jobs. It's a function of how the firms hire.  They don't take moxing seriously. They just want to delegate this stuff. So they effectively go out and hire someone very junior who is sort of an assistant, almost like an assistant.  And they get an assistant salary and death there as well because proper senior moxing would be expensive. hire someone cheap to just do the LinkedIn or whatever.  to run the tactics. But at the same time, somehow have the expectation that they hit very strategic objectives, help us try to stop land revenue without proper construction without being given unnecessary inputs or the strategic decisions that need to be made for them to be able to do the work that they aren't there.  And then that what that means is the people who get those jobs end up in a situation where they have all of the responsibility, but none of the decision making power.  And that's a recipe for getting burnt out. sure. sure.

4:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think there's a, I think that's a pattern for other jobs as well. And I think that's an interesting signal that we could explore.  Before we get to animate it, I will do this on Riverside. So I'll send you the link here on the chat.  Yeah, perfect. The app we wanted to love.

5:00 - Florian Heinrichs (clientfriendly)
  Well, I haven't used much of it. still like it at this point. I like it a lot, but the problem is you run a show where you regularly have guests on who join you from an enterprise IT context.  Very often they will not be allowed to use the Chrome browser and then you run into issues with the app because it's just like when we back when we tried it, it wouldn't work in any other browser and it pretended to work in Chromium browser.  So Edge in theory should have functioned, but we lost I think three or four recordings because it did not work despite not giving a warning or anything.  And we wasted everybody's time. yeah, I don't know. let's hope it isn't.

5:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I mean, I'm on the Chrome. I'm on Chrome here as well.

5:43 - Florian Heinrichs (clientfriendly)
  So we should be fine. It's just my pro tip. And maybe they have updated it since I don't know.  It's been two years or so since we tried it. Got it. So moving over.

5:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'll exit this conversation.
