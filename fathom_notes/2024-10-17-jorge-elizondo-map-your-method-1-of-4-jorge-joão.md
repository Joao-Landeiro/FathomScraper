2:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I just had some cookies a second ago as well. I had cookies because they were ready, but I was very on the fence about either cookies or popcorn.  Then I thought I had the cookies already because sometimes I eat popcorns with chopsticks, so I don't get my hands dirty and I can work on the computer.  I understand the fascination with popcorn. I really like popcorn as well.

3:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, wow, it's been a long ride and I noticed that you are night all right you like to work at night.

3:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I am I am a few hours ahead of you so maybe that's even that also makes that but I usually stop working at I don't know eight in the night sometimes nine does that count as a night owl.

3:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe you can stop working at eight but you usually but night like later like 12 1am.

3:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Usually no usually no usually I go to bed at 11 like half past 10 11.

3:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And do you have a full time job or do you just do consulting.

3:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is my thing yeah. And yeah, like I've, I've, I've been spending so much time in the mirror for different projects.  It's like my second home now. So yeah, this is what I do.

4:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you also decide that each frame and everything like the visual design? I do everything myself.

4:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have done things that are a little bit more illustrated. But usually, I only do that when I've done the exact same format 15 times.  Because if I change something in the format, then it becomes harder to iterate. So I just prefer to use as much as I can inside the mirror stuff.  But some people are really, they're like artists. They're like illustrators on a mirror. I don't know if you know this woman, Lucy Agolini.  She makes like these landscapes. It looks like a city. It's really nice. It's like next level, really.

4:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Where can I find her? Let me see.

5:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you sent me the...

5:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah. Because I've been looking also for someone that, you know, I'm barely adopting Miro but I want to use it as my tool to integrate with Locibin because it's good for my mapping and things like that and I'm already implementing it for some other things I couldn't tell you later but I would love someone that can help me with the design aspect, you know?  Like, maybe put illustration like, you know, when you go into Miro, they send you a presentation like, welcome to Miro or explore Miro and you have these illustrations of people with a jetpack and things like that, you know?  So, that will make you know, like just working with Miro with clients is really good, like it's interactive it's collaborative, it's amazing but adding that design aspect it adds something beautiful.

5:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree. It's also very brandable. Did you open this link?

6:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  it's kind of mind-blowing. Oh, wow. So how did you contact her? I found her on LinkedIn.

6:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I remember, honestly, mean, true story. When I saw her LinkedIn profile, I actually said, I'll upload to myself.  Holy . Because I was like, this is really good. And I sent her a message and saying that. she was like, oh, thank you.  She seems to be very easygoing and approachable. But we are not friends or anything. I just found her on the internet.  I never spoke to her. I like her approach.

6:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Detangling, complex requirements. I like a visual solution. Sometimes I find it too cheesy what people put in their description.  But I think it's a good one. maybe it's too much. I mean, visually. I think she's like. like the Ferrari of the Miro boards but how much do you think she's charged for just designing some honestly I don't know because she's based in Netherlands so she's probably charging European prices but I don't know I never asked oh wow she developed like a Miro bird inside right like yeah she developed the she actually developed for Miro the yes oh well yeah but I mean it's because it's a nice little skill set you know just working with Miro and it's a lot you know like maybe people don't find it right now like a something big but you know like this is the first person that I in thanks to you that I know she actually solves this problem you know making elegant mirrors not everyone wants an elegant  mirror or maybe it's not about that so she's maybe she's cashing and so good cash you know I hope so everybody says good I mean everybody I don't know but this is the kind of person that I bumped into on LinkedIn right but we're not close but other people that I know and that they talk about her they always say nice things about her so I hope she's just cashing it um but yeah this is really good and also um I think there's like things relatively easy to do that you can do to brand and and decorate sort of say your your mirror boards it's not really the the thing I do but we can just I can just send you the tips that I find it's it's included no problem with that because maybe maybe that's useful to you thank you so when you're when you're ready let's get  Am I going to be able to collaborate with you on the mirror? Yes, yes.

9:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  By the way, let me send the link again, the mirror link. Just before it got in, so you didn't get it on the chat.

9:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In the email? No, it's here on the chat. Oh, but I didn't log in at 4pm o'clock, so that's why I did it.  Yeah, no problem. And do you prefer a mirror or a mirror? Because I found the mirror interesting more for the...  I know it's the same, because right now I'm seeing that you're hitting some sections. You know, like I thought it was not possible or a mirror, but I was...  That's why I... Right now I'm doing like a... I think it's... called training in English for psychedelic coaches and I'm using mural you know to go step by step and on hit or unlock each step as we go through the process but I didn't know it was possible in mural so that's nice yeah I think I have much more like a thousand times more experience with Miro than mural at some point Miro had like a very nice deal that you could get it for free but I didn't get it and then I just got used to Miro and I think you could do like it is so powerful I think you could do really really complex things inside of Miro like you could embed web pages instead of Miro which is crazy but they don't they don't work in the same way they're a little bit they take a while to refresh but anyway I'm sorry I get excited about this stuff so shall we  shall we begin let's do it let's go the way and let's raise some likes and just have fun nice nice okay so you you're in right i see you here so i'll pull you i'll pull you to me yeah i'm not seeing you you know because if i'm in mirror or i'm going to see you do you want me to stay at at at the meet and see at the at the website or you let me know when i can go to the mirror because if i go to the mirror i don't see you you know okay okay now i think um i think it's best to stay in the mirror and i'll just try to convey my emotions with my voice and do you know something you know like i have the big space but um in Europe you can summon the attention into like a center point do you can can you do that in in mirror no like bring people to me yes yes yes  Do you see my cursor here? I click here and bring everyone to me.

12:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, amazing.

12:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Is it because I just paid Mira just because I couldn't do that in Mira, but thank you. OK, now I know.  No problem.

12:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And anyway, so let's go. So basically, we are here. This is like the first meeting of four meetings. You've already have the structure.  It's perspective and process.

12:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  have a collect phase and then we have a craft phase.

12:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So today is about perspective and about collecting. And it's not incredibly complex. kind of exercise we will do is just a bunch of a bunch of provocative questions, which some of them might even be familiar to you.  I don't think they are very common, but you have experience in this. So maybe maybe they are. And before we move into that, I'd like to.  Just share with you really quickly what I got from, know, looking into your materials.

13:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you for sending that stuff was really interesting.

13:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I assume that T I F is therapy integration framework, something like that. Mm hmm. Yes. Okay.

13:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool. I was I was intrigued by that and then This is just like one of the things I already had in mind, but maybe we can develop some more here in this working, but yes.  Cool.

13:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So from from your from your notes, what I could extract and on a general level is okay. So you have this the four steps of psychedelic integration and also the general integration process, which is kind of an extra step.  I think there's a lot of interesting things, especially on the next extra step. I think there's Something I cannot really put my finger on, but my captures my attention in there.  When I look at the way you work or the way

14:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You talk about your work, there's like the individual and the group aspect. You talk a lot about outcomes and you have this rigorous way of talking about your work, talk about outcomes, talk about frameworks, talk about sequences.

14:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The way you explain things is very well divided and structured.

14:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's kind of a style aspect of the way you work. You have those things about mixing innovation tools for personal development.  Visual thinking appears everywhere.

14:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that's why you like Miro, that's why you've mentioned these things.

14:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And also, I sense that you have these jobs to be done approach to things. Did I get it correctly?  Yes. Okay, cool, cool.

14:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you mean approach?

14:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you mean that my approach took my kind of work, right?

14:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, my way of working.

15:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, your way of working.

15:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe I could call it made a little bit like style, you know It's like there's a certain Jorge flavor to how you talk and how you talk about your work and it's it's from our interaction this consistent and Related to that the kind of language you use you know Transformation focus action oriented you mentioned the The the rule as a guide which might seem obvious, but there could be other ways of you know Position yourself and this is the way you do it You also have this thing of listing Specific tools and processes which I think Communicates expertise when you talk about specific things, but at the same time you don't use a lot of jargon, which I think is a good thing and It seems it seems something you do on purpose.

15:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It seems careful the way you don't use jargon

16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  because on the podcast at some point you've used a little bit more jargon because it was a different kind of conversation.  But on your website it wasn't so much jargon. And you have a structure of the writing style. Do you want?  Okay. Go ahead.

16:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Sorry, sorry.

16:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I didn't want to interrupt.

16:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm just getting my notes from my head out that I actually think that it's the name of the consulting company that I want to do.  It's called, in a way, the identity type, but it's also transformation, innovation and future. So that's why I talk about outcome based because it's not about just having an intention, but it's about having a vision.  the intention is just one step that you want to put your energy first to attain the vision, so that's why first we have to transform and then we have to innovate so we can get close to the future.  In a way, so that's kind of my language approach to things through the psychedelic integration Quick question.

17:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Did you come up with a name before the concept?

17:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In what like what concept?

17:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll give a personal example and then you tell me if this makes it to you Sometimes a name comes to me and I'm like this is a great name and then then I think about the product that the name fits But the name comes first.

17:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Was was this something like that for you? You know, I've been doing this for a long time and I always do by Jorge Lisondo or Jorge de , but because I want to spell it I was looking at the name and The first name it was not actually like teeth.  It was just I was looking at Something that it's related to identity, but also I don't them I show Result or the process  in the name but I find it interesting you know to I'm looking at all these branding companies because I have a lot of influence through branding and no one uses the identity factory you know so I look it up and I like it the identity factory because at the end here it's a place or space it's a platform it's a workspace whatever name you want to put it but it's kind of innovation workspace for your new identity but I think it's more than I had identity so I put the thief thing and Chagipiti before also like getting into my thing about creating the consulting and I really resonate just with thief and then Chagipiti gave me thief means transformation innovation okay so it was okay that aligns to what I want to do and sometimes I don't know if it fits what people actually want but I was doing my research and what really people want is transformation maybe they don't the result  transformation and in a way having a new identity is innovation. future means working towards the future that this is where coaching comes in and the role as a guide comes in you know because they want to be close to the future they want to work with the future they want to negotiate with the future not the past.  So that's why I'm getting out of the therapy and coming more into the coaching thing. So I think the name it's been developing in a way but the tips the are being consistent.

19:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it now it's it's interesting how names can have so many layers and they just work right? do that.  if I sometimes extend myself. No it's good it's good. We're also learning how to work together so this is part of the part of the process.  So this slide is not really an activity right it's just a way of creating clear definitions. So we start with mental models which

20:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  are like maps of slices of reality, like you have a mental model about what is a country, we have a mental model about what is good coaching, you have a mental model around anything, right?

20:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And for some of these, not all of them, inside of the mental model, you have an approach to doing things based on that model, right?  So and that approach is more practical and we call it a framework.

20:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And we divide that framework in two aspects.

20:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  One aspect is the more practical one, which is like the steps or the tasks, the things you need to do.  And the other one is more the tools that you use to operate that framework.

20:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So for instance, let's say you come up or we come up with the framework for figuring out if you need the fifth step of your process, right?  and this framework is based on the mental model that we have from the needs of your clients.

21:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then we realized that to operate on that mental model of that client there's a few questions we need to make and we realize it's like four questions for those are the steps and then we have the tools to remind us of what are the four questions which could be like the diamond that spoke on the last conversation.  So mental models are the broader thing and you have several mental models, have mental models for a lot of different things and then inside of mental models frameworks and frameworks are composed of steps and tools.  And this is relevant and now I will use a lot of the timer okay from here because these questions are very easy to go deep on them and I'd like to keep a certain pace because you are curious and I am curious.

22:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, if we don't put the watch, you know, the clock rolling, ruling us, we'll just have a fantastic conversation, but maybe not get there.  Let me just give you a little bit of an overview.

22:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, these are questions about beliefs and narratives, values and behaviors, perceptions and trends, which is more like future oriented and experiences and education, okay?  And for these first ones, I'll ask more about the business side of things, because that's our priority.

22:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I want to get that out of the way.

22:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then we have another session of this, but around the more personal aspects of things, okay, like how you view the world from the perspective of Jorge and not the business.

22:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so let's make a quick run.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can I bring it to you? Can you can I bring it to you to me? Yeah, okay. Let's see.

23:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes.

23:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, so you have a history with your business, right? So there's steps that you've tried in your process and some you can some you have kept some you have brought back.

23:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you think of a step in your business method that was important that seemed to be important at the time but at end it wasn't important one step in your business seemed important back then in the past but now that you look at it you're like oh I didn't have to spend so much energy on this because this was not relevant well  It's if I think of the things that I do, it's maybe content creation, developing framework, developing my ideas, but I think all of those are in a way important.  But maybe right now, maybe I don't do it, I delegate it, but I think it's important, it's the content creation because that's how people have awareness of me, so that's an interest.  don't have like a clear, can you give me an example?

24:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can give an example or we can just do have so many questions we can explore from another angle, but like for me, from my side, right?  At some point, was spending a lot of, this is a silly example, I was spending a lot of time in designing the best document.

25:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  like invoice I want to make a really beautiful invoice and then at the end of like it's not that nobody will see this but only a few people will see this and the people that see this are already my clients so it's nice to have a good invoice but there's other things that I need to focus my attention on so I realized that I shouldn't spend so much time on those documents and spend more time on the most visible stuff for me is my personal example okay right now as a business kind of mindset what step in my business seem important developing more in my psychedelic knowledge you know right now it doesn't seem important because I have it and I also know that I don't need to be an expert in it I can hire a psychedelic coach or I can pay for someone that knows I can pay for an expert I don't like I now I'm an expert but I need to be more on the business side right so right now  seem important right now it's not important I think that's that's one of the things okay also as another step in business maybe right now I don't find it that important to really become an expert in marketing but at the end I have to be but it's not as important as it used to be at the beginning I needed to learn marketing because I I didn't know anything about it but right now it's not important because I know and now more than before and I can delegate it I don't know if that works well you know enough and you know don't need to be you are at this level of of competence that for now it's okay maybe later you explore deeper the the marketing aspect but for now you're  related to your business do you have like a desire that most of your clients mentioned a desire of them what's the one desire that 80% of your clients mentioned that they want okay so I'm going to my notes because I already did that homework like I know the sire could be like a one right yes but it's not actually a need or is kind of it because I have a like also like what's the difference between a need and a desire because sometimes isn't the need the desire I understand your point I think for the purposes of this question you can use whatever makes the most sense to you I think both need or just people the 80% of people desire freedom you know freedom from mind freedom from  suffering from just freedom also they want freedom from or we could say when you're free you have clarity so they decide like their sides clarity wellness at the end like well-being and wellness being okay maybe when they come they want like they want to have purpose or they want to lead a purposeful life they want to have a meaningful life so they want to develop more professionally but at the end they didn't know that what they want it's transformation freedom getting on stock getting on blog getting you know like feeling just also not know by someone else don't be acknowledged by someone else their success or what they do because I have two types of clients the one that already have the business or financial success but they're not happy  And I have other clients that they just want to heal, but I want to mainly focus on the people that already are, you know, high performance or are in a way they have success, but they don't feel it inside.  So there's, there's like emptiness, you know, inside of the, they want wellness, they want freedom, they want transformation. They want peace, charity and purpose, just to name a few of those.

29:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Cool. Very good. So on to, on to the next one. This is more related to like things you do.  Is there something in your business that you do that almost no one else like from your competitors does?

29:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's a nice question. I think I have, I'm really authentic in what I do, you know, like I genuinely want to have a relationship with the person to help them develop more, know, most of the people I see that they do it for economic meaning, economic intentions, or like you go to a shop and they just give you the the medicine and you on your own.  So I have personalized attention, you know, like what people love about my job and I have here when I do the FPS or like question about like what are the top five things that you love about my coaching or my follow-up or everything, you know, and they say that it's very professional and very empathetic, know, my approach is pure empathy.  And they love that, you know, that it's professional and empathy because that's why they want to come to me because they want to have a safe environment, a support system, know, that those are key things I design a safe and support system for them to explore themselves, to go inwards, to go into the unconscious.  So that's why it's important for them to see me as professionally as possible that that's why a lot of people, they don't find that in the shaman or the clinical side, it's too medical.  So right now, what they love about me also it's my, what also my difference, but the rest is my identity, like how I promote myself, how I communicate the things that I do, how like innovative it's the way I do things, you know, so also another thing that they found when they come to my retreats right now, this is different from their retreats, right, but they found really like,  kind of, you know, like, it's, I don't know how do you, like, how do you say in English, but it's about that, like, kind of, well, like, good, you know, like, in a way, love, but I don't love the word love, you know, but they find, like, okay, they're thankful because they're like, kind of, how I handle things, always professionally, always close, but very respectful, so they find a lot of respect in my approach.  Could be kindness, could be the word?

32:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Kindness, yeah, okay.

32:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that my approach, you know, in a way, it's something that I know, like, it's hard to find.

32:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, especially when you have mentioned this balance of professional and the empathetic release took out to me. So, what part of your method has been around for the longest, because you've been doing this for a while, probably you've had like steps, is it similar to the first question?  So some steps you've always done, some steps you've stopped doing, what is one thing that you've never stopped doing since the beginning?

33:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Screaming, or you know, like the evaluation process, you know, it may be rigorous and exhausted, exhausted, like it's a lot of people say, oh why so many questions, but because of my experience, and because of my wisdom in this process, this is not for everyone, and my first thing that comes to mind is the safety, the wellness of the people, so I need to really know what they have done, like a thorough work, like inner work, or they  just are curious and they want to know because I also I think in the level that I want to play I don't want to be teaching Kyrton garden and more in the university level so I'm very rigorous meticulous in my process so also that's the it's it's been the latest like the longest the one that has been shifting and that's why the focus right now it's in the integration it's integration but the one that works it's the questioner the the process of evaluation and scripted as well of the psycho-education you know like the recommended books the recommended books documentaries TV shows and I also do like kind of modules of me pre pre documented videos of me talking about different aspects of psilocybin the science of psilocybin all of those things you know the psycho  And building the relationship, know, right now I don't do it, but it's not, it has not been, it's, it hasn't been changed, you know, because now the team that I have, they need to develop, they need to really interact with the people, you know, and when I think it's another aspect and, you know, yes, yes, that's, that's some things.  What's the part of your method that has been around the longest? Yes. Kind of this little framework of you could call it evaluation, preparation, exploration, integration and follow up.  But at the end, the integration and follow up, I haven't been able to really create the best that I can.  So that's why I'm looking for help. at the end, that's the big aspect, know, preparation, exploration or email. Urshan, integration and follow-up.  Yes.

36:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. You're very quick to answer this one. So I think it was really at the forefront of your mind.  Now, looking more like at the market, let's say, or at the world, do you have a known business place that you got the latest business inspiration from?

36:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Something for your business? Disney. The latest was going to Disney. Right now, I'm looking at branding agencies or looking at branding design and collections to just to get around about the innovation of branding, illustration and things all over the world.  It has not been related to psychedelics. Alex, but I use Instagram, I actually, you know, I think I have something clear in my mind.  When I look for something, it's just I want to find what I have in my mind so I can translate it.  But it's not like I want an inspiration from someone. Maybe there's some lifestyle people that inspire me. you don't know, I think I love my life.  know where I'm going. But my kind of job is trying to translate what I have in my inner, like inside life.  yes, I think Disney was a really good experience to get in touch with it while it's conceptualizing a project, like the thematic of a project, like how they do the customer journey in a way because you get into a roller coaster and during the journey, you know, and there's design inside of that, even though if you're just getting inside and the emotions  but it got me thinking a lot. So that's why I actually changed what I'm doing and I was looking for things and I found you, thanks to Disney, you know, so.  Right now, I'm in a place where I'm looking at design agencies also, you know, to develop more my brand.  I want to create now my brand. I've been, well, delegating some people to do my branding, I love actually branding.  The thing is that I don't know how to translate. I'm not a graphic designer, that's the thing. But I'm a visionary.  I know what I want and so it's been hard to find someone that could translate what I want or can extract the information that I have inside so they can develop something for me.  yes, I think, yeah.

38:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you have Pinterest? No. Pinterest is very good for this. I recommend you try Pinterest because it's like YouTube, it learns about you.  really well.

39:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And yeah, it's just a recommendation.

39:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you this recommendation later. There's a lot of good stuff in there.

39:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So let me move a little bit quicker here.

39:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you think is the biggest risk for your industry in the next five years?

39:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The biggest risk for my industry in the next five years, that's why I'm moving ahead of the pact because we don't know for certain if it's going to be legal.  So that's why I want to go. It's been also like a barrier, like a rock because the uncertainty, it's not going to be legal in in five years or 10 or 15 years.  don't know. We actually don't know and I don't want to play with uncertainty. So that's one. And number two, I think what I've been developing, it's methodology, not just taking a psychedelic.  That's one of the tools that I use, but it's actually my guidance, my approach of things, my way of working that people live.  So that's why I want to put more into it. want to develop more of my skills of facilitating because that's, that's the thing.  And so I want to get lost. Another risk of the industry is that they actually go after, after, after this, you know, like government police, like they don't want, like, it's impossible now, but it's a risk that I need to take in mind.  Also, like they want to show off, like shut down everything about psychedelics. So Another, what do you think is the biggest risk for my industry?  And just that, like also, like misuse, like people. start doing it for the bad things or it becomes way commercial that people think it's it's just about selling a candy and it's not actually candy that's why I want to develop a more day in my framework of thinking of teaching people and making them aware of the importance of the follow-up of the preparation, the guidance because it's not the psychedelic itself.  we have to move past that because the risk is that yes people kind of crazy people can do bad things we don't know so I don't want people to blame psychedelics for those kind of things because people don't know how to use them so it's also like unconsciousness, the risk you know, unconsciousness of things and another risk is that people only look at psychedelics through the clinical lens and it's not the only lens we still can grow from and use the new psychedelic as our group  both too, but it's not just from the like the clinical or the therapy side, it can be used for innovation, it can be used for other things.  Got it.

42:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It stays in a sensible balance, a sensitive balance, right? From all the, so you can read this faster than I can read it out loud, but just to give some context, sometimes we learn something, we go through a course in certification that is so good that it makes the previous ones feel like, oh, I was just wasting my time.  This one made the most sense to me. Have you had this experience?

42:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm not sure.

42:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's a valid answer.

43:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If everything you've studied, you know, connects in some way, this is more about the ones that were really good and not so much about the ones that were not so good.

43:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe my phrase is a little bit extreme.

43:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, there's always good, good courses and there's some bad courses, right? That's for sure. But we're in the experience and education, right?

43:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, correct.

43:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  From all professional Chinese you got, which made everything else seem basic. But I don't get the question.

43:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so imagine that you have done several courses, which I think you have done several courses. And one of them is really superior.  Like, it really teaches advanced stuff. And now that you know this advanced stuff, the other

44:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  stuff that you learned before it's like it's still valuable but oh my god there's so much more i didn't know there was so much more i thought i was learning advanced things but now that i see this course now i know what advanced is it's like it changed your expectations of okay right now i'm taking an innovation course about it called the next generation branding and at the end what i love it's the learning model you know that it's actually like what were we doing here you know like we're actually learning through mural so through a framework like the way you have it you know that made like i don't like the theory it's good but i i'm actually learning through this through through getting in touch with my ideas through like having feedback and interacting with others and seeing the responses you know it i'm learning more  more holistically and more integrally, know, like people share some stories or share some books or share some interesting ideas.  And I think what makes the difference is the learning model, you know, not actually the information right now. I don't care about the information.  It's about the learning model to adopt things more fast, more quickly, more efficient, more agile. So that's, I think, what makes everything else in the past like suck.  It's that it didn't have like a learning model that actually help people to learn. You could I could have I did the university high school in everything and other courses, but it's just information, you know, like, I didn't find it interesting and valuable because I learned that through a book.  So I came here just to tell me what's in the book and also just to have a certificate. I don't care about.  I want the practicality. I want the action oriented. I it's about that, you know, because. Because again, yes, I had the certificate, know, like I did the certificate in a role in a Colorado institution.  And I was super excited, but I didn't learn anything new that I haven't read in a book. maybe they also tell me, like, why are you here?  If you know all of this, you have read it, like, read all the books that we teach here. Because I thought that I was going to learn something new.

46:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is an institution, you know?

46:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And how is it possible that I already know everything without coming to that, you know, like, I'm not a genius.  I'm like, you know, like, maybe right now, I think I feel I want to be humble. in my mind, it's, know more, like, my thing that you are actually the people that are doing the clinical trials.  So teach me something different. Teach me something new. So I didn't find it so valuable, you know? So right now I'm doing the course.  love it. Got it.

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's very interesting, thing you said, because I think that thing you said about, you know, the information that it's on the book, because a lot of what we're doing here is also related to that for yourself as well, right?  I mean, people can get information. And you told me this, you said, people don't want just my information, they want my leadership, I think that was your sentence.

47:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, have something else, something else, something else, you know, it's also the skills and the tools, you know, like, if you, there's a phrase that I really love that, if you give a fish to a man, it will eat for one day, but if you teach him how to fish, he will eat the rest of his life.  So, it's about teaching them how to learn. It's not about teaching something. So, with CELOSive and innovation and with this framework, I want to teach people how to learn, you know?  Mm-hmm. So, I want to change how they learn. about things. that's why Miro and my mapping and psilocybin, it's going to change how they see the world and how they see learning.  So my framework, it's more not just about psychotherapy, it's not about healing. It's about changing the way we learn things.  And having these workshops with me and having these interactions, I'm going to train them. I'm going to train their neuroplasticity to really build the connections and the neural pathways with these kind of skills and tools to really get ahead in life.

48:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  there's a book I must recommend you. Just a second. Do you know this one?

48:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm actually in a, in a, in uh, in a private with him. you were in the school of the possible yes oh i was on the last session yeah last year yeah one year ago and it's a great group and i actually have it in my amazon list the game of storming also liminal thinking because i think about uh liminal spaces so when i thought about him and also about he has visual frameworks that's how i ended up with you as well you know so that he was the connection got it yeah a great guy uh and also because of him i'm learning more you know like when the first day of the school of possible he didn't say instruction or theory let's go jump into the neural board tune tune tune i'm gonna put it into groups of three and i'm like well what's happening this is a new way of learning and when i go back to when i studied oxford england what i love about those play like the place that when i went to study  It's the way of learning, you know, like in Mexico or the United States is they just give you handouts And just have to fill them out and you listen to the teacher.  Okay. Okay. Okay, but in England was There's an intentional behind intentionality behind everything. So they have this. Okay, let's talk about a version let's see what She thinks about it.  So there's a Russian guy talking about what he thinks are a version of then a Brazilian then a Mexican then a US then a Switzerland Germany.  So, you know Maybe now with me mirror mirror. I can bring back. I can go back to that body and new kind of way So now I'm creating that, you know, so it's always, you know, I'm also, you know Observing the most interesting moments of my learnings It's being through gatherings, but intentional gatherings when we all sure But there's something in there.  Okay. So that's why I also do group setting or group retreats because I love the sharing of ideas, the group gatherings, there's something powerful in that.  I'm getting excited because I'm uncovering something. Cool, I can see the excitement.

51:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just today I was on Dave Gray's website like a few hours ago and I was checking his recommended book list.  I go there every now and then and I bought a book that I think has been out of print but thank God that there's like some old books here in Brazil that you can buy in secondhand and I got it and I'm very excited.  think it should arrive maybe next week. Yeah, I really like Dave, he has a very kind and smart and sophisticated way of thinking.  It's a great guy.

51:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you have the list of his books so I can check them out?

51:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll send you. Yeah, I can send you.

51:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, so I can take them out. But I'm a book collector as well. But what Dave Gray has, he doesn't have a good marketing or branding.  Maybe he's old school.

52:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think a lot of the people from that generation, they got a bit famous on the internet maybe 15 years ago.  And then internet was easier. If you had like a blog, it was OK. But now the internet is very competitive.

52:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And they still have their mindset from that time when they started experimenting. And just to close, Dave Gray, what I didn't like about the School of Possible is just all people.  But I like it in a way because it's experienced people. it's just their tool for me.

52:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you got the question. What's something that you've never seen, but you really want to learn? And you can go crazy on this.

52:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  As an entrepreneur, ways occurs that you wish existed. that the one that I want to develop, that it's, you know, like, I am going to be able to put it in words, but it's Loci, but in a way, it's kind of a course of a new way of learning.  It's kind of combining innovation processes with psychology and also psychedelics, but it's not merely about the scientific aspect of psychedelics, but it's about how can I work better, know, and have fun while I work, you know, so the course also, as an entrepreneur, I can see.  Apologies. also like a course that it's about not the actual product management road mapping or product road mapping it's you know like road mapping your life but with visual technology or visual thinking you know like co-creating your visual road like road map to life you know like having maps to navigate the territory we call life the co-creating route and having psychological safety in that so it's kind of being able to be in a workspace but also like being able to play not just sitting down to listen to others or just expressing you know actually playing like learning while playing in a way so it's it's a course that it's it's it's about playing it's about having fun  But in this having fun, it's about learning and, you know, so I don't know if that's actually a course, but it's a way of relating as well.  it's a course of connection in a way, but also it's pure learning, but in a different way. We could just get together and also there's no curriculum.  I don't know about something between those words.

55:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I understand because when I joined the School of the Possible, that was the thing I thought it would be.  And so I don't think it was exactly that, but that was the intention. that's the image I paint in my mind when you say, like, there's no curriculum.  People learn from each other at the same time.

55:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You create a space for people to share the best thing they have, right?

56:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe some guys really good at something and you do it with them.

56:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's the is the temporary guy Anyway, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think I understand the vision that if you're It doesn't seem so It's also like a course of Of teaching you the tools and the skills that you need to keep developing yourself, you know, like It's not about going to therapy.  It's about giving you the tools and the skills To know how to develop yourself So what are the suite of tools that you need?  What are the suite of skills that you need to start? developing yourself We have to use them in a way not just getting the tool skill, but how to use them Like I have opportunity to practice the application Yeah, right now hammer this thing five  Okay, now I know how a hammer works.

57:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Now let's hammer together, right?

57:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. I think I can do different things with this hammer. Like I can put a nail, but also maybe I can screw something, or maybe it helps me when a bad guy comes.  have like a hammer. So they actually, okay, they, I'm teaching them like why I use it, how I use it, and how they can use it and why it wouldn't be nice for them to use it.  know, like there's a purpose in why am I teaching this, you know, there's an intention of it.

57:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have another book for you. Maybe you know this because you have so many references.

57:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If you are familiar with Edward the Bono. Yes, lateral thinking.

57:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. So yeah. See, I assume that you knew when you knew. yes, yes, I did do it my research.

58:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I didn't really like to read and know about this, you know, so yes, there's actually a lot of bonus says about this divergent thinking about a lot and also there's a really good book that I love that it's called the creative trans.  How can we use utter state of consciousness to develop moral creativity and you know we're used to not developing this creative side.  So in a way when I did an analysis I knew that people had a problem not with ADHD and all of those things but they have lots of energy like creative energy that they don't know how to develop and they don't have the inner structure to develop because the word just tells them or teach them how to use the logical side of the brain not the creative side.  So the creative side can be so helpful but at the it's the one that creates or suffering because creates thoughts, negative thoughts,  one and again and again and again because we don't know how to train that that horse you know so the horse goes everywhere we need to train the horse so that's why I want to teach them the skills and another phrase that I love about Osho is that he he says that the greatest technology it's inside our two ears that it's all our brain it's it's it's a brain but people don't know where is the mouse and the keyboard so that's why I want to teach the skills and tools because if you have skills and tools to know how to use this to your to your favor that's how you can develop faster for sure there's a lot of these conversations so now this is the second half and these are not the same questions okay okay these questions are a little bit different but they're more about yourself I wanted to get the other one first because  in case we went over time and you couldn't stay.

1:00:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can stay a bit more, but in case you couldn't just we get that part out. And now we're moving to your...

1:00:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If you can also, we can do faster because I really want to like get as much as we can.  Okay, okay, okay.

1:00:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'll use the timer just to remind us. I keep forgetting to use the timer, but... Just do it, just do it.

1:00:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so next what part of your personal history doesn't make sense? Okay, an example like what happened to me or like something that I cannot accept?  Or what do you mean what part of my personal don't mean?

1:00:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's kind of... It's not so much that you don't accept, it feels very out of a typical path, you know.  I can give you an example if you want to. So I've been living in Brazil for 12 years, and this was kind of an accident because I sent an email to a guy and asked him about jobs.  And then I've met my wife in a hostel, I'll never see her again because we didn't live in the same city and I've been here so it's like it makes sense but it's different from I think it's what makes my life mine.  It's just very personal different from like, oh, I met somebody in the university, then we got married, then we got a house and a credit.

1:01:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, maybe what doesn't make sense to me is that I think I come from somewhere else, but that works.  I don't know. That's a really interesting question. I don't okay we can skip this one no problem because right now everything for me you know I don't know if you have done psilocybin I have not psilocybin makes you make sense of everything so right now I'm like everything makes sense to me you know like every single thing that has happened and every single thing that I know there's some difficult things there's some  things there's awful things for I learned to love every each part of my history and all of it all of it makes sense to me it makes sense to be here at this moment okay yeah that's very interesting I was talking to somebody I know very close that yes then psilocybin and I see it like in a responsible way and not just like for party and he said the same thing and I was like now that you said this and I was like yes of course the man has made sense of his life these  This question doesn't make sense for, the question doesn't make sense. Yeah, the question is, just put that the question doesn't make sense.  Yeah. Next.

1:03:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what's a belief that you've changed your mind, but it was really strong, like?

1:03:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I hate business, I think that was a belief. I had since I grew up that I hated negotiating, selling, know, I, I, I hate selling.  I didn't want to do it never, but when I changed it, it changed everything, you know, like business is empowering, you know, in a way, I know there's some unconscious and unethical businesses and bad people, but a business, it doesn't mean that a business, it's the same as money, money is not bad.  People have different values. but money is neutral. So that's why we see people with lots of money, but really bad people.  And we live in this kind of world that everything seems so  up, but we could end it. We could end suffering if all billionaire people really want that.  in a way, I'm also like, don't think there's bad in some things, you know, it's people just decide to do bad things because they don't know.  So another belief I held strongly that you have changed your mind about that identity or personality, it's not fixed.  know, a lot of people in my family made me think that this is the life that you got and that's it.  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot, I don't want to believe this. I cannot believe this.  I needed to change my mind of accepting life as it is that I actually can't change it you know that it's not fixed like nothing is fixed you know so from something that is like fixed mindset and growth mindset you know when you change your mind you can change so what's up believe you have strongly another belief I don't think like I'm not actually a people that have rigid beliefs I think my beliefs are flexible so I change belief sometimes but it's not it's not been hard to change you know it's just you know there's this mentality that it's called how to transformational mentality or mindset that it comes from this guy Robert Keegan that it's a Harvard professor he developed the adult learning or the learning process of an adult and he talks about just 1% of people have this kind of mindset would

1:06:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  you could shift identities you could shift mindsets because you know you're not the mindset you're not the belief you just use it as some as a tool to get what you want so is that the key in stages yes oh you know you know i was really it's so funny because i i saw it a few years ago and maybe i have the wrong idea and maybe i didn't get the right hand but i remember thinking oh i'm probably i feel so advanced and then it said thinking that you are advanced in this time that you're not advanced anyway so what's a personal value that you have that has cost you you don't you don't have a problem with that you're not sad that it has cost you but it has cost you do you have some personal value like that

1:07:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Trust me that it has affected me in a way, it's like I sacrifice things to have loyalty, you know, and be grateful, you know, like I'm grateful for the people that that I'm grateful to, know, like, I'm not the people that, you know, in the corporate world that when you have someone, there's some people that they don't care and they just put the feed inside in on top of you, you know, like, they don't have respect, they don't have loyalty, they don't have value, you know, there's there's no morality.  So I think I have loyalty and gratitude and another personal value that you pay the price for.

1:08:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if you can think, you don't have to share that with me, but if you can think of like, okay, being loyal is important to me, but because of that, I had to deal with some sort of negative consequence.

1:08:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Could it be I value myself or it's actually personal value, like name it, know, like, okay, maybe I value growth, so I have to leave some things behind because of growth, you know, even though, you know, I could stay with my family or I could grow, you know, and, you know, in a way, it's interesting because I'm loyal, I love them and I'm grateful for the opportunities.  But in my mind. I want to grow and if you don't go with me like I love you what I'm going to keep up going straight Mm-hmm You separate the loyalty and the attachment you can love without being Yes, yes, so growth growth.  It's growth. Yes. Oh This is repeated and I'm sorry about this Let's jump to the next one and then I'll Do you remember?

1:09:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't remember. It's okay. Let's go to the next one Apologies, um, so when you go somewhere new What's like the first thing you notice something you notice right away?  It could be very obvious or very subtle Okay They're charging can you can you tell me more about that the feeling?

1:10:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  the sensation, the bite. How do you feel those things?

1:10:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like, can you think of a specific moment like you visit a new place in your life? In my body.

1:10:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like I feel in my body and it's kind of... It makes me feel like I can connect with the energy.  It's either a person or a place, you know. That's the first thing and the other thing is just the aesthetics or the harmony and things, the beauty in it.  It doesn't have to be luxury, but it has to have balance. There's harmony, you know. I think it's called aesthetics, right?  the kind of... It frames nicely, you know. Like the way it wants to have a framework. The aesthetics, you know, like developing a nice framework.  In a way, uh...

1:11:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Aesthetics is a... It's an interesting field of philosophy, right? It mixes with a lot of different other topics.

1:11:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Also, I think, I don't know if Aesthetics goes with this sign of things. It does, I think, yeah. So it's also like this, and like...  I think about the design, I'd like to see the design of things.

1:11:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You know, the things you've mentioned, all of these things, the energy, the aesthetics, the beauty, all of them are related to sensing is like essential, not because of , but because of sensations.  Everything that is said is related to like your ability to receive sensations from the place, either visual sensations or

1:12:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  just to the vibe sensations that's it's very clear that all of these things they are related to a sensual approach to what you pay attention to right yes I like place the sensitivity there like there's like sensing the acting I like sensing it's not it's not about thinking it's about sensing the right okay do you have an opinion that most people disagree but you stay stick with it the change is possible and a lot of people don't want to change or just leave me like that I'm okay like that I don't need to change I'm looking at you and you're suffering with real cave okay okay and another  you know the most people disagree with me that uh like in order like for growth we need to go inwards you know and other people now i don't have time now why do i want to ask myself that what do i question myself now therapy doesn't work like lots of things you know to grow you need to go inwards and i also like psilocybin is a key aspect that i firmly believe in psilocybin i don't know if i wrote it right yeah of course i didn't ps i and why it's i yeah why yeah like that psilocybin and you  And also, you know, in my work, like, it's not about that, like, believe in psilocybin, right? But in a way, also, like, it's not about the psilocybin, it's about the methods, the framework.  I believe in the professional approach of things, and not everyone wants, also, like, in Latin America and Mexico, what they really want is just cheap stuff, you know, I can do it myself.  I can do it myself, you know, you don't believe in a coach, they don't believe in a professional service, they don't believe in leadership development, all of those things, and I really believe that investing in myself, it's the most important thing, you know, and that's what a lot of people that go through South  develop and we know, know, we think there's a lot, but there's more people that they don't, they don't want to invest in themselves.  They are not used to and they don't want to invest a penny.

1:15:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that's a, I think that's a common feeling. We also feel it really strongly here in Brazil.  People, they do not respect labor, the value things. So they always want to discount, but then they want to buy something visible that other people can see or imported car or whatever.

1:15:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think, yeah, here's very, very strong. If you can show it off, I can, I pay. See, if I can show it off, I don't pay.

1:15:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, good point. Well, there's things around that that you could do, right? But yeah, that's, that's an extra layer of things.

1:16:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So experiences in education so this is more about the personal aspect do have a book this is a classic question a book or a movie that really influenced your perspective on life three movies that comes to mind matrix uh-huh doon uh-huh the this one or the other one the the number two doon two number the from now not yeah from now doon number two and as well uh between there's a movie called free guy in a tv show called dark matter dark matter that it's about the traveling with kind of psychedelics dark matter you know those those come in in mind and about books uh i think there's there are 48 laws to power mm-hmm you're the second person in a week that says that  it's actually powerful there's the first book that I actually got from a friend and really love like the rules the mindset you know like it was detail it's it was so big it was one of the biggest book that I've read but I love it another one it's called cool is because I have like kind of a few but it's called the night with the rusty armor and the four agreements those are the release are really simple books but they're actually powerful I always leave conversations like this with a lot of books to read

1:18:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, I'm thinking that maybe this question, let's see if we can get something out of it. If you think about your formative experiences, this is last question, okay?  After this we just do a recap and you're free to go. If you think about your formative experiences, is there something uncommon around them?  Doesn't mean bad or good, just uncommon.

1:18:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thinking of my formative experiences, what is uncommon about them? What's uncommon? I know it's not what you expect, but I don't know if there's something uncommon.  They're just learning experiences.

1:19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But is there something that you've been through that most people don't go through?

1:19:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, maybe in one of my former educations, the retreat aspect of my certification, that it's an interesting way also of learning, just getting out of life and just concentrating in what you're learning and getting to know the people.  Maybe the retreat aspect, I don't know if it's uncommon, but that's why I do retreats. People are not also used to do retreats.  Retreats, you know, so I think that's one and another one. Let me rephrase the question.

1:20:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe maybe I didn't ask it in the best possible way Let's say let's imagine that You have Driven and a formula one car This is not common, but this is rare, but it's something that you have done that's part of your life and shaped your life So do you have like stuff like this that it's a good conversation started when you are at the party.  Oh, yeah It changed my life when I flew with virgin galactic and touch the space. What is this saying?

1:20:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe I have a pretty common life You know, I mean through like it if you could like I run formerly the experiences We're actually out of firm money of experiences  You know, but I think one of my most educational aspects is one I was not expecting that I was coaching a CDO.  know the brand Senkosut? It's a big corporate, it's a Palabela. No, I don't know. Well, it's, you know, like a big retailer that they have also stores in Brazil from Chile.  So I was working, you know, like on a spitaly with a CDO chief digital officer from that conglomerate that it's actually big, big, big.  So I didn't see like he was a heavy, heavy one, but he was and he invited me to Uruguay and I went there.  So he invited other CDOs and one founder and CEO for a really big, big company in Chile. And we took Silosaibin and we did like a kind of a group retreat to help me develop one of my  And for me, it was an expected to eat, actually, Silo Sayuin, with tech industry leaders in what they do and working at business model canvas.  it was a comma, but it was so much fun and so much learning about, like, I didn't have the word what we were doing, but now I know it's worth shopping, facilitating.  But the CEO, he owns a Ferrari and things. if someone I look up to and we were together and I was learning how to develop technology and he has a big company that develops technology, supported of Microsoft and he was telling me, you know, right now you're learning how to develop technology.  And I'm like, what the  is going on, you know, this is fun and I love it. And then we went to a party that's another kind aspect of the learning experience and, you know, like, this is how you celebrate when you develop technology.  It was really fun to have experience that it's uncommon to really be able to sit with people that have leadership like 400 to 500 people that would love to have that spot.  And I was not expecting this, and why are they giving me this so much information and value to me?  What do they see in me? So it was also like uncommon, unexpected, and right now we are really close friends.  They came to my wedding. So right now I'm developing another thing with them. But, you know, at the end, I think that was a really cool formative experience.  know, I learned more about developing business, not about learning in university how to be a manager, actually learning from there in just a psilocybin session of six hours and connecting about through the pains of others, you know, what they're going through and about their mindset about how to look things, to add value.  That was amazing.

1:24:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's exactly the sort of answer that was that sounds amazing.

1:24:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That sounds really good.

1:24:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah So we've touched on a lot of things and I think you've given I think me and perhaps also yourself a lot of to think about and For the next session what we will do is to Make sense of this stuff.  So it's we will use mostly these post-its And we'll just group them in different ways and see relations that pop up and we look at it from from the perspective of More process oriented aspect of things Right.

1:24:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's connecting connecting The architecture of these concepts is basically what we will be doing But we needed these bricks to build that in the next session.  Can I ask you how well are you? I'm 37 Nice Thank you

1:25:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  thank you for answering that no problem it was it was unexpected question yeah but people ask me that a lot because i think i look younger i don't know but ask me that um i wonder you 30 30 see everybody i meet today is is younger than me i'm feeling um connected to the fountain of youth i had a great conversation today with someone else and then then during the conversation we were talking and this guy was like i don't know 12 years younger than me and i was like interesting it was very mature so this is what we did today we got a little first pass at what's legible from you from the outside so your website and the psychedelic integration framework you send me that stuff i saw some some patterns there right  uh are you are you seeing me yes okay okay so we did that and then we collected significant inputs for the business perspective and we did the same for the personal perspective so all of these things they were on purpose it probably notices about the questions the questions all of them had a bit of a break inside of them what is something that is something but all of the questions are like this this connection that forces us to think about an unexpected way right and for the next session we will make sense of these things I would like to invite you you don't have to do this but I think it's better if you do schedule some time in your agenda in your own calendar and come back here and look at these things and explore this and just feel give yourself some give yourself some time so that in the next session we don't arrive at this with just a week  of time. So just come back, navigate a little bit and see if something makes more sense to you.

1:27:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
