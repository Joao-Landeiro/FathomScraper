0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello. Hello.

0:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. How are you doing? Good.

0:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good. Much better.

0:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Thank you.

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

0:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay.

0:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Anyway, so is it just you, I and Mustafa?

0:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think Mustafa is not joining. And then even is really trying to get our product launched. So, yeah. I messed up.  thought I told my I just met with one of our investors and I was like, yeah, our product is launching on Thursday.  He's like, wasn't it supposed to last much a few weeks ago? And I'm like, . That's what I told him because I thought it was going to be January when we launched.  I was like, no, it's launching on Thursday.

0:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's okay. I tried to make it up.

0:54 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But yeah, we're launching. So he's like really like even on trying to get the product launched and everything.

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, yeah makes sense. So what would be the most useful thing for you right now? I think one is around the controls.

1:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I feel like we don't we're missing something in the controls and maybe it's just me or maybe like to check that out and then also plan to make sure we have everything for controls ready for like design wise and then also for third party management we should also kind of discuss that too because I know that's an important part of it to make sure we have that process drawn out.  Got it.

1:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then maybe even the integrity hub too. So changing this. Okay, so controls. So for controls, have the home thing that I think Romeo is working on.  We need to build this thing, which is the view inside of the specific control, and this is just a draft to convey the idea, but it's not the design.  We need to show what's happening with that control, which means that, which is actually this thing, right? So these two stages happen on the same spot.  They decide to send control to someone, internal or external. which should be this thing, this menu or this option, like dots, click there, I need to send this to someone.  Then there's the explanation that the. And when when they have done they've gone through these steps, they now they get this screen, which is okay, you'll be sending this to someone.  Again, this is just a style, not the content, you'll be sending this.

3:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  One is more like the content, like do we have all the right things for each of the different ones like all of the different forms that we had and kind of like the steps for each of them.  So the forms.

4:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm opening JIRA, so many cables, the forms. So we have a couple of things now in review, Romeo finished a lot of things.  Okay, so we have a form for incident reporting, have a form for environmental improvement suggestions, we have a form for documentation requests.  We need to check with Ivan, I suppose we don't because they are running for the for the deploy, but Ivan said that we wouldn't need the design for now as long as we had a single source of truth for the other forms, the ones that were these ones, right?  Yeah. this information. I don't know if they have it now, I would assume no because of the launch, but you can check.  I didn't update it so maybe there's no sources for these things, but I don't know. So as the compliance officer agrees to send the thing, the thing is sent, again, it's just reusing the same component, changing the text, which is the easy part.  The selected audience receives an email. You don't have this email design, but this is basically content as well in terms of text.  Then that email has a button. They can click that button, and it'll taken to the controls that's this kind of thing.  Inside of the portal.

5:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Then they can confirm the sending.

5:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I need to put up here like a confirmation pop-up, and that's the flow because then when they send the compliance officer on this thing, they can see the status either of the whole thing, or more granularly like, all that company did the thing, the other company did not do that.  I think. Is this the long lines of what you were expecting?

6:07 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hello, I think it's more that we need to draw out the I'm not like document change form like what is the step for them to suddenly go in and check in and like into the information on why you use a document trade change forms you know or forms the internal employee like I just feel like we don't have it thought through like the whole process for that okay they go to controls where do we explain where that is and then just go there and then we and then I don't understand what do mean they just go to controls like I guess a whole flow like okay you can't control it goes here document change request or does it go somewhere else before it goes to document change request or form one like where do these fit in to the overall flow for controls because even is very much like I need to know exactly which one it is you know like like where does it fit into the process  Or are we missing one and maybe I just need to visualize it because I don't see the whole thing and that's why I'm confusing but like you know like you have like what you just showed on the there it's like missing pictures for that so I guess that is what Romeo needs to create and then we can see if it's has everything.  Yeah, yeah, these pictures.

7:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I agree. These pictures are missing, but the reason why and this picture will be done but the reason why we focus on doing the forms now because the forms were completely new and we didn't have them and the pictures is like we will need this thing.  Yeah, this is a little bit more work, but the other things are basically changing text on things we already have.  So that's much, much closer to complete right.

7:46 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm not I'm not saying it's done.

7:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm just showing you the overall process. Okay, like how far are we are we

8:04 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, I don't know. just feel like, okay, for how far away are we from him making those so that we can go and see if it's the right thing for that, for development?  Okay, yes.

8:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. I would have to check with him and check with him today.

8:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Because where are those points of the missing boxes in the to-dos, I guess? Which one is that one? Hello?

8:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is a trade-off I'm thinking about, okay? So either we move faster by separating the way it looks and which text goes inside of it, and in this way it  to be very fast, because it's the same thing we've used here. Let's reuse it again, and that kind of thing.  Or we move a little bit slower. I'm not saying just slower. And we get full clarity on the flow before coding the flow.  Before coding or designing the flow, what do you mean? Because there's one at just the forms. And like Ivan said, the forms, it doesn't matter.

9:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We have a template, just put the forms in. So it's all in the place.

9:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're going to keep that.

9:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't need that.

9:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But the flow to get to the forms and after the forms, that needs to be created, that it makes sense for the user.

9:41 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think those aren't created. I guess that's kind of the thing. It's like, where is that on the list?  Because maybe he should prioritize getting that kind of flow first in so that we at least know whether or not we are missing a flow or not.  Because it's really hard to tell by paper. Like just reading the text, like whether or not. or missing something in the flow to design.  Mm-hmm.

10:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. where is the thing, Controls? Controls. Show this tab. OK, so the whole flow is here, right? And OK, OK.  I don't think it, yeah. Let's just make, I'll just talk to Romeo and we prioritize making the whole flow.  This would stop other things, right? Yeah, but I think don't we need them for development?

10:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We need the flow, no? Because like, from my feeling with Ivan, it's like he always wants to see every picture before, even if it takes five minutes like that.  He said something of the form because they really have a design for the form, but like the overall flow, he wants to see them.

10:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's my understanding of how

11:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  even works but maybe it's not so yeah so the thing okay let's do that I'll do that I'll work on that with Romeo and we show it to even um yep we can do that for sure so do we have that for all of the different flows then you have the information you need to be able to do that breakdown of the it's for every control is kind of the same right I don't know it's like one is like asset management right like it's like you have your computers and we have an asset management register but we really haven't thought about like maybe that is like just deploy it to an employee like deploy it to the person in charge of asset management maybe that's what it is and that's the control I'm not sure but it could be and then there's like an employee like whatever form like maybe that could go in we and also we don't know if the form like the information is correct  done finding the cloud, we need to kind of test that and I'm wondering if we should also manually test it with some of our customers before we try to code it, whether or not that's the right directions too.  Okay, so there's a couple of things, a couple of things in the air.

12:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's let's test out a few things just connecting here on mirror.

12:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh, Ivan said he's actually going to join the meeting in the few minutes.

12:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  if Ivan joins the meeting, I'll give priority to whatever questions he might have because maybe he cannot stay for the whole thing and the laundry stays here, the laundry stays not coding, if that's okay.  Okay, so I'll now come into it, okay, and just here, here, here, here, here, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, nice, okay, where is that thing?  First of all, controls, okay, so one of the things that we, I understand from what you're telling me is, okay, there's several types of controls, right,  And some controls are, they might follow the same sort of flow, and others might have changes to that flow.

14:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK.

14:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let's prioritize the ones that we suspect that are the most different. And then we make sure that the ones that seem to be the most different are nailed down.  then we move on to the ones that we are more confident on. OK. For the button's list. OK. OK.  Let's go with this, isn't it? Yeah. And then most of the keys, please. OK, cool. So do you see these postings?  Yeah.

14:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  OK.

14:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me see. On the first row, I suppose this is E, this is E, this is E, so I'll change the E is to green, big cliche.

15:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  This one.

15:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's E, and the one next to it is E.

15:21 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  the one to the left, all three of those are E. Okay. And then that's all E, like that's E, yeah.  Okay, so. Internal audit, yeah, those are all ISO, I wouldn't say it's necessary to E, but that's like E is what we're doing.  I know I got it.

15:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so.

15:48 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I got it. And then the minutes of the form is more reporting. And then.

16:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then stakeholder analysis and legal and other requirements, those two are more risk assessment and then the document change request form is E for ISO, guess, same with the asset, asset register.  Okay. This one is also you, I suppose. Yeah, are they the same thing?

16:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The assets register.

16:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, those are the same thing.

16:43 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, because where is that the environmental aspects on the top in green that one should actually be in risk assessment environmental aspect analysis.  Just a second.

16:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Which one? one?

16:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  The environmental aspect analysis above environmental improvement. Okay. One should be in risk assessment.

17:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So let me change that section. Okay, and these other ones, this one's behind.

17:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, those are mainly G. Okay.

17:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, but all of these, these are also controls, right? These stuff are not controls. Yeah.

17:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And these are controls, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, controls for S is maybe more like, oh, it should be also sponsorships and donation, but it could be like donation hours or something like, or like donation and volunteer hours.  But that's like, we could add that maybe or diversity stuff, but I don't know if we want to put that in there yet.  Yeah, health and safety. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah, I was saying for S it could be under for social controls, could be like health and safety, could be it could be donation, it could be volunteering hours, but you could also wait on those two.  Okay.

19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's focus on this. Which one would you like to see end-to-end? We can do more than one, but which one is keeping you up at night?

19:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Maybe asset IT register.

19:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's try to see how asset IT register would work.

19:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I guess it's a little bit like... Maybe it's like carbon reporting office, but I don't know if we have carbon reporting office all the way right either.  How would we know? Maybe that's what we should spend some time on because that's a quite key one. I wonder if I should bring Bryton into this call to talk about...  Yeah, because I think I sent it to you right before you went, you drove back, you drove back, you went back home, you went back home about the carbon, how carbon is calculated in a company, like Scope 1 and 2, and the process of it, and how do we gather the right information that we can report on that.  Okay, so I'm opening that email.

20:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is the carbon calculator for the Excel sheet, the data calculator information, the word documented. Okay. So this is related to carbon reporting?

20:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No, I'm just wondering, maybe we should give up on IT asset register because that's more of like the lower risk control.  think the one that we need to get right is around carbon reporting. Brighton, are you there? So I just brought you into this call.  I don't hear anyone I don't know if you know but Brighton intern from Singapore who's moved to Norway for six months.

21:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi Brighton.

21:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hi nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So Zhao helps organize and working with the UX team in Brazil but also helps organize processes that we have.  And I wanted to talk about the because you had looked into the carbon reporting within the offices you know that process which N had been working on and I'm wondering if you can maybe walk and we also shared some documents with Zhao right before he traveled back to Brazil last week but I'm wondering if you can maybe walk  through like some of the documents that we have and explain how they're calculated on one information that we're collecting.  Brighton, if you want to, and we also, I feel like we had a recording from Anne also talking about it, but I think Brighton, you, maybe you, you spend some time with Anne also working on this too, right?  yeah. Okay. Okay.

22:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So to give you a little bit more context on my side and my questions, Brighton, but we are entering this design the controls aspect.  We are designing the controls section and the flows of the controls for the platform. And some controls are probably they probably follow the same kind of path.  And some others might be a little bit different, right? And for the ones follow a simple path, we're not so worried right now, but we would like to understand a little bit more, which ones are perhaps different.  And covering reporting everything. Related to carbon reporting is really sensitive. So we wanted to make sure that we got that right and We do have some design stuff done for the way it looks the carbon reporting for the offices and Hello Right, do you hear me?

23:27 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  yes, I can.

23:28 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan
  I think you can.

23:29 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I hear he's frozen. Yeah Did my vehicle cut off?

23:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, he froze a little bit and that Okay, uh, I gotta say this only happens to me on teams.  don't know if anyway, I'll I'll say No, no, we could just could just stay here, but uh, I've tested it  So I love Microsoft and so sorry, right. The idea, it's my understanding that you've researched and studied this carbon reporting flow, and maybe you are now a kind of subject matter expert on this flow, on this call.

24:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is that kind of accurate?

24:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Maybe not an expert, but I do understand how it works. It's a big word, it's a big word. Okay, so can you please tell me how it works so we can just draft the flow of it and see if what we have matches what it should be?

24:36 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan
  it mainly works on the Excel sheet. Would you like me to share my screen?

24:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, and yeah, you can share your screen and I'll use my iPad.

24:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So just to give you some background while Brighton sets up is that in the summer last year, we reached out to a consultant on Upwork around scope one, two, and  partially three emissions and how do you calculate that so that we can think about how we would build a tool for it.  he gave us this consultant on Upwork gave us how he did it and it was all like kind of in an Excel with the formula that we could later on code you know to get the right numbers in it but focusing on scope one and two and waste as scope three emissions like and that's not that's the only one there so he gave this Excel spreadsheet which is like trying to collect certain information and maybe we need to rethink this but if you remember there's like this carbon reporting I don't know if you've also seen a Brighton on Figma it was like an old design of like you know collecting information like a checklist because one of our customers and that don't want to be like tell me what you need to collect so I can go in and ask and so and created this old carbon reporting checklist maybe if it's just show I don't think Brighton unless she's very familiar she might not I know I'm trying to I don't know where to  where our thing is so like, oh now Figma just froze. Do you hear me? I hear you, yes.

26:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know.

26:10 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I don't know if you know where it is, Giao, but it might be where the carbon reporting is. You might have put it into the old, next to the old version.  think I have it.

26:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I have it. It's, see if you can open this link. I'd be pleased to see if I got the right thing.

26:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, let me see. Yeah, so I don't know if you've seen this one either, like, so and created this being like, okay, here's an example of what you need based off of the information that's required.  And maybe Brighton, you can take this link also and like, see what it is. But I don't think this is totally right.

26:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we never tested this.

26:51 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like because this was just an example that we sent and they like, and they never built in. But it's like, you know, where does your company operate?  You could drop down. and then which of the following best describes are you renting co-working space, what type of electricity, natural gas, and then you're supposed to add your monthly electricity bills here.  I don't know if that's a good idea or just like to put in a number, and then during this reporting period they have the incident of fire, fire suppression system, and then do lease cars, you know, what country, do you have any remote workers, and then like, and then categorize both organic and then like calculating upload your waste bills.  I don't necessarily not sure if this is the right thing, but this was trying to collect the stuff in an Excel in a better way, and so maybe we can now go to the Excel file that Brighton was showing to see like if that's really what you're supposed to be collecting, but this was like made very quickly when a customer was like, hey, tell us what we need to get, and we're like, okay, let's try putting this together, but we don't really know if it's right.  And then Romeo kind of took this and like put it into a new design, but not sure that this is the information and maybe we need Brighton to check like what we need in the cell is actually the information that we need to collect in a way.  Oh and I see Yvonne here but Yvonne we're just kind of going we can wait because I know you're going here in the middle of the launch so we can prioritize your your comments in here but we're just going to go through the carbon reporting for controls but Yvonne is there anything Yeah how is the how is the launch going?  Can you hear us Yvonne or can you hear us Yvonne? You are mute.

28:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  okay so Brighton Brighton and I think when she's testing and checking the content so when she has when you Brighton have something but please let me know we can start fixing it that's one part and the second part is I'm waiting on the list of organizations or pilots to start telling them so that's all.  I thought we already have that right well I just gave it to Brighton right Brighton you sent the Are you able to send it now, Brighton, like, okay, you send it now.

29:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, send it in Content Channel, as we have it now.

29:11 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Or somewhere, so it's born, can't say it doesn't matter, I'll speak with Werner, so he can edit it. But basically, other than that, I think most of the bugs that we reported on the document are fixed, I would say like 90% of them are fixed, yeah.

29:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I would say we are ready for now, but I would like to test more of it.

29:29 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I'm waiting on Brighton also, and I will also test it a bit later myself, and everything to see how we're doing, yeah.  But I would say we are close to being ready. And I also noticed some issue with slowness, but it seemed to be okay now, I investigated it, but it fixed itself, I'm thinking it's some cash issues.

29:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for now, for now, it's okay. If I notice it again, then I'll investigate it again. But for now, everything seems good, so it should be okay.

29:55 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Let me know if you noticed such things.

29:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, of course.

29:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. So I think the sending of the reminders still doesn't work.

30:10 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan
  So if I have an uncompleted task and I send myself a reminder, it doesn't appear. You mean email doesn't appear?

30:18 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

30:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's no email. Okay.

30:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

30:20 - Brighton Wong Jia Xuan
  We are working on the emails. Born and setting up emails right now.

30:25 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  that's, that's a working progress to have to get in touch with him and check about that. But that's the only thing currently is not set up 100% yet.  It works.

30:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It is set up. just need to figure it out, I Okay.

30:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay. So then, then even in terms of kind of controls, yeah, like you guys have enough to start. So we are going to try to break down carbon reporting now because I feel like we're not getting the right information.  But is there anything? Yeah. I already started today, think, or we'll start today.

31:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  your tomorrow on controls homepage. think that is pretty clear that one is straight forward if I'm not mistaken. So he will update it to have the similar look and feel to the policies control communications pages.

31:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So that it's that colors and those boxes at the top. That's it, that's the first task. After that, I'll check it, Figma and see what's next, but I think we'll soon after that, we'll run out of the task.  So we have to check what's available there. Yeah, and that was the question that I guess we had Richelle like because there are some forms that are ready and we're like and you had mentioned, you don't need to change too much the design of the forms because we have a lot of forms.

31:40 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We can input the forms, but regarding workwise forms, we just create them and that's it.

31:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's some work we need to do, but it's not much, I would say.

31:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Maybe the forms are not long if I'm not mistaken, at least these standard ones. I say it's an hour or hour or four or maybe hour or two per form, something like that.

31:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So then we need to have more, do we have more? And then Joe, ready to launch, because then we're talking when do you need more like Thursday, Ivan, or is that what you're saying?  you guys will be something like that approximately.

32:11 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I'm expecting some bugs and feedback related to the release.

32:14 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I'm expecting some really bear also.

32:17 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I'm not too worried that we'll have nothing to do. So I think probably Thursday at the of week, something like that, we'll probably need more things and controls to start working on to not.  So we don't need to get from the other kind But it all quite depends on the further release goals.

32:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's really important.

32:35 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  If there are some bugs, some issues that we've overseen, and things like that, we probably have a whole week of work for that.  We'll see.

32:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That depends. Because at least we'll start to get feedback now from people who would never actually use this and like completely new pair of eyes and actually a lot of them.

32:52 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So I'd say we'll get really interesting feedback from there. So it will be interesting to see. Yeah. My.

33:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And my feeling is that like they're like, don't think I don't like because we're going to release on Thursday, I guess is like, they're not going to look at it for a while.  Like so we might not like actually get immediate feedback, just knowing them and help us see they are and I'm probably going to have to chase to get some kind of feedback and like maybe some meetings with them the the following week.  But I guess they're like, how do we have enough then like by Thursday, like on the list or like, do we want to show you on like what we have on what he needs or what or can he they can they, you know, start on the integrity hub and start building the integrity hub or I don't know, like what is what I would stick with controls.  I think we are not that far off.

33:39 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think I think some of the things and parts of the flows, maybe we can start working on depends on the pace we have regarding the release and depends on the design pace.

33:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think we can maybe try to compliance map or something.

33:52 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I'm just like, I'm a little bit worried. Yeah, there is a lot that like, that Romeo needs to design, I think, like

34:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I believe it's less than what it appears to you.

34:05 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But we can check this now because I think the question of does Ivan have enough?

34:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's only the development team that can answer. And we can work it out together, for sure.

34:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I guess my point is that Ivan needs a design to be able to develop. do we have it?  course. Yeah, yeah. the question is not, João, do we have a design?

34:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The question is, Ivan, the documentation we have right now allows you to move out far. So I think this is the question we should ask, Ivan.  mean, how far can you move the things we have right now? what's missing that we can...

34:40 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Can we maybe take a look together at the current controls? For sure. Do you prefer the Figma?

34:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, maybe Figma is best to be visual.

34:51 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  It's a good question.

34:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I agree. So, opening the Figma, this is not the right file. I just had a different thing opened. Yeah, sure.  Fortify.

35:09 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So I know there's stuff we must do, okay? I'm not saying we will.

35:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I understand.

35:15 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  let's see just what we can work on. That's my goal of this. I just saw this. Yeah, we can zoom to the latest control to the left.  So yeah, I said this isn't ready and I already told Azar and I'll create a task that this is something we'll work on next, right?  I think that everyone can agree with that.

35:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I believe so. Yeah, Yeah, so yeah, one question to Abby. Can you zoom in, Jao, please, on this height, top right corner of this page, any page of this?

35:43 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  This height instructions. Should we apply this to all of our, we have multiple pages where we have this layout.  So do you want us to apply this to all of them?

35:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's not the most urgent, but I guess eventually. We would need to do that. Okay. Okay.

36:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Low priority then.

36:03 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  No problem. Okay.

36:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. But yeah, so regarding controls from my view, I see that this is ready to go and I think we are good here, but other parts are not yet if I'm not mistaken.

36:13 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So my question would be what else can we do? We said that we can start creating couple of forms like those forms to the right side, these forms.  think the ones that are ready, we can start with those and that's okay.

36:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And my question is there anything else other than that that we can work on? Maybe not today.

36:37 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I don't think so. At the end of the week? Yes.

36:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  let's get specific.

36:47 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  We don't need work today, maybe not even tomorrow, but maybe like Thursday, Friday, something like that will probably need something.

36:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So yeah, so this thing is not designed. is that there's just a mock-up but this is not I don't think it's ready for you guys to take it and I think this this will be a big a big component let's say a big a big a big section from which many other things depend on so I think this is the key thing is what I would focus on right now and do you agree yeah I mean that's the homepage of a control yeah yeah and did I freeze okay I'm back yeah okay and so these three interactions here at the top they all happen inside of this thing so if we fix if we address this thing we we get it all the way here okay this interaction here the component is ready we  don't have what's the text that goes inside of this explanation, right? Are you familiar with this, Yvonne? Do you remember this?  You're... I don't hear you. I think you might be frozen too.

38:16 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Oh no, he's thinking. He's okay, okay. Are you on mute? Something wrong with his sound, he's okay. Yeah. you

39:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now you are on mute, but it might work if you are on mute. Can you hear me now? Yeah.  Yeah.

39:13 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes, yes, yes.

39:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So my phone was connected. I'm not sure what teams it is. Okay.

39:19 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So yes, I'm familiar with this. Okay. It's just like intro to each control so that people can know some kind of onboarding or something like that.  More information. How could you use the app? Correct.

39:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this is really important. We're putting this on the admin view. Right? I'm a compliance officer. I'm checking the control X, Y, Z.  And I need to send that control to somebody else, like some supplier. But I'm a new compliance officer. I haven't been doing this for a long time.  I get this explanation. Right? This explanation is something that I see, not the guy that is filling in the form.  So what this explanation tells me is. And this, okay, this is an important bit. This explanation, we need to have content like next for each different control.  And Abby, we can figure this out afterwards. It's not complex. But so it basically says, hey, dear compliance officer, what you'll be doing now is just sending this control to other people and they will do something with it and you'll get, know, just explaining that process, right?  And then the compliance officer can see a way of sending that control to the people that will fill it in.  And then we confirm that it has been sent. And then there's an email which has not been designed, I, this is question for Ivan.  Do you need the design of the email or do you need the text of the email?

40:51 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Let's go with the text for now. Let's use the similar template for emails. And then I think Abby also wanted to do a bit of revamp on the email design, but let's maybe  Let's postpone that to like a bit later just so that we can get control. I would rather use the same similar layout that we currently have and just update the text.  You got it. And then after we've revamped the email design, then we can do it all over the place.  If you all agree with that, yes.

41:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the selected audience receives the email. There's a button. They click the button and the button takes them to the forms and the forms are these forms, right?  These forms and the forms from the US is nice. Yes. And when they finish the forms, they should have something that is kind of like this, but also the content is different business is the same kind of component, which is a confirmation.  Hey, you're going to send this form.

41:47 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  People will check on it.

41:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is not designed ready. Okay, because it's slightly different, but just to give a feeling of what kind of things the flow entails, right?  If we zoom out, do you have specific questions, Eva, and other things that you would like us to do?  No.

42:07 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  This explanation before the end, we talk about this will be only for control. I'm talking about this explanation. Admin user, see the explanation.

42:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  When does this pop up?

42:19 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  That's my question. So let's role play it.

42:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm an admin, and I say, oh, I want to check out this control, and I click here, and this takes me to the view of that control.  Yes.

42:32 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes. Hello.

42:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hello. Okay, froze.

42:40 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  And he has trouble with things.

42:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

42:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This thing, that tells me, hey, you're about to see. It cuts you off or you're frozen for a bit, but you stop when you open Controls page.

43:05 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  we are now at Controls page. To control page, one single control page, so like that control, yeah, there, yeah.

43:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we get here and we can check the status of the different people and organizations that are subject to control.  I see, okay, this guy is about to expire. I should remind them or send them a renewal for that control.  And I three dots menu, I click on the thing like request update, you can change the copy on this, basically it's the same thing.  And then this takes me to this thing, where it explains to me, the compliance officer, something like, hey, you're just about to ask these guys to send you more information for this control.  This is what will happen. You will send them the control, they'll see it on the email, they'll fill it in, you get the status of that.  You know you see the whole process. Are you okay with that?

44:03 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  You want to move forward?

44:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Yes I want to send the control to these guys Okay, okay. Yeah, okay So it seems to me that this is the most crucial thing that is probably holding back the most complex one I would say yes It's impossible to miss Okay, so regarding controls.  This is what we We have Go ahead.

44:38 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  I think you're missing Maybe you're missing a trick in this whole Flow we need Approvals are different not mistaken.  Hold on things are starting to mix in my head. Yeah, but yeah, you need approvals Or not approvals if you need Accept or reject actions we did discuss it in the last meeting  but maybe we're not mentioning it again. once you have a control setup deployed, that's one part done, then the control like gift registry, can use your employee reports a gift.  And then some kind of line manager, or officer compliance officer, or someone has to accept or reject that gift.  This is like a summary of the process. It has a little bit more steps in it, just of it.  Basically, we need a way to do that. We currently have that implemented in the system, but it's a revamped to look like the new design and everything.

45:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  yeah, we can go through it if you want. Actually, no, I'm not sure if it's working because we didn't test it, but we have most of the logic and everything.

45:48 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But basically, when someone submits a control, then someone needs to review it.

45:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So say, okay, I reject this, or this is not good or something like that. So yeah, understood. So my understanding on that is okay, got it.  We will need to update the design. My understanding on that is the task, the status. Yeah, okay, let me think about this.  Yeah, these are two controls.

46:20 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  one that you showed me was the ones that are once a year, for example, and then you have to request someone to fill it in.  That's like, okay, the death flow is good.

46:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now, even the death flow needs an approval, the guy can send it once a year wrong, so they all need the approval, right?  So I'm agreeing with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:42 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  So then that's okay. So we have, sorry, someone entered the ops. So we have those that you have once a year and then this flow that you made makes sense because then you have to require a, oh, you didn't fill it in, the deadline is 1st of January, please fill it in.  It makes sense, but they're the ones that are type of ongoing though there's the second type of control for second type of distinguishing controls is ongoing ones and those are the ones that once deployed are active for a year I don't know and then at any point in time employee can come in and report something and then on those you don't have to remind them to do something usually it's more like you train them to do it when it happens and then when it happens they need to report it and then you as I don't know main person is possible for that you have to accept or reject or comment on it that's the process and it can be done from here is we just need to distinguish the look and feel of a control that's like said once a year that you have to fill in like hey Zhao okay I'll be hey Brighton please fill in this control by the 1st of January and then the second one will be hey Zhao hey I behave right and we have this control I'm back now okay so I hope you

48:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  who said the answer.

48:01 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But basically, you have two different types of controls that we need to also differentiate the UI a little bit for, because for one, important part will be not too much different UI.

48:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's probably the same.

48:15 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  But for once, you don't have some reminder action. But for the other, it makes sense to have them. That's the difference, maybe.  We have a basic understanding of that mechanic.

48:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We don't have design for everything. But I can show you the basic understanding just to make sure that it's worth it to put design on this.  Because if the mechanic is wrong, there's just a waste of time. Can I share my screen?

48:40 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yeah.

48:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. So here, share this tab. OK. Every form, every kind of data collection thing must be subjected to an approval because people write wrong stuff all the time.  And one of the ways we about this was let's say this is the view of the employee okay this is just an example some form okay doesn't matter view of the employee this is the view of the approver okay if you want the future this can be different so they see the same thing but then they see the comment box approved on not approved approved yeah so how do they get to this place right i think this is a bit of your question how do they find this this this spot but you get this design from sorry this was from those forms screenshots right yeah this was this this was from an updated Romeo head of our original okay okay okay i think so i think so okay so the the approval the approval flow as different stages this is the kind of the last stage the stage of i know i'm now seeing information that i need to react to right but how do i know which information i need to

50:00 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  active, right?

50:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the thought behind this was, and I think we discussed this together. mean, just so many calls get confused.  Which is, remember that we've discussed about making the employee portal kind of the same thing. Do you see my tab?  Yes. Okay. So as a compliance officer, maybe I'm on the wrong one. Where's the one that says latest. As a compliance officer, I see this thing, right?  And I see some tasks that I need to keep track of. Correct? Yes. Okay. So that's how you know that there's a couple of forms pending your approval.  Okay. you are, you are a compliance officer and you see, oh, some guys submitted a conflict of interest form and they are waiting on my approval and I can check it.  And when I click there, I'm taken to this And I think this must be better documented for sure, but just to show that the logic holds.  I'm taking to this thing and I say, oh, that's what they put in. So let me see. Yeah, I agree or I don't agree.  I write something on a comment and I send it, right? So that's the approval for that. I think this approval flow probably works for everything, just especially for the V1, just add a comment box, approve, don't approve, and transform that into a task.  Okay, yeah, sounds good to me.

51:33 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Can I show you just what we have? Sure, for sure. So if you, so this is the simplified flow because in the flow you have to have two approvals actually.  yeah, can you click on my icon on the Enfigma, go to Enfigma and find me in Enfigma, more pro developer actually, find the divide circle is.

51:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, that one, click on it. It should load you to iteration one.

52:02 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Try refreshing, maybe or something. we're Nice, nice. Okay, so basically what I want to show is this, this is the design I don't hear you.

52:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't you.

52:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  hear him. Yeah, but basically this is, can you hear me now?

52:24 - Ivan Celic (fortifai.co)
  Yes, but let's change links.

52:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you guys try to join this one, please? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, see you there, see you there. Hello.  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, Brighton. Thank you everyone for joining me here.
