0:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Hello. Hi Jorge. Hi, are you?

0:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not thirsty anymore. Not thirsty anymore. I got you just right when you were drinking your water.

0:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Is it water? We'll never know.

0:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it's water. It's water. No alcohol, right?

0:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, not right now.

0:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I know. I've never tried actually. Maybe it would make me a little bit lighter on my feet. I do drink alcohol sometimes, but not very often.

0:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have 81 days without alcohol. Nice. Do you feel the difference in your sleep?

0:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Actually not. No?

0:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I actually don't see a big difference.

0:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because I at the start of this year. I went, I think 90 something days because of all the Twitter bros were saying that I would feel so much, you know.

1:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Everything's marketing right. Yeah, everything's marketing for sure.

1:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  everything it's up to see what you believe it.

1:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, everything works for sure. I just got this book. It's called Visual Thinking Works.

1:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's in Spanish.

1:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's not in English, but it's by Rafa Vivas. He's the Spanish, you could say that the partner of Explain.  Explain was founded by Dave Gray, actually, but it was, I am learning that through the book, but the one that took it to the next level was Eric Wood.  is the CEO. Sorry. And what I love about the book is actually what I'm trying to go in forward with what I'm doing, you know, like, it's the visual technology, you know, like when Steve Jobs came with the idea of making colorful icons and things like that, it's having the visual things that promote learning and promote creativity.  It promotes a divergent thinking, lots of things, know, but not all of the people are lean to visual technology, that it's visual thinking, you know, it's kind of design thinking, but visual thinking is what makes it visible and it aligns everything else, you know, that's why I'm looking out for the framework, but this is, it's teaching me more about the framework, you know, it's, you know, also, it's not about drawing, it's about learning what to use and what to use it, depending on what story you want to That's all with the graphics, right?  So it's interesting skill, you know, like, I'm working to develop that, you know, because I'm used to do my mappings, but it's not about just my ma...  It's a bad diagram. It's about looking at the information visually so I don't know it. I just find it interesting that I wanted to share it but I also didn't know that Dave Gray was the founder but he he doesn't have like this the entrepreneurship skills you know he's just like an inventor of visual thinking and he's like a wizard but he doesn't know about maybe well that's my thought right about business because the one that took it to the next level was Ari Wood becoming the and I think he sold the company.

3:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah yeah Dave sold the company I think 2013 or something around that time and I actually met Rafael Vivas we we spoke um I think yeah and there's also the woman I don't remember her name she's also Spanish I think she speaks Spanish I think she's Spanish from Spain.  There's from Spain I think. Yeah and It's so funny because I was just before a little bit earlier today.  I was checking out that book to get it So I'll just let you check it out and then and then I'll see what you think.  I've been you know studying this one Inking visually, okay So this one is a little bit more It looks more Technical yeah, it's more technical.  Yeah, if you look at the Background of the guy it comes from like process engineering and stuff like that and there's also this one In English is called whiteboard selling Okay Nice and this was written by some software dudes and It's I haven't really gone as deep into this this one the whiteboard selling But How do you find it so far?  You I like the fact that it is not written by visual traditional visual people so I like the fact that it was written by people that you know they needed to sell complex stuff and then they figured out a way of doing that because they were selling like cloud services and stuff like that.  Would you recommend it.

5:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I recommend I think this one better because which.

5:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

5:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  From Malcolm Craig.

5:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I think this one also is really good in terms of choosing. They're like that diagram.

5:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like I love to do that but I don't know if it's enough and it's it's you know like like like learning to do my math like I think diagrams and all of those things are also like.  It's interesting I don't know. Yeah it is. I would say because that's a skill that I really want to develop and I was looking at myself you know like personal growth.  or professional growth, it's like, or personal development or professional development is the same as product development. How do you choose with the future?  you want to work first, you know, because at the end you want to make yourself your iPhone, your iPhone, you know, there's so many things that you could fix, you know, but what are the majority of the people looking to be better, you know, because sometimes the aesthetics, the outside are not any, but it's the software, know, the capacity, the capabilities and things like that.

6:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, now this one, in that case, I think I recommend this one really, this one, okay, because it really helps you figure out like what is the thing that you're trying to say, and depending on that, say or explore, sometimes it talks about just thinking with visuals, right, not just communicating with visuals, and depending on the sort of situation you are in, it recommends different diagrams, like, oh, you're doing this, for that, this is the best diagram, you know, and I think it's it's

7:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It will be like kind of the same as this one because, you know, if he says the diagrams is if you just want to like share one inside, use, use the first graph.  you want to inside, use the pie graph. If you want to share three inside, use the right radar, you know, and yes, and now it's, I like the dispersion tool.  You know, if you want to, you know, maybe applying it to the psychedelic integration, you know, like, you know, the dispersion one, it's like a kind of a bulk loss and minus.  And I was thinking, you know, like, I have my notes here. I was thinking, like, okay, what happens if you like put the table.  And if you want to integrate a value or an activity, I put them there and in the one side energy in the thousand, it's commitment, you know, like.  What gives you more commit, like it's a way to evaluate which thing you could commit and as well it gives you full energy, you know.  So that's why you are going to evaluate, okay, maybe I to integrate this. Of all the insights that I have, this is the most valuable one.  So I was thinking that like as a framework too.

8:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We will use something like that today, so we'll see it in action. But yeah, there's a lot of, I've been trying to integrate the different frameworks for frameworks, like this kind of thinking you said.  And yeah, it's really interesting. find it fascinating. So I'm excited that you've been, you know, looking into this because I think, yeah, you're just more ready than usual.  So our discussion should be more productive even. So can I send you the link? Yes.

8:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

8:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, by the way, your trip went well, your travel. I'm what you you needed to travel was it okay?

9:04 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I travel I just came by yesterday and like I Like I woke up at 3 a.m. But I landed at 11 a.m.  Yes, but from Wednesday to Sunday I was doing like a private experiences that everybody loved the experience, you know nice nice Very good.

9:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you have the Instagram? I? Do I don't use it a lot, but I do have an Instagram I'll just send you the mirror link and then my Instagram name Let's do that.

9:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that's my Instagram But you don't have it's like a more personal but you don't have like no, I don't I Well, I'm just gonna follow you if you want to follow me like yeah, I think yeah, yeah for sure Because I have this love hate

10:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  relationship with Instagram It's really Cruel like if you stop posting you disappear. You need to keep posting all the time which is tiring but anyway Let me see.  Did you join the middle world?

10:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes Okay, no wait, I just I'm just following you first on Instagram. Okay. Okay. Hey, what's image metal?

10:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Imagine mental mental image was the name of the company that I had around visual thinking So for a couple of years, I think five years my job my my my company was about visual thinking Visual facilitation and stuff like that going to a lot of conferences that that sort of thing and Is an interesting job because you get paid to learn a lot of interesting stuff but at some point You realize that at least I realized that my  favorite part was the coffee break to talk to the keynote speakers because I wanted to know more and I wanted them to know that I was understanding what they were saying and then I realized you know what I think I want to go into independent consulting and I yeah and then then I stopped doing that I got into another job and we can talk about it later but I don't want to steal from your session time but I'm totally open to talk about it um let me see okay I'm in oh you're in okay so I'll pull you to me okay and nice so let's start to unhide this stuff okay you see my screen right let me also share my screen so the recorders can get it yeah yeah I recorders hey robots record this um so here we are right we are in the second second session  is about the crafting phase of the perspective on the first one and thank you for going back into it and I saw that you actually put more stuff around the visual thinking like your own synthesis I it's difficult to say that synthesis I thought you put it there so thank you I went through it and I tried to get like the 10 most relevant things that stood out to me that that we could use as ingredients like they are components of the way you think and the way you you look at this you listen more stuff of course but so we don't get overwhelmed I try to synthesize those into into 10 okay and obviously I want to know if this makes sense to you as the ingredients that I see in your way of working let's have a look and take

13:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  sorry if I'm kind of allergic thing right now okay okay okay so where are you where is that it's the first page it's in the first yeah what do you mean by balance between clinical and spiritual I think the way I see it you the way position yourself is that you have this clinical rigor approach but you also don't get you know stuck in it and you also have this spiritual I don't have spiritual is the best word that you also have this moralistic view but you're also not limited by it so you're you strike me as really like mixing both of these worlds and this seems to be like special to you to your approach yes well yes I think I get from the clinic of the the methodology their rigorosity you know the huh the structure the extra  structural thing, you know, like it's not informal, it makes it professional, know, like having protocols and things like that.  And the spiritual side is, you know, having these values of empathy, compassion, wisdom, you know, aiming to get into the awareness kind of bite, you know, without being to Pachamama or Planet Earth or, know, like, just, you know, I get the best of both words and I want to be in the middle, know, like, my really, and I was, like, getting my hands on again as I did that individual experience this past weekend.  What I noticed is my work, it's actually about the emotional side of things, you know, like, they can go away to the space in their inner world and they can have very spiritual experience or they can want to heal, like, the pressure on a clinical thing or like a  there's some people that oh their shoulder didn't hurt anymore you know like sometimes medical but the aims it's also navigating emotions and perceptions so I think that then the in between it could be therapeutic but I don't want to call it therapeutic you know because I don't want to be it's not a therapy framework it's it also gets the therapy energy but it's I just want to say professional safe space to work emotions so yes I like that supportive structure yes because it's a lot of I would say guidance support and structure you know because guidance is the one that it's guiding support it's you know like they know you're there and sure it's the whole container qualification and filtering participants yes of course it's important to not just for me but for them to guarantee a well done journey  and a safe journey. Also very collaborative because we need to co-create a trust communication, trustworthy communication, trustworthy connection. Human-centric, yes, absolutely.  It's working with emotions, working with suffering. You need to be really human. Yes, we want to empower. We want to become protagonists.  It engages all senses, but it's also like a hard work. What I mean, hard work, it's not the hard work.  You need to do lots of work. It's about the heart, the warmth of your soul. So I don't want to tell people it's about kindness or about the heart or the soul because the professional people don't like those kind of vocabularies.  So I want to see how we can get into it. I like that actually oriented, of course, outcome base integrated experience design.  Yes, I actually think that would be a nice product, you know, like, like, like integration experience design should be like, I need to know how to develop that into a product and a structure approach.  Again, yes, you know, like very methodology, methodology. Cool. Thank you for helping me validate this.

17:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we will move into the first exercise for today. All the stuff that you read above me was is here, right?

17:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  These are the same things.

17:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. And now this, this exercise, this challenge is a little bit more free form. And I think we'll need to be, it's my responsibility as a facilitator, really mindful of exploring,  not going too much into the deep end of things okay so basically there's these four lenses that we can look at things almost anything can be looked at from the these four perspectives the what the how who the why almost everything can we can look in that in that way what I'd like to to do is like from these ingredients that they build up your own perspective I'd like to separate and they can be in more than one place at the same time but it is best if you can not just repeat all of them for every quadrant but I'd like to see which fit better to which perspective okay so we can you do an example and then I go for it perfect perfect so when I when I look at the how  The one that most seems to fit into the how is a structured approach. This to me, clicks really well here.  It also clicks to the what, but I think it's really strong here. And I'm copying them as you see so we can always reuse them.  The support and structure, we can also use it on the how. And you can also explore that idea from the perspective of the why.

19:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Why is it support and structure important to you?

19:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And from our conversations, I have an idea why it is important to you. But so is the exercise making sense?  Do you want us to do another?

19:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We'll do this together.

19:47 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  won't just please you into the house.

19:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, but I just need to put the things inside the box or I need to write something else. No, just let's just.

20:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  First, bring them into the boxes, so we separate how each perspective fits with each thing. So we just copy them.  You can press Alt or you tell me what to do and I can manipulate the mirror for you if you want.  Do you like to work with music?

20:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Okay.

20:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's use a little bit of Miro music. Is there Miro music?

20:29 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Can you hear it?

20:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. How did you play it? So there's a timer function and you can put a song inside of Miro, there's like eight songs and you can put a song into the timer.  There's like eight songs and relaxing songs.

21:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm not missing one. You Yeah. Okay.

21:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does any of. Any of them stood out to you, you wanted, I'll turn off the song now, does any of them, you know, made you think more, made you pay more attention, struck out to you?

22:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I love integrated experience design, and also I should orient it. And And not alone, there are going to be supporter contained inside of the structure, you know, like a proven method that is being tried over.  You know, because at the end, yes, I like to be human centric and everything, but at the end, I'm the one creating the technology.  It's based on them, but what's important is that what I'm offering, it's something already made for them. I think just those three in the aim of, well, in the aim of this, I don't know how many I want, I have to pick, but I think those three are enough.  This is not so much a filtering exercise, you're not limited at this point.

23:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This is more, what you told me is relevant, it's important, so thank you. This is more about provoking this question, like, from which perspective does it make the most sense to you to look at this stuff?

23:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So this is all good. If you want to select more, if you want more, we have that time. Okay.  Thank I think I'm good with those.

24:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  we leave this here for a little while and now we visualize this stuff, okay? And let me bring it to me, bring everyone to me, okay?  So from our conversations and the transcripts and all that I could gather from what you told me and what I've saw on your website and your materials, these are six things.  You've mentioned more during our conversations, but these are six things that from the perspective of product development, like the reasons for you to want to develop this, is what you want to work together.  These six things, they stood out to me. seem to make more sense to me, but I got some empty so we can add more if you want to, but anyway do you want me to go through them and explain my rationale why I picked this or do you want to correct me or adjust something?  I can add something in maybe.

25:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  okay. Does make to you? Well these two are related to it or This one having I think that for now, yes, those.

26:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I noticed that you put these in bold.

26:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you want me to make it look different?

26:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Okay.

26:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfect.

26:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the idea now is that we use that sort of dispersion visual to place this stuff across these two axes, right?  And we're talking about urgent from the perspective of your business and impactful as well. So if there's one that is really clear to you, pick it and place it on the chart, please.

26:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank I'm just filling out the some, of course. Okay. Okay. That does go up market means reach clients that can pay more money.

28:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

28:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Should I put everything or just the ones that I think are the ones that I think are best? It can start with the ones that you think are best, ones that are more outliers, either like really not important or super important.  And if that's enough, because this is a filtering exercise.

28:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now this exercise is a filtering one. based on the things that are the most impactful and the most.

29:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We will choose what to work on. I'm doing. Here is the like the most impactful and most correct.

29:22 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yes, nice one.

30:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah. Oh Oh You

31:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What would you say that's the difference between this one and this one? The top two?

31:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Between which one and which one is it because I don't see your script? No, it's okay.

31:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The two at the top right. So process method and frameworks and having products ready. What do you think is the biggest difference between those two?

31:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You know like I think process method of frameworks is I In a way, like the psychedelic process, I have it, right, but And by methodology, it's also, you know, like having the guidance or I think I have that in a way Maybe I'm confused and it's the framers.  It's like, what are we doing here? What I think I think it's this one the one, you know, like if I With with my process don't like maybe I just need to, you know, but how can this I can Rated in the products, you know, like how can I maybe Define what products I'm going to have, you know, so I can just Bring in the sales people so they can sell something, you know, because right now I have their their Retreats, right?  But I don't want to push that anymore. I want to push the digital side. So for the digital side, I need to have that Like the She probably because maybe it's not the project  because it's actually the material, the content, the structure of the workshop or, you know, but the project could be, you know, like become a coach or leadership in psychedelic transformation and like six weeks to integrate psychedelics in your life or maybe a project could be, you know, I have maybe the products, I have some ideas, but yes, what I mean with the products is, you know, having the things, know, like maybe like online integration community, you know, but I don't have that really because I think, I don't know which one is first, if the process, the method, the frameworks or developing the architecture of the product and then branding.  you know, I have so many things I need to know what to do and I don't know which one is the most important.

33:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, but I I think it makes sense because these things are iterative right you work on something you learn something and you keep redoing ever really finished on one thing and then you move to the next one is like a spiral right so that's a common thing I think perhaps a word that will help you is thinking in terms of offer when you think about product it's it's it's more defined but you offer it as the product and as like the go to market strategy and the offer includes the pricing aspects of it offer is a broader and at the same time more market oriented idea I'm not disagreeing with the word of user of the word product I think it could be useful for you when you do like your own searches online offer could be a valuable concept for you to search but we'll do this together so it's fine okie dokie perfect so when I look at this  Obviously, these two things are most important, and you also, you know, when I see the learning experience integration workshop, to me, it takes more of a process.  So sorry, I'm experimenting with my new Apple pencil, and apparently it was a bit late. When I look at the learning experience, I look at it into a more process-oriented view.  When I look at being an expert and the team, I also look at it from a SOP, kind of standard operating procedure sort of aspect.  And the clarity on the user journey, I think, also relates to this. So on the top right, it feels to me that we're talking about strategy.  Like what to do first, which is something that you've mentioned before. And here I feel it is more about operations.

36:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And here I feel it's more about.

36:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not even process, I don't want to leave real value.

36:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How do you deliver value right.

36:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Does this interpretation make sense to you agree with this.

36:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

36:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now we will do. We'll start to connect these things. So we will get this from two main points of view.

36:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

36:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's one point of view that is more sequence based or process oriented. And there's another one that is more about.  relationships, which is more like a system view. So it's kind of another layer of the what, how, why, and how disappeared.  I just forgot who, what, how, why. So this is another layer of that. So when you think about process view sequence, my suggestion to you is that we start by this one, the learning experience integration.  Okay.

37:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. So I'll bring it here.

37:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'll ask you, let's, let's create the vanilla version of this. As we work together, it will get a little bit more structured or unique.

37:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But if you could describe your process as it is, right now what stages are there i know i've read the stuff but it's important that we do this together okay what's what's the process in integration yeah if we lose yeah yes correct what i told you the integration it's it's you know when we we talk about integration we're talking about learning you know so the whole project it's a transformation but at the at the end it's an of a new awareness yes so starting with that it's the same process as a catholic experience process you know so it's evaluation preparation  integration, prep, exploration, integration, follow up, in another way it could be let me see, let me see I'm thinking, I'm thinking okay it's because this could be also the lever in three, choose, worship and it could be prep could be explore  int to ratio, you know, and with what, with that I mean, this power, or anchor. a lag potential to pay, a lag potential just, for some people it's not paying for that.  connect with ideas of our soul. So, in a way, if I simplify it's cover, cover, on the tags, create, or as well, if you discover, you learn because for all the people that come to experience is because they want to, in a way, they are learning something.  That's why they're changing their perspective. Actually, they are discovering a new way to see, a new perspective in life.  So, in a way, it's a must that they learn something out of this new perspective that provides a psychedelic state.  So, with that, they're going to see maybe their pain or their hidden potential. Okay, I have potential. So, then the growth.  So, learn, grow, and I say build after grow because it's about or maybe when you grow it's because you actually learn, you know, learn it's changing in a way.  So if I grow, now I know I'm responsible to build because I like the word create but build it's actually it's more powerful in a way that you actually need to build things, know.  Create it's more after, you know, how I want to create the best life or build is how do you build the best life, you know, this more action-oriented.  Yes, so this could be like a workshop where, you know, like let's, let's design your integration, you know, so it's integration design in a way so they first need  to learn what are they needing to integrate in they need to integrate some uh hidden pay or they want lights maybe it's also like in a way it's an audit so in a way this one it's about awareness awareness means growth as i've heard you said you cannot uh give birth to an awareness without pain so they need to go for that and how to or in a way also we could say we can we want to map map my new life do you think map comes before because what was thinking what was coming to me as you were explaining this was that if we could find

44:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  a theme that connects everything, right? So anchor is a really good word. I like it, but I was thinking of other because anchor is about sailing, right?

44:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ships and stuff like that.

44:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I was thinking like, can we find words or verbs or actions that they're all part of the same thing?

44:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I was thinking about construction, building stuff like that, right?

44:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And then map to me was like the second one because first you look at the terrain, you observe, oh, there's a rock here.

44:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's a whole, there's some resources I can use some minerals, some diamonds, you know? And you do that on the first one, the audit.  Correct me, please, because I'm, it's just co-creating with you.

44:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So and on the second stage is that's based on that understanding that we got from the scenario. We now see what are the possible ways, the possible paths we can take.  And based on that, we need to make decisions and put in the effort to create those paths, right? Sometimes it will mean dig a tunnel through a mountain, sometimes it will mean create a bridge over a canyon.

45:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  How do you feel about this? Yes, I think we need like a visual metaphor. I'm also between, you see, mountains and, you know, summits and, you know, like, kind of middle stops, or maybe it could be like a vehicle or maybe like a space, you know, like going to like a Mars or something like that.  I'm between, you know, finding out which theme will be the best. You said something about...

45:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Say again, please.

45:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Mars or like space, travels, summits, I have my notion. I have some notes. You said something about the car, right?  Yeah, like, yes. But I don't know if it's a race, no. Sorry for that. OK, so I have your summit.  Base camps or summits, destiny or bridges, like bridge or the faces and conquer, and conquer like a war. You know, I'm getting through raids.  Just padways, like pads, getting into something high. like when you win the trophy, know, could be the sprints and the stops.

47:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But okay, thematically, there's all of them deal with movement, right?

47:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  There's something that all the things you've mentioned have something to do with movement.

47:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You start somewhere and can we can we put this stuff like in a standby? We don't forget it. But put the theme layer at the end.  So we just design the process as it is. And then we think about like the best analogies and the best images.  I know that I pulled you into the direction. I know that I'm just thinking like if we get that foundation and then we put the layer on top.  Based on your market, on the people that you serve, do you notice any, like, themes that are stronger to them?

48:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm just finishing this. I have lots of people from the technology side, entrepreneurs that really just don't have time, they want things fast.  There's a lot of people they just want to heal. I don't know how I'm going to know what they prefer, people, that's an interesting question because I've never seen people really want to, like, I don't know.  If I think... about me I love the space or the mountain or the war thing but if we have a lot of entrepreneurs we want to have this kind of mastery I think inside of them you know like they want to to grow to expand you know like something that it means it's about the greatness I'm asking this because at the end the framework is a communication device for your audience right yes like a bad example let's say that you are your market everybody in your market is a vegan and if you use an analogy that is related to you know cows and raising cattle to sell and that would be a bad example right so they actually you know in a way people came come here because they want more creativity  if they want to unlock potential they want to you know like aim for freedom all of them want freedom maybe it's people from corporate maybe it's central north but they just want freedom so freedom means i really let's see how what what you know like maybe the space it means going beyond the ordinary going beyond life you know and maybe war it's not an option maybe car i don't know what i think like they want a space you know i had this client this weekend and he was talking like he wants to space space space that they were talking so what's the impact of that you know like what does that mean you so we started looking at interpretation it means you know trying to go beyond the ordinary trying to connect with something beyond you know and what's beyond or maybe inside like either beyond it's our greatness or true potential you know but you need to go outside of your thinking might outside of your comfort zone so it means  It's getting outside of my mind, getting outside of my own perspective, so what gets me outside of Earth, the space, know, the spaceship, you know, in a way, I'm not, I'm not getting people like, are really to Patamama or planet Earth or spiritual, you know, like, that's why maybe summit would be nice for people that are really attached to the, to this and, you know, people love this, but they're also like, are, like, meta aware, you know, like, are conscious of, they, they, you know, like, we need to connect with those people that, you know, it's, I think a spaceship sounds good, you know, because it's escaping the matrix, escaping something, it's escaping the simulation, in a way, without using those words, you know, without being too conspiratorial or conspiracy.  Oh, I love that word, conspiratorial, that's really good. And and and also, you know, I was thinking also like like airline or or flight But I don't know at the end.  It's you you are still inside, you know, people want to go to Mars, you know Okay, when you talk about space you're talking about extra vehicle activities like get out of the spaceship Yes.  Yes also, you know, it's not just okay If I'm landing that we can do that if I'm landing on Mars What's the first thing you need to do if you're landing into a new awareness?  What's the first thing you need to do, you know, like and that's how we are like we can do the illustration branding game With those kind of things, you know, like watch your jets jets jet What you call get happy, you know, like where are you?  Where are you taking with you from earth? What are you taking? Where are you taking from your own life that it's really valuable, you know Like you cannot let it go, but you can take one thing.  What would it be, you know now? Like what's that seed that you can plant in Mars, you know So, I think it will be very interesting, you know, because I also want to make it fun, you know, it should be fun, you know, like, it's not just, it's not psychedelic healing in a way.  It's growing, you know, like, you don't go to Mars to heal, like you have to get out of Earth, you know, you go to Mars because you want to grow in Mars.  You get me?

53:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's not a defensive, it's not playing defense, it's playing offense. Like, I want more, I'm not trying to protect from getting less, it's like, give me more stuff, right?

53:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And that's how we are going to aim to get to those people that we are more proactive, that they really want to see how this can take them beyond their wildest dream, you know, like, you know, I'm not an expert in business advice, they're really, like, really successful people, you know.  I with a guy that he has a logistic company. He's selling 25 millions of dollars per year. So why is he with me, you know?  Because he wanted, he's worries, I've done lots of terpies, but I'm here, you know, just to discover new facet of me, a new part of me that I never been able to see.  And I found intuition to be here, you know? So the people that I work with were like very elite, know, like entrepreneurs that are, you know, they have really, really millions, millions of money, you know?  So like, why are you taking these sessions with me when they can be with whatever? Because I already, I show them that I'm professional, I show them that I really care and I, and they like my energy.  There's something in my energy that they like. So I don't know, I just wanted to say that as well.  if we can get something out of that. they like that I don't talk about, oh, spirituality, things like that.  It's because one of the wives told me, oh, do you believe in manifestation and all of those things? And I'm like, if you're ready, like you, we were already talking, you notice that I never say things about the spiritual side, you know, we talk about maybe the heart or the things that it's about having confidence in you.  It doesn't matter what happens, you know, you need to know your essence. So I just use the word spirit or things like that.  They have their own way of thinking, but they connect with me because I speak, you know, like if there's a lot of different kind of Spanish all around the world, I speak the neutral Spanish, you know, like where they can get me everywhere, you know, Latin in a way, you know, so that that happens at the level of our words that I can speak with people we like normal.  language I don't know no I think I understand I think I understand your point and that's like the fact that you made it made a distinction between heart and emotion and spiritual because sometimes I could be looking at that from the same thing but it's not the same thing and you this is important to you so thank you thank you for bringing that no and then sorry sorry just and I think there's something about I can push also like a narrative in my communication about you know the work working the heart we're at I mean after a period approach or a spiritual approach you know like working the heart it's working the emotions you know it's the dimension that it it's the one that it dominates your life you know in a way because if people are like stuck or if people are passionate it's because of emotion you know they know they know how to serve their emotion they they know how to create their own emotions  Okay, so yes, so far so that's why my my aim is also around emotional sign So that's that's why people I think they get a lot from the experience because if it's a spiritual It's infinite, you know, like we could talk about the mages or the Babylonian or a lot of things But you know, like that doesn't mean a changing, you know Yeah, there's any layers to this like you can explore like yourself you can be a Like an astronaut you can be a Heart not I mean this I don't love this name, but you get the point the idea of It's a different environment.

57:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It requires special skills What works down here doesn't work up there and vice versa and it's an exciting journey So when you're telling me the stuff That the image that was coming to me was the difference between two different

58:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  of space movies, right? One space movie that I was thinking was very kind of rigorous and Apollo 13, for instance, right?

58:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the other is 2001 Space Odyssey, which is almost a sensorial experience. The movie, it's not about the narrative, it's about something else, right?  It's about feeling the movie. So when you're talking about space, to me, these are the two poles, extremes of this, right?

58:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Apollo 13, which is like an engineer's movie, and 2001 Space Odyssey, it's like a poet's movie, right?

58:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's what made me think.

58:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes, yes, yes. And I'm also thinking lots of people when they get out of this building for me, this was like interest to me.  The part of the poor dimension, I felt I was there.

58:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So

59:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So that means something I just noticed that and also, you know, like have you watched the lucky, know a TV show?  And they didn't I'm like yes now you get me, you know So lucky it's a TV show that it's called about the time variances, you know Like they get into the time travel thing.  So I think the time travel theme It's gonna be nice because there's a TV show that I also love in Apple TV that it's called dark matter that it's about time traveling to Quantum space through a psychedelic substance that they inject and with the mind you need to meditate away So you can project the life that you want.  So maybe that could be a nice one, know, like Have like time traveling in a way, you know, but I'm traveling to a new world time and traveling to your past I'm traveling to the future self.  So maybe it's like, oh, it's it's at the end if maybe we want to The innovation comes actually not in the actual experience in the never thought experience  I think that will be very, because also I was thinking, know, like, what is, what is the thing that it's moving the needle for people to take the experience, and it's about igniting the curiosity, you know, and what if I'm pushing, know, imagine that you can time travel to different parts of your life.  Wow, that's amazing.

1:00:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think all of them are really strong, but if you mix them up, I think we might suffer in getting people to understand them.  How do you feel about this?

1:00:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, you're the master, you know, like, I'm just throwing my ideas, you know. Yeah. I like these ideas as well.

1:00:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I like this kind of stuff. I love time traveling movies. I love Christopher Nolan.

1:00:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I really like that stuff.

1:00:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And an interstellar is a good mix of both themes, right? But interstellar is also a famously difficult to understand movie, right?  So I'm thinking.

1:01:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  like the framework as a tool to communicate to people the first the first level of the the framework should be really clear and maybe as people get through your process and they work with you you can add complexity like oh by the way do you know that when you travel close to the sun gravity is different time is different that's really strong but if you start there it's uh it could be scary for some people that don't feel very smart about these things uh because there's there was another guy like and I have this fresh you know like interaction with people and he just right wrapped his watch and he was like there's no time there's no space you know like but this this this brings me back to earth to this plane we are here right here are but you know I'm outside you know I'm everywhere you know like so there's  something between time-space trouble, you know what? So have you watched it?

1:02:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have not.

1:02:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, just the first one.

1:02:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just the first one.

1:02:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's also the guy that invented that movie. It's called, don't know, Frank Herbert. And he thought Paul Staben, the one that has a documentary that is called Fantastic Pongai, he thought him how to grow psilocybin better.  So the spice, it's actually psilocybin. Control the spice, control minds, and control space travel. know, so. Oh, yeah, yeah, I got it.

1:02:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I see the connection.

1:02:39 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK, yeah, now go ahead, No, no, the time and space.

1:02:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  mean, this is their intertwine. makes all the sense. So let me just try to see the dice. Yes, yes.  So we have this system right now. And one of the things I've found, not just through working with you, but also other people.  is that sometimes you get really excited about the narrative layer and we invent names first for different stages because these names they they are brandable and they're exciting but sometimes people like the customers they get lost in these names because they they're like okay I see that everything is about space but I don't know what exactly happens at this stage so so people need to have a certain understanding of what happens at that stage besides what are the results of those yes yes so so my suggestion for us now is okay I think we are pretty convinced that space is a good world building exercise right we can build the stuff around space so let's just talk about the process then and I'll just take this stuff and bring it to the side so we have more

1:04:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, okay, more more space.

1:04:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Um, we're in the same page developer, right? Yeah, we are in the blue one.

1:04:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Correct. Yeah, perfect.

1:04:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I'll bring this four things. I want to play some music on my own.

1:04:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you like roof of the soul?

1:04:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, the what? Do you like you can play it? Yeah, I'm gonna play it the worst.

1:04:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, I don't I'll learn. I'll learn if I don't know.

1:04:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we have the preparation. All right, using the boring English version. Exploration. And the integration. Okay, cool. And these stages have inner stages.  Correct. Like they have inner phases inside of them. I'll give a different color to each one, just so we know that there are different things.

1:05:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Now you want to know what happens in each stage, right? Yes, yes.

1:05:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So inside the preparation, what happens inside the preparation?

1:05:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you think we should stay just with three because, you know, first is the evaluation, but maybe that's not part of the process, or is it part of the process?

1:05:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think evaluation is a big part of the process also because it's the first experience they have working with you.  So we should have evaluation.

1:05:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So maybe it's our first step in process, right? Mm-hmm. I want to keep it as simple as possible you know like people feel like okay so in a way like I'm paying for this simplicity but at the end where we want to get out of the chaos or the complexity of things you know they already have so many complex things in their complex lives so it needs to feel so simple for them to do it you know.  Absolutely and I think for people like you and I we are excited by exploring the different layers and the different complexities of things yeah okay I'm going to start filling up so we can go ahead evaluation it's to pre-qualify.  How do you say, let me see.

1:07:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Don't worry about the arrows right now, because they sometimes they get a little bit confused when we resize them.  Profiling.

1:07:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Profiling. Is it a, also, know, like that's the first screen in a, actually, in a profiling. You know, first you need to like question about, are you pregnant or do you, or do you have a family with someone with a schizophrenic or psychosis?  Have you, do you have like a super system at home, etc. Then, okay, profiling would be nice. And with profiling means, you know, like, kind of the needs, the motives that you are here.  The. You know, I have, I said three kind of layers of persona and I'm actually, let me see, I have my table here.  So I have, in a way, it's the mode in profiling, it's the motive, like why are you here? That could be, I have a type form, but I don't know, maybe we can simplify that, but people come because they're stuck, they're blocked, they're born out, they're in transition, maybe from a career, from a new entrepreneurship thing, or maybe they are being, they have a broken relationship with something, or they have a family member, or they're moving to a new city, or they just want well-being and peace, or maybe they just want new tools or intuition.  That's, a lot of people say, I, there's an intuition that I needed to be here. know, I'm like, I want to know, like what,  If there's an intuition for it, I just knew that I had to be heard. I have lots of people that I found your energy.  Why felt that it was this time? know, in a way, it's a motive, the expectation of the of the world.  know, like they maybe they want to grow spiritually. They want to reduce stress. They want to heal things. They want to find purpose.  But at the end, I in the profiling thing, I put three kind of people. It's the do you say buscador in English by the searcher?  searcher, he's seeking in a way answers or healing or consciousness. He's seeking his himself in a way, the seeker.  I think it's the seeker. Then I have the explorer, the explorer of purpose or of maybe. How do you say out of steam?  Self esteem, self steam. Yes, like the explorer of maybe something. in greater insight of themselves because that's what purpose gives people, you know, like a sense of this is worthy, you know, like I'm worthy, you know, so the story of sense-making in a way, the purpose of sense-making or self-esteem and I have in the end the leader, you know, the burnout leader that he wants to go for renovation or, you know, the clarity or vitality, know, but it's the warrior that it's already like he needs a space where he can rest, you know, so in a way it's the searcher like looking for things kind of, it's the same as the explorer, but the explorer wants to go beyond.  The searcher, he's looking for something specific, the explorer, he's exploring something and the burnout leader, it's the one that he needs help, know, he's screaming for help, so I have this, I just did that today.  all right the three things that I think it's the people that if I have me if I if I can profile them in three things that that will be okay now next okay excellent that you're writing profiling and the third thing in the evaluation could be so in my process I do maybe in the evaluation what else could it be so it's this is the one to say you can come in you cannot come in you know like when you go to a roller coaster it's it do you are you the size no you're not the size okay if you decide now make the line profiling okay and maybe in the evaluation is assigning signing a couch or a psychologist in our  Because if I want to be an entrepreneur, I need to hire coaches and psychologists. in a way, it's assigning a champion in a way, someone, you know, it's, it's he's going to go with you throughout the process.  Preparation, it's sorry, can we go back here?

1:12:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So this is somebody from your team that changed champion.

1:12:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, that will be a coach or a psychologist, depending on the profile.

1:12:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:12:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe I have a coach for here. So, you know, this is will be different users in a way.

1:12:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

1:12:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In the preparation, maybe it's actually the first onboarding materials. Maybe access what do you need the materials or the process?

1:13:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I heard your question, but I'm not sure I understand any rephrase, please. Yes, in the preparation.

1:13:16 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you want me to tell you like what it's what I want to do in terms of operations or what I what I want them to do to achieve something so they can get to the other stage.

1:13:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's start with what you want them to achieve and then we go into operations. Again.

1:13:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And then we go into operations. That's it. FACE 7X FACTS FACTS Nations Recommendations Recommendations Saves the very efficient list FACTS on the of it Analyze the FACTS FACTS on the side of it Analyze the  maybe actually the coverage is very much less burdens and content is excellent . . . . . . .  . . . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank

1:17:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But can you tell me a little bit more about the specific steps, like for instance, when you talk about explore with compassion, what things do you do that lead people to explore with compassion?

1:17:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I see your emotion as kids. Imagine this is your house, your family. So if fear comes up or sadness comes up, imagine it's you, or imagine it's your son.  How would you approach fear? Would you close the door and get to your room? Or would you become paranoid, psychotic like he is?  You're grown up. You need to show him. you're something like you can handle the situation and you're compassionate enough to get closer to him and try to understand him you know so you know wait and when I say curiosity it's not detrimental because you want to you don't want to judge while you're exploring you know I always say that example like if you're a scientist or you know like a programmer or a biologist you have a tool that it's called a microscope at the telescope so when you're looking for things you want to learn the behavior so there's okay so maybe here it's intention setting maybe a key vision versus intention when I say ambition it's like what are the like the actual result just for that's the first intention the first intention is your first journey you know in the first journey maybe you're not going to learn everything about China you're going to maybe the first city or the tourist place  in China. You're not going to see the best of best. So the mission maybe is learning more about the work, but the first intention is, you know, I want to travel to Mexico to know Mexico first.  Yeah. So in a way, when we go to the exploration phase, it's about, okay, remember the intention, remember that if you're a biologist or astronomer, when you look up to the window, you want to set yourself for the intention.  And if the intention is to learn about a behavior or something that's, that it's doing the mic, the micro or the star system.  So what you want to do is to see, observe, and use the scientific approach, you know, you're not going to interpret the situation or going to analyze or rationalize what you see.  It's about just observing.

1:19:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That is clear to me. it seems to me. Maybe I don't get it.

1:19:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. Tell me what is this, what is it that you want?

1:19:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What is like So let's pretend that I am one of your clients and I am at this stage, right?

1:20:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

  And the outcome that you, the behavior you want me to have is to not judge my emotion, just observe them, treat them with kindness and openness, right?  There's something you say or there's something you do or there's something you ask me to do that puts me into this place, right?  It could be just telling me, explore with curiosity, maybe that's it, or it could be something more complex or with more steps or the specific instruction that you give me, I think that's the question I have, specific instruction.

1:20:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, you know, in a way you need, there's three articles you need to You need to have trust let go and be open, you know while you are being open To handle fear to navigate emotions or difficult emotions.  You could do zoom in and Smell that is you can be in the motion or you can be the awareness That's is the emotion and when I say explore with curiosity is that if you judge the experience You're going to feel more fear if you're into a very kind of scene or moment So you want to see like where does this come from?  know you want to be curious so you can handle the situation in a more proactive approach And you want to also empower yourself So that's why you are looking into emotions as a geologist That it's looking into a rock because you're judging the road you're seeing like wow.  Wow. This is wonderful It's really weird, but there's something in it that I really want to relate how how did this this this rock came To be like this, know, there's there's there's  they want to learn you know and also there's I apply also a recommendation of also be compassion maybe just curiosity is enough but compassion it's you know I want to get closer I want to understand it's just not about uh learning it's about understanding so compassion comes up and then you want to explore for wisdom because there's a teaching in that thing that you're exploring with curiosity so also you want to just not explore exploration you want to explore for wisdom because the wisdom there's the perspective that you want to change okay I still don't get it no I get it but there's I mean I see the connection and all of them seem very logical what I'm struggling with is um when during the actual experience the experience it's you know like the instruction is you know not during the experience it's before  And you put the glasses and you're just laying down in the experience. like you're getting into virtual reality for four or five hours.  So I don't I also another instruction is that I don't get involved in what you do. You know, I'm going to be here like holding the space for you and you're going to fill my presence.  If you need help, you just like raise your head and I'm going to be there. So people, they just they just like down in the experience.  They're in the movie, you know, I cannot interfere because that will be, you know, like getting into their experience.  It's not my job to get into their experience, unless they're not handling the motion. Jorge, can you come here?  You know, I'm feeling this. Yes, of course. Remember that I told you that you need to look at your emotions with curiosity.  Like no, but I feel so anxious. Yes, it's okay. I'm here with you. You don't have to feel anxious alone.  Let's explore the emotion. Where do you feel it in your body? So it's not about the exploration. It's them to explore.  That's it. Okay, that's for sure. very relevant because in that case I am assuming now leave it a little bit away so I am assuming that the zoom in zoom out happens at the end of the exploration workshop is that correct no during the exploration I give it that instruction but they have the opportunity to okay remember that also you can zoom in and zoom out you know you can get into the ocean of the or you can go above the ocean you know and people talk like oh and that was really really practical and really really helpful because I was getting into my childhood experience and I think it was too much I just remember I can zoom out and I did zoom out you know and I can I saw my myself differently you know it helped me because I was getting overwhelmed so I'm that the like where airplanes are landed I'm the tower of control you know like  Yes, come on you're going to go like this is like I'm just here for them to take off and to land So you you don't like during the flight you are present Yes there You will not begin any action.

1:25:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You will just wait for them to say Jorge I need help with this and then you you get into action, right?  You do like the like the air traffic control tower you'd say, okay, so Come back to two thousand feet Slow your speed like but during the flight they are it's like it's like a A flight instructor right when you're taking flight lessons you sit in the airplane You are next to guy, but you're not in not manipulate the airplane But if they say okay, so in that case if I understood it correctly in that case what I am assuming is In the exploration workshop, there's a phase of the  workshop where you give all of these instructions before the experience begins correct yes okay so and then the experience begins they enter into the experience I am assuming that like you guide them in the takeoff right so they take something you tell them how do you feel lay down this way experiment with breathing this way and slowly correct me if I'm wrong but slowly you start participating less and less and less and that's a point you you're not holding any controls and they're flying they're the pilots they're pilots remember they're the protagonists of your life so they're the pilots I'm just they're like for the takeoff and if they need me I'm a standby but I I know that there's someone there if they need help okay so and so the zoom in is it's all of these things are in the same column right which is the column of flight

1:27:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Instructions,-flight check.

1:27:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, pre-flight check and let's just put your seatbelt.

1:27:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Remember.

1:27:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we have that and then we have the Okay, so the experience Or maybe I can do like a checkup like like in an hour.

1:27:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's like hey, how are you? Uh-huh. are you feeling? I think I think I'm in the experience. Okay. Thank you.

1:27:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just letting you know that I'm going to be around if you need me, you know, okay, check it up Okay, as you know Check up Okay, I was insisting insisting on this because from the perspective of uh of an outsider Um, I wasn't I wasn't sure of what was happening at each stage So I needed to be a little bit annoying at this day at this moment, but thank you for your patience Um

1:28:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, thank you for, thank you, because sometimes I don't get it, but thank you for being patient with me.  Wow, I imagine.

1:28:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so then they go through the experience and we are assuming that so occasional checkup and if something happens and if they need help, you can...

1:28:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have also, you know, like emergency phone number just in case, you know, I never use it or...

1:28:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Emergency piloting, I don't know, something like this. Okay, and towards, so this has a certain duration I assume, there's a few hours I suppose, and towards the end, when people come out of it, do they come out?

1:28:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like, imagine it's, you know, take off, going off, peak experience, that's what I explain in the actual preparation, you know.  Like there's takeoff, going up, peak, going down, and landing, you know, so. So takeoff, peak, is that what he said?

1:29:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, no, going up.

1:29:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. Then there's the peak.

1:29:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Going down and landing.

1:29:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's the exact, yes. Okay.

1:29:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, come this way. And landing. After the landing, do you also do kind of a check systems? So, because I assume that when people land, it's not like, oh, ciao.  See you later. You probably have some sort of.

1:29:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I also, I really want to do like a lot of, in landing, if you. in a group you know I'm thinking this could be done in an actually virtual experience in a way because I've already done that with 27 people like two weeks ago and they really like that but I think there was no one with them it was them alone but I prepared them like maybe two months before for the experience but in landing we could see that it's actually the integration no but it's because you know I've been seeing that actually in the landing like maybe I always give the integration instructions later but I think maybe before like how did how are they going to prepare for the landing you know because when they're landing they need to know what to do so maybe in the verification maybe that should be in the preparation worship as well very for uh landing verification like landing verification list you know  So why do I recommend them in the landing? It's take their time, don't call anyone, don't drive. Those kind of instructions, you know?  in the landing, it's actually, when I'm in presence, right now in the city that I want to, it's, you know, I put a song with lyrics, so they know they're waiting on them.  you know, when you're ready, you can lift your eyesheds slowly and open your eyes. So they open slowly, they see me.  Wow, Jorge, this was the most profound experience. Wow, there was so many things. I saw my mom, I saw this, I saw, so I just give them a space to talk.  the landing is about when you land into a new city. The thing is that when you land, don't talk to anyone.  you would like to tell someone the way we're landing into a new place or we saw so many things where we were in the time traveling machine.  maybe it's I call in the landing a small like a number of talk integration, conversation of integration.

1:32:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I also have quite but I don't know sorry I have so many ideas and I don't know how to say try to try to at this stage focus more on the things you already do because the opportunity to have more ideas is always there right so if we focus on what you have right now is a bit more concrete I think it will be easier even if you have like oh I wish it was different it's okay but just focus on what you do right now.

1:34:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, I think that's it, that's what I do right now.

1:34:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, let me pull the drawings to the side so we don't.

1:35:01 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What actually also in the landing is because sometimes I do it something I know and if it's a retreat it's different than if it's individual so that's why what I if it's a retreat also a community sharing that is an integration circle.  Okay, just right after they left and then we go to eat eat and instructions and let them know you know when we're in the tree just you go to the room if you want to write write like I start writing or start mapping give me instructions to write and let them know I'll be here if they want to talk if even if I see someone that they are not talking to me but I know dirt I said  is that there's something difficult they're going through. do an emotional checkup if they need more support. That's it. Got it.

1:36:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So now, so these are all the steps. So far, we need the steps of the integration workshop as well.

1:36:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I don't know if you have more time. do have more time. Yes, I have like 24 minutes. OK. I'm actually going to do it.  So integration is community sharing. Also, questionnaire, integration, image collage, know, right now I was doing for the group, you know, the day after we connect, like if they experience on Saturday, we connect on a Sunday.  And I did a mural. And I told them, you know. put the images that best describe the experience, you know, so they did a collage, know, and then I actually can show you.  Did I show you last time?

1:37:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry. Is this my wife that arrived?

1:37:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I was hearing something.

1:37:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I don't think you've ever showed me. Can you show me, please? Yes, can I show the screen? Or if you want, just paste it inside of the mirror.  can also do that. Okay.

1:37:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let me do that. I'm going to do a screenshot. Okay. Okay. So big. So I do, for the appropriation, as well, I do like interactive mural workshop, you know, like I could put in interactive mural.  workshop. So they do a collage and then I do like questions to translate visions and emotions into practical insights to as well actionable steps.  The questioner is about the actual experience. From 1 to 10, how would you describe the experience? What else did you learn?  What was our repeated theme that you find out in the experience? How was the experience for you? How was the company and the process for you so far?  end of an NPS, but not an NPS, it's more for me. The interactive real worship, it's about the community sharing.  That's where they go integration. And also the questions, it's right here. And then at the end, when they get the actual steps, it's kind of also the impact effort.  Which one is the one that you really, really, really depends now, know, so do that now in a way.

1:40:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's kind of refreshing.

1:40:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And another, another, another. So is it in this order? No, the NPS is after, you know, like, you know.  And also, maybe, you know, I'm doing those nows, maybe this one here, and I could do like, a somatic integration here, somatic integration.

1:40:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You do somatic integration.

1:41:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And right now, or is a future no, it's I do it right now, you know, that's a mark integration.  It's like, I'm actually going to do on Wednesday that it's two weeks after the experience, know, like integration. It's also like, like kind of not just a neural workshop of two hours.  It's an ongoing process. It's infinite. You know, so there's so many things you can do right now. I do also it's community sharing the interactive neural workshop that they are loving it.  And the somatic integration, you know, like how to balance their inner energies, balance inner energy.

1:41:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the integration image collage and the interactive neural workshop, are they the same thing? Or they're separate, separate things?

1:41:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's in the same thing. Also, like the questions are in the same interactive neural workshop. Like the question, like the collage, and then it's the arrow, we go to the next page.  Now, like, what was your intention again? So from the class, we got the question so it's interactive like maybe it could be like a three-hour worship or more depending on how many people so i'll delete this thing because i put it here okay okay uh okay and he tells us what the community sharing right okay interactive community sharing interactive workshop okay so i'll take this one out i'll bring this one here this this thing is the same as here right which one i don't see you okay so the questions to translate vision and emotions it appears twice i'm assuming that we can just leave that one there yes no yeah because yeah it's everything it's in the worship but this whole thing's all

1:43:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All these things happen during the workshop, right?

1:43:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, yes.

1:43:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But these things, they don't happen in the workshop, these things?

1:43:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  These four things happen in the workshop. These four things, the ones that I'm moving. OK, but these ones don't happen in the workshop.  That's a second, like, no. That's a static integration. It's a second workshop, in a way.

1:43:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. You know, that's a second level integration workshop.

1:43:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. And this one will change the color and make it this color. Maybe that's, maybe instead, like, an integration workshop, it's the second level as well as the follow-up.  OK.

1:43:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK. And the balance in our energies is the somatic integration, right? Yes.

1:44:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so maybe the questioner that I do, I do it right here, but I don't know if it's very, if after different layers of integration, I do the questionnaire of the process.  I don't know which one would be the best, but right now I do it right in the middle. And the community member, could be your moral for lifetime value, like lots of people really want.  I haven't been able to develop the whole ecosystem, but at end people want to keep communicated, know, like people that like they don't want to be alone.  They want to be understood and people that they know that they have trouble. They maybe they ask questions like what documentary do you recommend or what are you doing right now to do this?  So I'm going like that's the ongoing.

1:44:49 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's more than the following.

1:44:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So yes, beautiful.

1:44:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we have this stage, the evaluation that leads to the preparation workshop. That leads to the exploration workshop at the end we have an integration workshop after the integration workshop we have the questionnaire and sometimes I don't think this is all the time we have the follow-up and then after that or after this one as well we have the the community membership.  Is this accurate? And of these things what things like the community membership doesn't exist yet right? Yes. So I'll just mark it.  I'll mark it with a form that is not yet ready, but everything else is something that you do, right?  Yes, so it is good. Okay, so so this is your process for one specific thing, which is the integration workshop, okay?  And based on this, we can now, not in this session, but we can now put a layer, a narrative layer on it, which could be around space, right?  The space thing connects really well with the airline thing, for obvious reasons, so Oh, that would be relatively easy, I think, instead of calling it, it's almost the same thing, right?  Instead of peak, we call it apex, because it's like, how do you call it, an orbit, right?

1:47:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  When you hit the top of the orbit.

1:47:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But anyway, so this is your process right now. And I think there's more stuff for us to do, and I have to have one at least.

1:47:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But I want to know, how useful was it for you to explain this thing to me? It was useful, because I already know the process, but looking at it, it helps me more, like, truly think also about the user journey, and, like, which part of the process needs, like, it's  already like optimized in which it's not and which could be better you know.

1:48:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because right now when you sell this because this is service you already provide right. When you when you're explaining this thing to people is there any specific part where people get more questions?  Like they take more time to understand what you mean.

1:48:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe like what am I going to feel like what am I going to feel what I'm what's going to happen and how do you handle the situation if I get nervous you know but I like I already explained that but maybe people they don't listen but that's that's why I push push a lot the psycho-education you know but I don't want to be too mental but because they already read it they saw the documentary and things they hear me say it but maybe if they ask so many questions because at the end it's they they're nervous it's  Because they didn't listen to me. It's just as the internet was nervous.

1:49:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Maybe it's not a matter of knowledge or information.

1:49:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's just a matter of emotion Yeah So maybe I could be being more trust in the connection with clients You know if that's like if you keep having questions such as because they don't feel like it's so confident like it may be Because they don't know how it's everything going to turn out, know because it's so in a way We want to make this experience predictable.  Yeah, you know, but there's there's also like Certain states of our predictability, you know, it's ambiguous.

1:49:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah now absolutely And I think I can imagine that it's impossible to make it fully predictable. That's part of the wonder of it Yes, so one of the things that I was thinking is Even in the way you talk about this now is  Have you ever been to a course where the teacher says exactly what's going to happen and you think the teacher is exaggerating, but then they get it always?  So I can give you a personal example.

1:50:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I took a course.

1:50:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It lasted for months, for a few months, like eight months. And during the course, sometimes it felt that it was moving very slowly.

1:50:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I was like, , mean, I was like, this is taking too long.

1:50:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I want to learn faster.

1:50:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But the teacher, she had a lot of experience in this course. She had done this course like more than 50 times.

1:50:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  really knew the stages at which people got stuff or problems or questions or doubts.

1:50:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  She was very experienced. And sometimes she would say, look, I'm going to tell you this thing.

1:50:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're going to think this thing. And then you'll think this thing and then eventually you will think this third thing.  And it was really true because she had a lot of experience with this, right? And the point was she was not trying to get us to not have those questions.  She knew that we needed to go through those questions.

1:51:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So she just kind of made us feel that you will have questions.

1:51:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's normal. It's not a problem.

1:51:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And eventually you will solve those questions.

1:51:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The act of her predicting what would be our challenges did not take the challenges away, but made us feel much more confident in her ability to guide us.  So you can just do the same thing, right? You say, look guys, you'll write before the, you take the psilocybin, you'll have, you'll probably ask me about this.  It's okay.

1:51:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'll answer.

1:51:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you're not trying to avoid the question, but you're just trying to. to realize, yeah, the question will always happen.  And by knowing that, I reinforce how much of an expert I am in this thing.

1:52:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Does that make sense to you?

1:52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes, I like that.

1:52:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I never thought about that with. in a way, we could be mapping what questions or what kind of things might happen while they're in the experience.  Or during the experience, you know. You will ask, how would you say like, like mapping questions?

1:52:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mapping the questions and letting people know that they will ask those questions. And that's entirely predictable and OK, and it's no problem.  I can give you another example. I like this example a lot. Sometimes when I finish working with a client, I create that.

1:53:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  bingo cards of the challenges they will face after we work together, okay?

1:53:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I was doing this for somebody that wanted to create some content about their expertise and at the end I made a bingo card about things that would happen to them, right?  For instance, you will write a very good post and then you'll hesitate for a long time for your post.  You will find somebody has something similar to what you believe and you will wonder if it's worth it for you to write the same thing, you know?  Just common patterns, right?

1:53:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And when people found those things, they didn't feel like they were a failure. They just thought, oh, this is normal.  I'm not a loser.

1:53:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm doing a difficult thing and it's okay if I have these difficulties because...

1:54:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  nothing is certain right but because I told them that they would feel that in the bingo card they're like oh he really knows this stuff he really understands like process right so I think there's something in there for you as well like that so I think in a way I put them that I think you have that in at the beginning it's just like a good integration framework you know like the stages of integration you know like you're going to have lots of regulation and cognitive overload that perfect maybe that's the first step that you're going to face and it's okay you know like lots of people maybe eight percent of people face that you know like maybe you're also in the high phase you know like everything it's so beautiful and you'll feel so more many ready to but that takes only two weeks sorry that last maybe  two weeks and you know you will get back to reality. There's theory of the of the rubber that you are going to expand the mentality but if you don't change something you're going to get back to the same personality.  So I have things like that maybe you get into the planning and habit formation what I know for sure that you can do it by yourself but most of the people 90 percent really need the follow-up and the coaching you know because it's not as easy as you think so that's why I also push the coaching system.

1:55:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So no this is perfect because you already have the materials right and if you have the material there's many things you can do with that material like on a very basic level and basic is not bad it's just like the first layer you can just say oh this is what will happen and you put it in a document right uh on a more advanced level  You can say, you can even have stuff like instead of presenting it as a list, you present it as an archetype.  Okay. So for instance, if you are a seeker, the usual questions you have are these questions, you know, so you mix two things, mix the predictability of their experience.  That is predictable to you for them is completely life changing and new, but for you is something that you've seen a few times, so you have that.  And also at the same time you connect with that thing that the person recognizes themselves in your own advice, which is why everybody likes to read the horoscope, right?  You want to see yourself in that description. You can mix these two things. You say, oh, we've made the assessments.

1:56:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  We figure out what's your profile. Your profile usually struggles with these things. And it's really good at dealing with these other things.  That's very useful for people.

1:57:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  OK, OK, OK.

1:57:10 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Profiling the challenges. Come again?

1:57:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Not profiling the challenges.

  Yes, yes.

  And for instance, OK, I think we have, like, just a couple of minutes. But just to give you an example.  Let me make a drawing. Where are we? OK, here. Just a second.

  There's also something that is called, what kind of, sorry, but I need to find it. OK, we have the grand adventurer.  We have the wireless enthusiast, the breakthrough seeker, the spiritual mystic. I got it from, also, another Psychedelic Retreat from London.

1:57:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, OK, OK.

1:57:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool.

1:58:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, for instance, one of the things we could do is you create a visual framework that has some profiles, okay?  So you have this person, you have this person. This is just easy drawings, right? So never mind what they look like, bring everyone to me.  And this person, right?

1:58:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And you have these stages. One, two, three, four, okay?

1:58:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This person is really good at this aspect in this stage. And they struggle with this thing, right? But at this other stage, they're really good at something else.  And they struggle with a different thing.

1:58:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  If you make a...

1:59:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A matrix, a matrix like this, and we can do it together. The person can look at this and say, oh, I am this guy.  I am on this stage, so I am feeling this thing. Oh, it's good. It's all good. know?

1:59:18 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  OK, I like that.

1:59:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And this is a good way of conveying how much you know about this thing. It shows a pattern recognition, which is a usual sign of expertise.  You see patterns that other people can see.

1:59:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I love that, because people can identify themselves with the archetype. Exactly.

1:59:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And you can use your own archetypes. I would suggest you just use what's already in the market or out there, because the more famous an archetype is, the more likely it is that it has been tested and evolved in the right way.

1:59:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Because we could invent something. in the session.

2:00:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But maybe it doesn't make sense in real life. So based on what you observe and like what you see in the literature, you can you can do something here.  Okay, like that. So profile is strong and weakness.

2:00:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay.

2:00:27 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So Jorge, I think we'll have to end this now. Yes. But give me give me a bit of time later and I'll organize what's the best way to move forward.  Perfect.

2:00:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I know I also love the images that you did. So if you can just keep them it's it will be nice and just let's see like let's filter like what it's the best way to move forward, you know.  Okay, okay. We'll do that for sure.
