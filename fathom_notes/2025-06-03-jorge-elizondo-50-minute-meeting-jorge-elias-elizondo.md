0:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  ...office. You're never in the same environment. I'm in Thailand right now.

0:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Really?

0:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No. You see? You see? That's your brand. You said you were in Thailand, and it made sense to me, so that's a good brand.  Yes. Let me pull your note-taker in.

0:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I just opened my Substack, and I saw one of your latest posts, and I wanted to ask you, how long does it take you to write and then do the design?  I see that you put pictures or kind of visual frameworks. How long does it take to just make one post?  Because I know you do a research thing, right?

0:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it depends. But I would say that put the pictures, like the little cartoons. I don't know which post you saw, but the ones that are like little cartoons.  Expertise demo.

0:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Expertise

1:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  They have little cartoons. Yes, I think the cartoons, honestly, they take me maybe 40 minutes for a cartoon or something like that.  If I think like end-to-end, like making the cartoon, exporting Figma, I think it's probably 40 minutes. And I've stopped doing them because they really, what was happening was, I had content written, but I didn't have the cartoons.  And then I was like, oh, , I need to do the cartoons. And then I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't post it.  And the cartoons were like just holding me back. And nobody ever mentioned the cartoons. So I was like, oh, nobody cares.  So I'll stop doing it. So I stopped doing it. But I would say that it takes me, I think, end-to-end, maybe three hours, something like that.  I think it depends. Something like that. Okay, two, three hours.

1:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So it's... Quite a bit, right? Yeah. But you enjoy it, that's the thing.

2:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I enjoy it, and I think one thing that made a huge, huge difference for me was that for those expertise demo things, I wrote them all in one go in December.  And now I'm posting them one by one. So there's three things that I think was good for that. The first one was that they all are kind of cohesive, because I wrote the first one, and the third one also relates to the first one.  So there's a lot of them about expertise demo, right? I think that's easier. Also, it just feels nice to know that I have my content for months ahead.  It was the first time I did it. I don't have more content now. I have just one more in the chamber.  And... The backlog. Yeah. All And the other thing is, it forced me to not do them at the last moment, like when you're finishing work for school, and you're like, oh my god, the teacher is coming, I need to do the thing, because I sent my newsletter on Saturday.  I was like, okay, this is done, and there's a research. So, yeah, it was good.

3:25 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I wanted to ask you, because I noticed something, you know, I put money in the marketing team, right now I'm shutting them off, because I know I like to create content and things like that, but I noticed that 80% of my clients don't come from social media, they come from references.  I want to put just the content that I want to be out there, just to cultivate, because my kind of marketing or promotion, it's just planting seeds.  For their interaction, I have one client that just contacted me yesterday and he told me, have, I've been doing like, I'm thinking of taking the experience with you, but I've been thinking about for two years now, maybe I'm getting closer to the decision.  And it's like, you people maybe take one year or two years, and this is for social media, but it's just a 10%.  But now I have another guy from Houston that I met yesterday, and he took one year to take the decision of doing the experience with me.  And I'm thinking, you know, what's the, what's the power of social media? Because most of my clients, they don't come from me for social media.  Maybe I'm becoming a reference for a lot of, because I have a lot of followers, like coaches, psychologists, therapists that do this work, but it's more like they want to see what I do, but not to gain clients.  And I wanted to ask you, how many clients do you get from the Substack?

5:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know if I got a client from Substack.

5:06 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or what social media do you use or LinkedIn, right? Do you get clients from LinkedIn or from references?

5:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think it's almost always references. Right. But I think, so I've been debating myself about that, the whole content thing, and I've been thinking about it, and there's a few things I'm noticing now.  So the first one is that there's the rule of marketing, right? I think 5% of your clients are in the buying mode at any given time.  So your content is for the 95% guys that are not ready yet, but they'll be ready at some point.  If they remember your thing, right? So we are in a kind of coaching expertise business sort of thing. That's kind of apparently the rule of thumb.  So most people will not buy immediately. So our expectations of getting a lead from content, they need to be adapted because otherwise we just get very discouraged.  So that's one thing. And the other thing is I've noticed that when we get a lot of people that are like competitors or people like us following us, it seems to be that it's because we're talking about the techniques and they understand the techniques, but the clients don't understand the techniques.  The clients understand the problem, right? So I haven't been So I able to get really deep on that yet with my content, but it makes sense to me that I should be talking more about the problems that people feel than the solutions to those problems.  And this feels like very obvious, but when you sit down to actually create the content, it's so much easier to go back to the things that we know, the techniques and so on.

7:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I think that also, like, you know, the experts that follow us, they actually don't know the techniques, like they cannot know, but that's why they are there, because we explain it a little bit in depth and things like that, because they might think they know, but they don't know how to apply it.  You know, they have heard it or they've seen it, but they don't know how to implement it. So that's why they look at it, but also I was thinking, and sorry for opening this conversation, but it's good to conversate with you, because we're in kind of the same industry.  And I noticed. Also, like, there's these experts versus influencers, so they create content and they sell, but just because they're influencers, not because they know their stuff.  They don't even have maybe some depth in what they teach, but they have influencer power, you know, like they are handsome or they're cute or they smile.  It's not that they value, but I think also, like, I was thinking, you know, we are not fighting for that attention, but people are also in, like, neurochemical loop of dopamine, so they are not actually aware of what they're consuming.  They're just, like, you know, like, I don't know, and it's, I've been thinking about that a lot, you know, about the content creation, and also, you know, like, how quickly could be the reference thing, because, you know, I just made out a curve that I'm asking for some ground.  And she liked my project, and the next day someone called me, hey, like, this girl recommended to you, right?  And I'm like, okay, like, tell me, how can I help you? You know, I've been doing psychedelics, and you know, like, but like that, you know, like, one day, she talked about me, and someone, like, they didn't even hear about me before, they don't know about my expertise, they haven't checked my Instagram, it's, you know, I want to have a session with you.  You know, it's like, how powerful it can be just a reference, you know? Like, they go with you without having to do a research on what do you do, how do you do it?  You know, like, I want to go with you.

9:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's the same thing that happened with you and me. Yes. Like, that was very quick. It feels great. So, I agree, there's this, like, this difference between being a visitor.  And expert, and being an influencer. And... In my mind, it's very easy to forget if we're playing a different game and start comparing ourselves to the influencer.  Like, I do it all the time. And then you're like, you know what, I'm going to create some posts that are very obvious.  Like, leadership is not about being the boss. Leadership is about being, you know, that kind of LinkedIn stuff. And sometimes I'm like, I should do those.  But it's difficult. It's like meditation. Your attention goes away and you know when I'll come back. So I agree.  I feel the same way, like you do. And also, someone told me that for my business, I should be going on podcasts.  Like, being very intentional and getting interviewed on podcasts that the people that I want to serve listen to, right?  And I'm thinking that maybe for you, this would also make sense. Because, like, if I remember correctly. Rafer. Absolutely.  Yeah, Totally. That's Interesting segment for you was the tech leaders, right? And they listen to podcasts, right? And if you could, I assume, like, get into that bubble, just because I know you've been on podcasts at least once or twice, right?

11:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I have the book that's coming on, you know, like, they interview me. So I hope that works a lot.  And I've been on a lot of interviews as well. Yeah, so I guess that's also a good thing for reference.

11:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have this tech leader.

11:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  He has 300 employees. He has a Hindu guy from yesterday. He has a tech company. you know, he came from a reference, actually.  He doesn't use social media, but he's like a big guy. He's doing a million a year. And he just say that he can sleep and he has family confidence and things like that.  But, yeah, everything else is fine. And he's doing money and things like that. But I sent him about a small book and a YouTube video.  For him to start understanding the process. And he tells me, I only do audiobooks. I don't do podcasts, but only audiobooks.  And I put it on repeat. And it's like, okay. And while we were in the one-on-one, he was always, Jorge, wait a minute.  Jorge, wait a minute. Can I call you in 30 minutes, please? Jorge, like, they're busy as F, you know, like, they're not present.  Not for their family, not for this, not for that, but they want to do something about that, you know, but, you know, they're in chemical everywhere and not here.  So it's interesting to try to, I don't know if that's a leader who's going to find me in a podcast.  He's going to find me with a reference, right? And I'm thinking I can only do my best work with those kind of people so they can share my expertise or reference.  But I also have these people that they want to keep. Then give me just to themselves, right?

13:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. You know, I got a sales coach.  He's a guy who lives in Spain, but he's Dutch. And he sales for nice people. That's his thing. And the thing is, like, I had no sales training at all.  Like, all my ideas about how to sell these things are, like, from movies and I don't know, right? And so they're wrong, and I'm really bad at selling my stuff.  And so I've been, you know, I got the training from this guy, and I'm going through his, like, sessions every week and so on.  And that's been useful. I can send you the link. But one of the things that was... What was interesting was the whole how to enter the conversation in a way that you come across as an expert, but you can also sell, right?  So it's not like the book, the movie is always be closing and stuff like that. It's not like that at all.  But it's also not, hey, maybe I know this thing. Maybe you like, because you know me, you've been talking to me, you know that I do that a lot.  Like, yeah, maybe let's see. I need to be a little bit more intentional about it. But I can send you the link if that's interesting to you.  Because the thing is, and this is my point, this guy is forcing me to interview people. And to see how they talk about the problems I solve.  Because that's very helpful in the way that I think that people care about. Something, but maybe they don't care about something, they care about something else, you know?  And these interviews are like the kind of thing that intellectually, we know we should do them, they make sense, we agree, but then we don't want to do them, right?  We find excuses, and I don't know how to start, you So these guys really forced me to do that.

15:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So when I started, I interviewed a lot of doctors, therapists, you know, maybe they were my competition, but I knew I had to bring them on so people know that when they listen to the interview, they know that I know stuff, you know, because I'm with a doctor or with this, and that helped me a lot, you know?  I had like maybe 30 episodes, but I stopped, but yes, because it takes time, you know, the podcast.

15:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, and also like...

15:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But you have really good people in your podcast, you know, like I follow all of them, I know all of them, and from Nick, from Spencer, I met Spencer through you, but you have really, really, really great people, you know?  I don't know, like maybe you and I are in that niche direction of the people that we choose to nurture our expertise.  I know that a lot of people don't know those guys, but it's good that you have them on board.  I acknowledge that. It's good. Thank you.

16:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. appreciate that. Yeah, I'm thinking about doing like this. I'm thinking about like the second phase of that.  But so I don't want to, I love this conversation. I really, I'm holding myself. So we love it. Right.  Yeah. It's a good sign. think. But so let me share the screen. And I will also share the link.  Security, set password, change password, change password. No, come on. Set password. Jorge, Jorge. Jorge. Jorge. Jorge. Jorge. Jorge. Is it correct?  Yes. Set Password. No. And here you go. Okay. There we go.

17:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. I've noticed that people are moving into between mirror, between mirror, between stigma, but I think I'm a mirror lover.

17:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I, you know, actually, I like mirror, but my feeling with mirror is that I use maybe 10% of the power of mirror.  It can do so many more things. Okay. So I've added a little bit more of the IDRs at the start, and I've changed some of the exercises.  If you want, we can go through the whole thing sequentially, or we can jump into the things that change the most.

18:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  What do you think is best?

18:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think you can do a zoom out level and then zoom in on the most important things. Perfect. Okay.  So I'll pull you to me. I'll let you finish that. I'll pull you to me. Okay. Pull me to you.  Okay. So we have the cover. Perfect. Perfect. then we have the intention and the objectives. We have the little agenda.  The agenda is not described in terms of like exercise number one, you get this exercise number two is a bit more in phases.  And then we've changed a little bit, almost nothing, the bit where we ask about the previous experience. When was it?  And the doses. We've changed the collage exercise. Not the exercise, but the canvas. It fits in one canvas. I think it's just better.  And then we also changed. changed. We included a legend at the bottom of the exercises where people can see their names.  The last exercises, we stopped using the legend because we are assuming that people already know these things. That's it.  As we move through it, there's the two options for the virtues. I kept both the one that says the little text boxes, and I've also created this more like visual one, and I can show you how people would use it.  And towards the end, we have the last exercise is split into two phases. The first phase is we ask what people will do exactly, and then the next one after that, it comes a little bit as a surprise, I think, for the participants.  But I think this could be interesting, the surprise, which is the timeframes, right? Because when people are thinking... About the ideas they'll have, it's quite possible that they will say very vague, broad, strategic ideas that don't really fit into, like, do it in the next hour or so, you know?  But when we ask them to commit to a time frame, I think there's an opportunity here also to test the waters in terms of what kind of deviation they usually take.  Do they usually make very small activities, or do they get really big activities? I suspect they'll go for the big ones.  I'm not sure. And at the end, we have the quick recap, and I also have some questions about that for you.  But basically, people would go back and pull the little post-its back to their spaces, okay? And they could export this.  Overall, this is the flow. And now we can dive deeper into anything, but do you have... How do you feel about this?  It looks great. It's time to test the waters. Time to test the waters, exactly. Do you have, by the way, do you have an upcoming session scheduled with someone?

21:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, with the guy that I told you, I have two, one a petroleum engineer from Houston, and the business owner CEO from this tech company from Dallas, Texas.  Yes, I have two coming up. So both of them are from Texas?

21:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Both of them are from Texas, yes. Interesting. Interesting. Okay, so this feels cohesive, right? Let's dive a little bit deeper into specifics.  So on this one, I kept it pretty simple. simple. So I've tried to get as correct Spanish as I could.  If you see some mistakes, apologize. We can fix them. And so there's no experience here. People are just, you know, following you through it.  We have used this as a gateway to the first activity.

22:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay. I'm in Big Phrase.

22:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. I'm sorry. I made this in a way that is not very easy to change. That was not very smart.

22:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or maybe just put it right, but put it in the front, like the white one. Okay. I'm just going to change.

22:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Okay. We'll be right back.

23:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm going to a big psychedelic conference in Denver, Colorado in June. Do you think it will be nice that I do some cards?  Because I'm going to do a lot of networking and maybe I can give my phone, but I think that card will be nice, right?  Just enough.

23:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Sorry, come again? card?

23:34 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm going to a big psychedelic conference in June in Colorado, Denver, and I'm going do, like, they're going to be, like, more than 10,000 attendees, scientists, entrepreneurs, founders, startups, all of them in the psychedelic space.  Do you think, as a networking thing, should I bring, like, letters, like my cards, like my presentation card or something like that, or just with the phone?  Amen. Hey, let's exchange phone numbers or something like that. What do you think would be nicer? I think it's good to have the cards.

24:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Right?

24:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, just in case, know, because it's tangible, like, they just can't have it. exactly. Yeah, okay, like, we can exchange the number and everything, but also give the card, you know, like, make sure, like, once they go to the room or they do the integration, it's, you know, oh, I met Orfe, you know, look at the card.  Let's see, like, what he does.

24:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exactly, exactly. Yeah, I would do that. Okay, thank you. All let's go back. Okay, okay, okay, let me just write down something else.

24:37 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Primera actividad, ¿cuál fue tu dosis? Mi experiencia psicodélica fue hace, mi dosis fue excelente, I like that. Pretty good.  And they put their name in the, depending on the color they use. Yes, that's one of the questions I have for you.

24:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, one way, one of the things. very Thank So the way this is designed right now is to make it easy to set up for different classes, for different groups, right?  So you do it once, and then you change it. And you would go, and yourself, you would just have to change the names in the legend, in the slides that have the legend, right?  And you do it, I think, three times, and everyone just follows it. You do it twice, and everyone follows it.  So that's easy to prepare in terms of, like, let's get ready for this. Another way of doing it would be to use their pictures for, like, from LinkedIn or something, you know, which is, you know, it's a little bit more work, but maybe there's more a certain sense of...  So this is some lady I just found on LinkedIn. They don't even know her, but, you know, it could just...  Something like this. Come on. Who's that? I have no idea. I just opened LinkedIn. I opened the first picture.  But this could be like a slide, the first slide, where people just introduce themselves or something. The problem with this is that it is a little bit more work for you to go after their pictures and put it in the right size and stuff like that.

26:30 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you think also this workshop can be used for just from 10 to 20 people, 30 people? Or if we want to also like exchange, I think maybe 30 is a lot, right?  I think we'll be fine with 15 people. But if I want to, yeah, 15, I think it would be nice.  Like, because I want to have this for individual format and collective format. I know. Deut For me, it's easy just to put one for the individual format, but, you know, this could be like also like the integration workshop.  But I don't know if I call it worship or a sprint because, you know, it's also a sprint of two hours to get clarity in what they need to do, you know.  But it's also because I think a lot of people see worship. I think we had this talk before. I wanted to put worship, but only the corporate people maybe know what's worship and what they hear worship is, you know, like, let's get together and it's not the actually let's do the collab thing.  I mean, I think a sprint also it's a tech concept, but a sprint is actually more conceptualizing to doing the thing.  I don't know why people do worship to do a conference or a speech, and they call that a worship, you know, like just them all the time.  Yeah.

27:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so there's a couple of things here. The first one, can we make this to serve a larger group?  Yes. We can. I think we need to change the way the slides look, because right now the slides are taught for like six people.  If we change it, I guess we would just make it... Just thinking. Yeah, I mean, basically, yes, that's possible.  I'm just thinking of how to change it quickly, and it could be... Oh, maybe I can show you something that could be an interesting technique.  Just a second. I'm opening something to use as an example. Okay. Share this tab. Okay. Okay. Do you see it changed, right, on mirror?  Okay, so this is what I did. I've created a bunch of different icons, and I just let people choose an icon.  Okay, so Larissa picked this one, Vinicius picked this one, and so on. then we have them here, and you just pick one lane, and you go through it, right?

29:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Each one is for each person.

29:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So there's three phases, and you always know, oh, my icon, because it's difficult for people to know everyone else's icons, right?  But if you just need to know your own icon, that's okay, right? So this thing is, for instance, nobody picked this one, nobody selected this one, but it was already prepared.  It was here, right? So if you are a participant, and you say, you know what? I want, I want this one.  I'm going to put Jorge here. Okay. And I'll tell you, hey, guys, please zoom out or come to me and you'll see your icon here.  Right. Make note of what's your icon. say, okay, so this is Jorge's icon. Right. And he came here and he say, Jorge.  Okay. Okay. And now we know that as we move through the exercise many, many times, you just need to look for this one icon because that's your icon.  The other guy has a different one, you know? And this is a way of having everyone, a large group of people going through the same sort of activities.  Right. Okay.

30:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I see. Yeah. I like that. And when, when I took a explain program, it's, it's some, it was something like that.  Okay, cool. I didn't take it.

30:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You have taken all the. I need to study more.

31:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But I explained what's expensive, and it was, you know, I think I told you this last time about Spencer.  I like the word Spencer is better, but I see that when they do a lot of complexity in the visualized, it's just too much, you know.  But I like Spencer one because they don't feel, they're complex, but they don't feel complex, you know, they go with you.  To explain, it's too technical, to cooperate, to call, you know. But they have like this thematic of like going in an airplane and things like that, but it's just gray and white, so it's not alive in a way.  Yeah, yeah.

31:45 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I understand. Yeah, there's like...

31:48 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  This workshop, it's about, because I don't understand it in Portuguese, but it says Vendera or Invesive?

31:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Selden Invisible. Okay, so.

31:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, interesting. Problem, perspective, and process is kind of like a creative process? Yeah, I can give you a very quick overview.

32:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So first we talk about the problems that people solve. Okay. And then notice that this is the third phase.  Then we talk about the way they solve those problems. And finally, we talk about a unique perspective that they have while solving those problems.  Right? So like in your case, I'm just going to improvise here, right? Yes. People seek the, you know, they seek insight in breakthroughs and they go through psychedelic experiences.  But sometimes or oftentimes they don't have the right framing for those experiences and they don't make the best. They don't extract all the good stuff from it.  Right? think Right? Yeah. And maybe they don't know how to find a good psychedelic guide or a psychedelic coach, and they just, you know, go for the Pachamama or the superclinical Swedish whatever.  And so you have a process, right? There's a way you do these things, which is related to what you and I did for the visual frameworks, like what kind of things you believe in, what kind of results you deliver, which steps you follow, what kind of tools you use.  And all of this stuff above is mostly to make you, it's supposed to be easy to fill in because it's very practical and concrete.  So the answers that the participant puts here at the top, they're usually not very transformative, but they just give you the confidence of, yeah, yeah, I know my , yeah, yeah.  But the interesting bit happens towards the end, right, which is the synthesis, like I do that by doing these things and I deliver this outcome.  Okay. And then finally, because if I have the problem and the process, that's enough to start talking about what you do, but it's not good enough for differentiation, right?  Somebody else that does the same thing could claim the same stuff. But you and I, we do kind of uncommon things.  I don't think we have much competition in that sense. But like, if I were a designer doing this thing, just doing what I do and the way I do it is not enough to create differentiation, right?  So that's why we have the third phase, which is the perspective, like things you believe that are true, that, you know, holds everything else.  And I think when I also went through stuff like this while doing the visual frameworks, and I'm using this as the middle, visually is the middle step, because it's the bridge between the problem and...  The way you solve it, right? The way you approach a problem is related to your perspective or the way you look at it, right?  So people went through this, and at the end, we had the A4 thing, which is similar in purpose to what we have for yours, where we just copy this stuff and bring it here, right?  Now we have these ingredients, which is, solve problems of, for clients that have the following characteristics, that look for or want to, I deliver these outcomes by following this process, and my approach is based on, because I believe that, okay?  And then this phrase is all messy. mean, you could make a phrase out of it, but it's all messy.  So here is just a space for us to rephrase it in a way that's a little bit more... ...  That makes sense, in a way.

  And you did this for an intro workshop, or it's for a team, or it's nice. It's kind of like a short experience of what could be a foundation sprint, know, like who do you serve, what do you do, how do you do it, how do you differentiate yourself, or what's your differentiation.  I like it. It's really nice.

36:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And I like how you design your stuff. Thank you. Thanks for sharing. So this was a free event. It was open.  I did it kind of to help a friend and have some content. And to be honest, I think I should run it more times to...  You could get clients just by having this process with you.

36:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  They are going to have the expert expertise demo with you.

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think that's, I think it's staring me in the face, and I should, I should do something with it.  But thank you, I really appreciate that. So, so the way, just to walk back, the reason why I showed you this was that this exercise, this workshop is made in a way that a lot of people could do it at the same time.  So, each person just follows their own track, and it's, there's links on it. So, we begin, I explain the model, and then I explain some basic ideas, and then we go to an exercise, there's a link, and we come here, you know, stuff like this.  So, this is to say that, yes, there's a way we could do it, that we have the same structure, we just repeat it, so that huge groups of people could take it at the same time.

38:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, but for now I think let's focus on the work that six people and maybe just have like this iteration and that we can do something like that for the bigger group, right?  Yeah, yeah.

38:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Because if the exercises work, I mean, it's...

38:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, first I want to try them, you know, and then we'll see like we make it like for a big group, right?  Perfect, perfect, perfect. now let's go back.

38:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I haven't looked at anything, but it's just a way of placing images here. Oh, another question. Miro, and we spoke about this, Miro has the option of including...  This kind of stuff, you know? and we talked Thank you. Okay, oh, how do you do it?

39:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let me show you.

39:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You come here, on the plus sign, and then you come on the marketplace, and you look for Unsplash, I believe.

39:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Market, marketplace, where are you?

39:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Or tools, I sometimes get this confused. Unsplash. Marketplace, Unsplash.

39:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, Unsplash. What?

39:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was just here. I don't have it.

39:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ah, images and icons.

39:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, so maybe you don't see it. Do you see this plus sign here? Do you see it? Yes, but I don't find the name of the app.

39:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm in the marketplace.

39:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and then are you on search now? Yes. Okay, so let's put pictures, images and icons here. see Let's on  Do you see it? Yes, now I see it. Okay. Okay, we're good to go. And can I drag it here?  Yeah, I can drag it here. Can you drag, please try to drag a picture. A new one. Okay, so this works.

40:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I put Neo from Matrix and it didn't show, but maybe we have lots of different pictures, but not just, not like the movie characters or things like that.  Hmm.-hmm. Yeah, it's possible.

41:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's possible. Because of copyright and stuff like that, right?

41:12 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, let's move forward because I don't want to rush, but time is of the essence.

41:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. So then we go into that activity, we have the legends, and we suggest people to... Clara, of course.  Here's another question I have for you. Sometimes, if you put like arrows and drawings, say, oh, like a hand, drag this thing...  Sometimes those things make it easier to understand. How do you feel about that?

42:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you repeat what was the question? For sure.

42:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So sometimes if I have, like, here this post-it, oh, there's an instruction, just click here and write your thing.  We can also include a visual, like an arrow, that says write it and then drag it here, right?

42:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, maybe just in the lower part of the blue square, we could put once you're done, like, you know, maybe here.

42:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ah, okay.

42:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Once you're done, put it wherever resonates more with the outcome or something like that. Perfect.

42:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect.

43:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Cool, cool, cool, cool. Cuarta actividad. Mira tu collage y elige. Y selecciona lo más impactante.

43:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)

43:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Perfecto. Perfecto, perfecto, perfecto. Next. Quinta actividad. ¿Qué enfrentaste, descubriste o aprendiste? enfrentaste, o Con mi experiencia psicodélica frente a descubrir, aprendí que.  aquí ya. word translating the experience into insight. Yes. then we're going to move from insights to a strategy or solution, but for now it's insight.  Hay algo más ahí. Sexta actividad. ¿Y cómo? Sí. ¿Cómo eso estaba? ¿Cómo eso te estaba impidiendo vivir tu mejor vida?  Eso me está impidiendo vivir mejor vida porque... Nice, nice, nice. I like that. Nice. Séptima actividad. Elige tres valores, virtudes o...  ...factor... Fathom, Asistente Virtual de Jorge, Jorge Elizondo,.com, expandiendoconsciencia.com, and expandiendoconsciencia.com. Valentia, confianza, paciencia, creatividad, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, generosidad.  these are different.

45:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The ones at the top are the ones we had, and the ones at the bottom I went to look for the 10 virtues of Buddhism.

45:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Oh, these are the ones bottom I went virtues of generosidad, paciencia, determination, discipline, discipline, Conducta etica, bush. Don't, energy, equanimity, loving, kindness, or compassion, whatever.  I like that. they are going to, like, you know, like, put your name, whatever you want to develop something more, you know.  And now it's, you know, first, the first step inside, second step, choosing what to cultivate. Like, I call it maybe the seed framework, you know, like, choose what you want to plant, you know, in your, you know.  So maybe people think that it's about changing a habit, but sometimes it's just about cultivating a new energy, right?  So a lot of people that, you know, like, oh, it's because I don't have this, you know, so what do you need to cultivate?  Let's do that. So maybe it's not just about more determination, but more compassion about yourself, because you're... How do exigir?  Demand. Demand. Oh, you know Spanish, yes, a lot.

47:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Exigir demand, yes.

47:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Ok, so, ok, I like that. Octava actividad. ¿Qué comportamientos necesitas soltar ahora mismo? ¿Qué comportamientos? Ah, ok, ok. It's one, relaciones o creencias.  Ahora mismo, sin excusa para alinear. I don't know how to fix the space, but I don't know if you want to make smaller the words, but a number of participants.  I don't know.

48:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What was that, sir? Do you like Rick and Morty?

48:08 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, yeah. started just watching the season one.

48:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What am I watching? We were watching Barry. Oh, Trailer Park Boy is so stupid. I have a friend that loves the show.

48:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Sometimes it's good to refresh, right? Just to watch stupid stuff.

48:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's so silly.

48:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And you know, I like how it starts to dissolve, right? Because we don't want this momentum.

48:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. And the idea behind that that was... Of course, you get it, but is that we shouldn't make big promises too much in the future, because we don't know.  So really focus on the immediate stuff. Thank you. Thank you.

50:00 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You cannot. I fixed this one, but not the rest. Okay. So I think this is... Did you remember what we had here in the past?  Because we had... I think this is the clean version, but we have a different... What was the purpose of each section, you know?  Like, before coming in, I want to split, you know, the purpose and the agenda, you know?

50:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yeah, I know we have the agenda. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. There was some post-its, right?  Yes. Okay. I can get them back.

50:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Just to make sure, because I think those were good ideas of what we... Like, what was the actual mechanism of each section, you know?  For me to have this, like, as a meta framework, meta framework to develop more exercise. Just already with what we want to do in each section, right?

51:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it, got it, got it. Makes sense.

51:15 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  From experience. And also with this, with the PDF, it also, it's good for me to have them to also, you know, when they put, you know, I'm going to do this in an hour or the next day, I can do a follow-up tomorrow.  For me, it's easier, you know, and I put it in my notion, and I have an application with the health of the user, and, you know, like, do what you wanted to do, and I send them a screenshot, you know, like.

51:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm to do that.

51:56 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, in front of me, I'm working with a team that are developing my. Notion OS, because I bought lots of templates and things like that, but maybe I need something custom made.  So once I have it, I can show you maybe that would be nice for you and the clients as well to have, you know, like the history of what you have done for the client and what results have you done together.  They have like a graphic of what are the things that you have built. And what I'm thinking in the Notion, when they're in the Notion and they have this portal to themselves, at the very back, they're going to have this ecosystem of services.  You know, like if you want to keep working with me, these are my productized sprints if you want later on in life, right?  Selling, they have like all the money down in the portal. Hmm, you want me to show, I me to check that out.  Yes, it tries to, right? Yes, yes, yes. But yes, I I like it. I like it a lot. Thanks.  Thanks. Thanks.

53:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. So I have a few things here to correct and tidy up. Okay. Um, let me put, right. Bring back also now.  Yeah. Or post-its. Uh-huh. Um, when do you have, I mean, I can do this, uh, this week, of course, but, okay, let's agree on our next steps then.  So I'll correct these things and, um, you'll run a session or two with these guys. Is that it? Yes.  Okay. Cool.

53:49 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So for, for, integration, they haven't done the sprints. They're going to have it the, the last day of, uh, June.

53:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So a bit of time.

53:58 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So, uh, but yes, I want to do the. And maybe with this, it's easier to do the preparation one.

54:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect. Perfect. So, okay, this is exciting. I'll cross the T's and dot the I's. I'll send you an email with that.  Let me know when do you run it, because if you want, we can practice or do something like that.  Maybe I can do it tomorrow.

54:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  have a meeting with a kind of mastermind with my guys, just to make, like, it doesn't have to be perfect.  With what I have now, maybe I can test it, and I can explore the possible, I can send you a loop, you know, like, oh, I saw this.  This is what happened, or maybe we can change this and just, like, keep working.

54:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure, for sure, for sure. Also, none of this thing is locked, right? Because in that way you can copy and...  Paste it on your own Miro, but when you run it, like this thing should be, we should lock some things so people don't break it when they start using it.  But right now it isn't locked, so we can just copy it and paste it on your own Miro, but later that's important to do.

55:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Awesome. Awesome.

55:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Always a pleasure talking to you.

55:33 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I'll wait on you, on the email, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It should be done this afternoon, I think. Perfect.

55:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  So I'll wait on you. Thank you. Thank you.

55:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's always a pleasure to work with you. Yeah, it's good. It's good. Thank you so much. I'll let you be now and I'll send you an email.  Always a pleasure. Let me look at you. Thank you. Take care. Ciao.
