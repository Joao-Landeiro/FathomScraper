  Hello.

0:02 - Ivan Ćelić
  What's cracking? Nothing. Nothing is cracking?

0:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Nothing. So the schedule, we had suggested this time frame, so that's why I changed it.

0:22 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, we can wait for her to join. Yeah, she'll be. I don't know if that was helpful.  Thank Hello. Hello. Hey.

1:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So... Romeo, você quer falar sobre Integrity Hub? Pode ser, João.

1:27 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Ontem eu atualizei aquela série de conversores. Aham.

1:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Aqui nos ajustes.

1:34 - A L
  Pode, talvez, validar. Vou usar aqui para...

1:38 - Romeu Rodrigues
  Ah, coloquei. atualizei aqui. Pode aumentar mesmo o link, né?

1:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uhum. Ok. Ok. Ok. Perfect. this is just based on yesterday's conversation, updating the integrity hub. Yeah. We pulled the sources and documents here to this side, also the buttons, and we moved everything that wasn't, okay.  So I think we are in agreement on that thing. Yeah, I think this is good. Oh. Come again?

2:26 - A L
  No, I think, yeah, I think this is good for the kind of like the short term. think that, yeah, eventually we'll try to change some of the controls and not to be a semi and then maybe make it a little bit more cartoony or exciting.  But I think this is like much better. yeah, the right directions. I think it's good. Perfect. Thank you.

2:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in terms of the priorities now, what's ahead of us is this whole great custom questions. And how to create a new policy in the new format.  However, given that we are at this kind of crossroads moment that we have another call right now, it feels to me that maybe between, know, for the rest of the week on the design side, the best use of the time would be to go through what we have with a fine tooth comb and just correct various inconsistencies and stuff like that, that do not require like new features, new pages, new stuff like that.  How do you feel about this?

3:36 - A L
  I think it would be good to do like an update of the compliance map that I made. I know like it might not be the final version, but I have meetings with all of our customers and I need to convince them to kind of stay on our platform.  And it's like a nice visual. could be like, hey, look, the compliance map is already there. Like these are kind of the topic areas that you need to do to give them a little bit of comfort to buy.  Even if that means that that compliance map might change later on and not actually look like that, but just sometime like cleaning it up making sure like the graphics make sense or the colors make sense and that just so that that's also good for like a selling point of view to as I talked to.  As I talked to try to bring in new pilots into the BSE cycle.

4:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. But so in that sense. When you show the platform today to to new possible clients, are you already showing it from the perspective of the SME or are you showing it still on the same?

4:36 - A L
  No, like today I had a customer that really wanted ISO 14,001 and I was like not sure that we're going to do ISO 14,001.  To be honest one just because I just felt like I'm realizing like ISO 14,001 at the budget that I had originally set like it would end up like spending so much hours getting him up to speed and like then we'd have to build off the rest of the platform for ISO 14  2001 for that that I told him I'm like I'm sorry. I don't think we're you know given the news of BSME I I don't think I'm gonna prioritize development of 14,001 It just and then and then he actually was interested in BSME So we have another call in two months where I said I would share him with him a little bit more around it So I haven't done anything.  I've just been talking but this is like, you know a day by day it changes So that's why I would like to be able to show the compliance map like SME like version to like prospective customers as we get them and Just saying like BSME changing this, you know, this is update of a platform that we're building We want you to join our pilot to help us discover how we're gonna do this when we build it So to have like a starting point of it is very helpful for that discussion Got it but just I'm creating the card as we speak here on JIRA but Just to be clear.

5:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do we have do you have a slide in the presentation that compares the previous vision for No, I

6:00 - A L
  I don't, I don't think I want that because we never finish building the full vision right like we kind of stopped it now like with controls and with with With policies, you know, and if we want to like But I I think we mean different things by vision when I when I say this is that it used to be closed to The the Toyota but still a Toyota for a complex thing, right?

6:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now it's a Toyota for a simple thing, right? So I Would imagine that for people that you have talked to before A slide that doesn't have to have Illustrations just like it used to be this we're exploring this now In terms of like a list of features It I would imagine that steers the conversation in an interesting direction and also Instead of showing them what they can expect and then maybe it will change Just see how they react to that Change in direction, right because otherwise they'll  their feedback so if you give people a screen like a UI visual thing they will comment on the UI right but if you give people more of a a note and a concept of what's about to change then they can participate on a more strategic level but I'm creating the character.

7:20 - A L
  Yeah I think it's both like but I think more like you can have one slide I kind of compare the change but I think it's more important to kind of say where we're going and what it looks like because I realize like and like what the scope of the new thing is in terms of what it covers and I do think it's like I agree that it's going to change and like and that but I I feel like it's better just to have updated compliance map to kind of show it's like we're already thinking about how to change our platform this may change in the future you know based on feedback and you joining the thing but this is kind of the essence because the compliance map is often a selling point when I talk to customers like they  get in like oh I get it like you're really simplifying it for us so we're getting able to have a picture of that now even if that's not totally the way they'll kind of understand how we're different from other ones having that compliance map updated so I think that um yeah I think components align colors and then you can say like icons like the icons I just copy and paste it randomly but the icon to match the text or the the area like environment social governance there and then maybe a differentiation somehow of you know the basic and the comprehensive right now I just kind of put it on top and the bottom like should comprehensive colors be just a lighter version or a darker version of all of the colors and basic you know in the sections so then it's like it's still green but it's dark green because it's harder and I don't know like um that could be something like that got it

9:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Rumeu, can we talk about this?

9:02 - Romeu Rodrigues
  In general, it clear to you what it Yes, you can speak like this.

9:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And these are the high priorities and estimates.

9:18 - A L
  Yeah, it would be great if we can get it by the end of the week, because I'm also starting to talk.  I do think that I was talking with our investor today, telling them that we're most likely... I'm more happy to hear this, but we are probably in the sense that I think we can't straddle two worlds, especially with BSME coming in.  And so that we will probably have to be very focused on BSME, meaning that we will probably lose Hydro Rain, Ochre.  We will probably lose the companies that have an experienced compliance or sustainability person, because they're always going to want more than the basic, because they're actually experienced in this role.  And then those are the ones who have been pushing our tool, kind of being like, can you include this?  Whereas the smaller ones that don't have anything they will take whatever they can get at the easiest way And I think that's where the market is especially with the SME Got it.

10:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You hear me? Yes. Yes Yeah, we heard you. Yeah, so that is good news And then Vester was okay with it.

10:27 - A L
  was like could I also have to tell him because the investor comes from Awker all of their Awker companies is like our investors I was like just to let you know where like if we go this path We're probably gonna have to lose these people and he was like no I get it I see where you're going with this.  So it was fine. So that so so I'm gonna meet with all I've set up appointments with all of our customers for next week to like them discuss this with them and see which One who'll join us on BSME which ones want the other one and how even the good thing is that for these like huge Orrain Awker horizons offer this if they don't want to join us on the platform  they still as a larger company, they should be still asking the SME of their supply chain, right? So then there'll be an option where they don't use our platform to manage their sustainability, but they use part of our platform to get the questionnaires from that.  So there's still a way to and to work with them on that and be like, how would that look as a company if you needed to collect this information from a lot of people?  What's the easiest way for you to collect this information? So there's still an opportunity there, but I have a feeling that we'll lose them in terms of actually using platform for the reporting.  Got it, got it.

11:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think that's that's good news. mean, it would be very, very difficult, I think, to manage the complexity of platform that would serve such different use cases, right?  And I think that's a benefit of the of this, you know, customer discovery process that, you know, by talking to people and understanding what, what matters the most.  We're not so blinded. So yeah, that's good news, for sure. OK, so we've discussed Integrity Hub. We've discussed how to tidy up the compliance map.  Anything else you guys want to touch on? I don't know if we owe something to Ivan and the developing team.  Well, that's from our side.

12:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, what are you working on, Mike? Then you have that release, right? Yeah, we release controls on test and production, and we are finalizing that, so we'll need that tomorrow just to release the dashboards.  Also, the morning is almost finished with the API. think that Zari is also close to being done. We just need to connect now the API and the frontend, which I expect to be done sometime tomorrow and our time.  during our day, we expect. We are aiming for release of dashboards sometime tomorrow during our day. OK.

12:59 - A L
  And then. And then after that next week, it's maybe the upload of policies or like Probably if we are done with there for tomorrow then Friday we start on up all policies Okay, and then we have to think about like yeah, and we can have another conversation if I don't want to Yeah Yeah, it's end of month is Monday.

13:20 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think so. Yeah, we will discuss. I will have another thing I think I need to go to the door just Okay.

13:29 - A L
  Um, no, then I think it's it's fine then. Um, We can catch up but even let me check my schedule Uh, yeah, I can be like 1 p.m Uh tomorrow.

13:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, what's 1 p.m your time my time my time your time

14:01 - A L
  Yeah, your time as in also time. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

14:07 - Ivan Ćelić
  I could put something in there to discuss. I mean, we don't have to have it thoroughly if you need to.  I mean, like back to back meetings, like after that.

14:18 - A L
  I've been so jet lagged, I've been waking up a little bit earlier. Like today I had even.

14:27 - Ivan Ćelić
  So I just send it to you.

14:30 - A L
  Okay. All right. Okay, then I think we could just drop off now or I don't know, I can.

14:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  I guess we just opened the door.

14:46 - A L
  Has Brayton been doing any QA testing on this new version? No, like on this new one, we did it ourselves.

14:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  but we'll ask her to do everything together just so that it's complete.
