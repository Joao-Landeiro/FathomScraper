0:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  by January, mid-January timeframe, we would be able to test it if you like what you see. So that's what I'm hoping to do.  so that's good. I think that's Xiao sitting here. Hello.

0:17 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Hey.

0:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Hi, everything.

0:20 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  How are you? Are you okay?

0:22 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Good, good. Thank you.

0:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Xiao, do you want to introduce yourself while we're waiting for the other people and maybe do it after everybody comes?  But yeah, everyone else. For sure.

0:32 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  So I'm Xiao, I'm calling you from Brazil. there's the design team here in Brazil. And maybe you've interacted with people from X that they are joining now.  And they've done a really good job of structuring the project and you know, developing the whole architecture of things.  And we're doing this handoff so that we the design team here in Brazil will fly. shout everything and create the experience as imagined and also based on feedback from you and other prospective clients.  Now, are there?

1:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I used the MCS connection. Yeah, that's funny.

1:19 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  was just talking about everything.

1:21 - Mau Medeiros (doisemes®)
  good morning everyone. So my name is Marisa and I'm of the business unit. Oh, it's really strong transformation. Yeah, we're working on the platform along with everybody.  Yes.

1:38 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And Serendu, do you want to introduce yourself? Yes, my name is Serendu Khandilwal.

1:47 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I live in the other side of the world from you, Scotland.

1:55 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, very cold.

1:56 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Not as cold as where Abby is living, very, very, very cold. We run a commercial laundry company here that supplies to health, care, sector, hospitals, hospitality, weed hotels, and work ware for the garments that are used in oil rigs and oil and gas sector.  We have about five different plant geographically situated in various parts of Scotland, employ about 100 people. are in a newbie, we are a newbie in ESG domain, Abby is very kindly let me in to see what I need to learn from you guys.

2:49 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Great, but let's just jump in because there is a lot of information and I'm very eager. I don't know, Pinar, if you want to share your prototype.  I was saying to surrender we actually have, you know, the policies, procedures and trainings that part done, but let's jump into the prototype so you can see and then we can ask some questions.  So this is probably changed a little bit since you looked at it. One thing I would say, like the thing on the left, we added, which is the plan do act and review.  don't know if you recognize it because you guys have done ISOs before.

3:26 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  But this is a very ISO methodology of how they do it.

3:31 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So we mapped what we do to the ISO methodology. So it's very clear because over the last few months, we've also been talking to ISO auditors and having partnerships with ISO auditors so that they get familiar with our platform.  then they'll be with the easier audited in a cheaper way. So yeah, so this is what it looks like.  You saw I think you saw policies, procedures, trainings and communications before.

3:58 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I think you saw some control.

4:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  So maybe we can go to risk assessment or we can go to third-party management, maybe. Let's go to third-party management, I guess, first.  So third-party management is, you know, this is on the governance side. Also on the east side, you need to do something, but we tried to balance it becoming a third-party management tool with, like, a Rolls-Royce version of it, or actually more of a simple Toyota version, and because I bought a Rolls-Royce version in my last company, it cost a lot of money.  So what we say is, like, if you go to number one, step one, we talk about, you know, getting an overview of your annual spend from your suppliers from procurement or from accounting based on the supplier ledger.  Select the suppliers based off of an amount, like, that you've spent on them, and then you go down, and then you need to refine them by, if you go down to step two, you know, then you go down, can refine them by sector, country, product, services.  and reputation. And then you come down with a smaller list that you upload into our system. We would kind of help you do this offline and then we'd upload the final version here.  And from there, you would have a questionnaire that you can send to the third parties to be able to gather information that's already pre-filled around different, like this is on the S1, but there's one for E, there's one for G, depending on if you want to do ISO 14,001 or ISO 37,001.  And then, again, it deploys and then you can track the responses there. So that's the third party part. And then you have the risk management part.  Oh, yeah, we can see the vendor page. guess, yeah. Yeah, you can see the vendor details here and then you can have to do follow-up meetings.  Yeah, but is the vendor at your question? Yes. Yes.

6:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  One thing, whether it is at all going to be captured in anywhere in this platform, what we are experiencing is when we are looking at supply chain visibility, which is exactly what is coming here.  Two things become very, very prominent for scope three purposes. One is what product we are buying and what is the CO2 footprint of that particular product.  Is that somehow captured anywhere when we are looking at supply chain visibility? Not in particular.

6:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think we have a note section where you can add it or if you want, we can add a field so that it becomes a thing that you have to check.  But in this tool, if there's no automatic CO2 calculation for product that you Yeah, I understand that would be extremely complicated.

6:52 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  So it is almost impossible to build into anything. But in the background, have calculated, say, we've by ball bearing and the CO2 equivalent is 25 kilos for every kilo ball bearing or something to that that effect.  Can we put that information in so that it gives us a comparative analysis of what is the CO2 footprint of a various product?

7:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I mean I'm not saying that the system calculates any of that just because yeah I think that I hadn't thought about that but that's just the field so I think we can and then you can pull data analysis from it so it's more like yeah we can do that I even it's not on this call but we can do this because it's just the field so we can add a field and do that as long as we don't have to do the calculations on the back end no no no the calculations are extremely complex yeah yeah exactly so that's why I got a little nervous when you said that but yeah we can and this is part of the pilot right to like kind of work with you and say okay what would be helpful for you to be able to collect information as long as we don't have to do like the calculations then I don't see it as  issue there. But I can write it down and let him know, but I don't think it'll be an issue because it's another field you need to add to, and then a dashboard that you can pull the information, the numbers from.  Okay, cool. If we go back to risk assessment, then the top, so this is also like, you know, the first step would be to familiarize yourself with a typical ESG risk there.  And then you can, and then you would collect the baseline data, but should we enter the first one? So these are the kind of different risks that you have, and they have eyes next to them that you can explain a little bit more just so you understand, you know, what each one means if you were to start.  And we may tailor this more to the ISO when we get to the process. And then you start the risk assessment.  Yeah. And then it goes into like, you know, these are the risks that they think, but you also, as part of the risk assessment, you need to look at both internal.  external resources. So it's like, have you looked at external resources like the transparency index, ASSASB, the universal rights index, yes or no, and then add evidence of that.  Have you looked into internal resources like policies and employees? One, have you done research on competitor companies? Have you done, you know, research on countries that they're operating in, research on the sector?  That, and then based off of that, are there any additional risks that you might see out of the ones that you have on your left, and then you add them, and then they'll get automatically populated into a questionnaire that you have.  Yeah, and then you go to the questionnaire, and so we have one questionnaire that's already set up based off of a probability impact on the organization and impact on the society, and then, yeah, and then you go from there.  Yeah, Srinja?

10:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Just at the end of it, does it produce a risk matrix of any kind on various scales? Yeah, it does.

10:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think we have a picture of it that we're still developing, you can, yeah. As long as it is done, you don't have to show it to me.

10:15 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  As long as there is a risk matrix that does itself.

10:20 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah, I think it's there. So now you can see that these have been completed, and now you're in the, can, it's the, yeah.

10:36 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, do you have the risk?

10:38 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Yeah, there's the risk.

10:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Like that. But we, yeah, so that's kind of like the completion rate of who's responded, because the part of the part of that question is you need to send it to internal external stakeholders to get feedback.  then that, so that's the plan on that. So, yeah, and then we have the controls, maybe we, I don't know if we  but all the controls last time. Oh yeah, and then links to like the risk would link to different controls that would pop up.  But yeah, I'm not sure that this will be ready in three months, this part, but the other part would be.

11:18 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  2026 will do for us, Abby. Don't worry.

11:22 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Thanks. and then there's the control set up, like the controls part. I think we might have shown you that one last time, but these are like the different controls that are really set up there.  So yeah, so I think that's kind of the highlighted areas of what we've done since we talked to you.  And then we're also building the software. if you go to the compliance map, the our goal is that the risk assessment policies, procedures, trainings, communication and controls, and third party will be done by the end of this year, hopefully, fingers crossed.  And then we'll continue to work on some of the other ones. So there is like... Well, we would like to do is to start prepping with the pilots for something in late January, mid to late January to start picking one or two of these.  And it could be also be done offline. if you're interested, like, would you be interested in trying like ISO 14001, like, at least the methodology or ISO 37001, then we can kind of start doing some things offline and then making sure that we have the right methodology that we can stick into this one and kind of launch.  So that's what we already have ISO 14001.

12:33 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  So I'm not sure how, how much that will be useful for us. Remind me what 37001 was for.

12:40 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  37001 is anti bribery systems. Okay, what we are actually going for is ISO 140064268.

12:51 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah, that is for carbon neutrality and all those kind of things, but obviously that is not. sure whether you had looked at that and we can look at each side of it and can use this for that purposes.

13:08 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's the possibility, it is on my list but I would say that I would need to compare like the different controls like if those controls are already mapped out like then we can kind of put them in the boxes right and then you can use this as a digital tool for that for that.  So I think I would need to look at that more or if you already have it like you know what the policies, procedures and trainings are, know you have those ready then we can just deploy it because this just becomes a tool like a lot of the content would come from yourself you know what I mean and then we would be the tool to do it but I think it depends yeah.

13:42 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I'm not sure it would be helpful for you but I'm I'm suggesting this for your purposes and it's up to you whether you use it or you or not.  At this point in time we have we are forced into using a platform called EcoVirdis which is mainly coming from our from our customer  It's not something that we like particularly well because it is one size for all kind of a thing, but I mean, I can give you access to that, you can have a look and see where we are so that if you want to see what is happening in the marketplace, that can give you a fair idea.

14:26 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, no, thank you. think we've looked at eco monitors. I might have been a member of my last company.  I think we had a silver score, that no, that could be helpful. But do you think that like, because some of our, our pilots are like, we don't want the ISO.  We just want, we just want to make sure that we have like a compliance management system ongoing. Is that like, it's like, I'm just trying to think like where could like, and then some of them are like, we only want to use the control part because we have an LMS for the communication.  So we don't have, you know, the control part being executed because you can also go. I realized we didn't talk about the employee portal.  are the updated version of it, so I'm just trying to figure out like you know what would be most interesting in here that you know yeah would be interesting for you guys to use at one point.

15:09 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I think ISO is the most interesting for us clearly but the fact that we are able to track all the activities of ESG is obviously an overarching thing I mean getting a validation from an external party like ISO etc is just a result of whatever else we are doing so we are in a way we are more interested in doing the right thing and capturing the right information rather than getting a certificate at the end of it but if we can do it in a manner that that helps us in getting that validation that's well and good really.

15:47 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah absolutely it's positive that's why we set it up this way it's like you're going to do it anyway you might get an extra thing for it so yeah so that's what I'm trying to figure out like for your 14,001  when are you up for a renewal or did you just complete it? I think it is some point in time middle of next year from my memory.

16:09 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Okay. That's one option.

16:11 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is that pretty manual process that you're using? is. At this point in time, it is.

16:16 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  At this point in time, is.

16:17 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  One option is, as you go up for a renewal, then it might even be faster just because this just automates a lot of the processes that you would need to do.  Maybe that could be a way to use this tool while we also look at the other ones like 64 and 68 or something like that.  don't know. 37.

16:37 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Look, it doesn't really have to pick all the boxes, but if this gives us a way to capture all the information and puts a bit of a dip in on the organization in terms of whatever actions they're doing, they have to populate here, then in itself will generate can be used for any amount of ISOs that you want to because ultimately.  what you're trying to put in one place is what policies, frameworks you have, how you are really implementing it, and how are you doing impact assessment.  if this platform achieves that purpose, is whether it is ISO 14,000 or 64 or 68, is rather immaterial. Yeah.  I think that's how we tried to set it up.

17:24 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Is that compliance map, which can be used across different ISOs, right? So it's more of the content. So more like, yeah, like what content can we help, you know, you have with or but you might already have it.  So it's more like, can we help you deploy it? Or like, you know, yeah, looking at like some of the other ISOs in there.  Or like even like, yeah, compliance management systems there.

17:48 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  in so far as our trial is concerned, think ISO 14,001 will be quite basic for our purposes, given that we are going for slightly more in depth.

18:01 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  you know, validation.

18:03 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  So I think we can look at the whole gamut of ESV and start populating it and then saying, look, this is where we are and if we want to get ISO 14,068 or whatever it might be, these are the extra things that we'll have to do that is independent of the system.  But look, everything that you do, whether it is 9001, 14001, 27001 or whichever way it is, the framework remains the same.  You have to have an understanding of what you're doing, why you're doing, have an evidence that yes, you're doing it in a right way.  It doesn't really matter. as long as it covers all the ESG side of it. Personally, I'm not too concerned whether it takes the box for 14001, 14001, 68 and so on and so forth.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

18:59 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  It's more about the deployment. than like the system around it and where you can store the documents and the evidence for it, especially if you have that already there, which is kind of like the compliance map.  I think I'm just more like hesitant because I'm trying to think like how could we help you, you know, with that with like 1064 or 68 because I'm not a subject matter expert on that yet.  So I'm definitely more comfortable with the 14,001, but if you guys have also already mapped out or know a lot about it, then we could just put that into our system, you know what I mean, and make it easier for you to gather that information.  But that's where I'm trying to figure out. But I could have a look at these two ISOs and see how different they are.  Yeah, more detail.

19:35 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah, there is more of a emphasis on greenhouse gas emission and everything to do with that, including sequestration of carbon and so on and so forth.  So it is a different field within ESG itself. Exactly. And it was on our list to do, it's more that we're trying to, you know, to start trying to prioritize on some, like a lot of ones are even less on the journey than you.

20:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Rui, do you have any questions or Xiaowu, too? I have a few. Yeah.

20:07 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  So, then you've been kindly accompanying us through this journey of very rapid design, concept development of five or six flows.  And I was just curious to first of all find out how would you describe your experience so far as a pilot user, specifically, what stood out the most to you?

20:37 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I think I've mentioned this to you, Rui, by the way, and I've been disappointed if you wouldn't have been asking me questions on this, but that, by the way, I have said it earlier as well.  One thing stands out is the sheer simplicity of it, where it is equally simple to be used. any level of the organization which makes it more gives us more chance of actually seeing through the real objectives of it rather than just it becoming a desktop exercise or a paper exercise.

21:18 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  Good thanks for that but I would you know still push you on trying to be a bit more critical and you know now that you're looking at what we've done so far and now we're in a transition to another design team but I would be interesting to know if you feel we have any opportunities we might have missed and what you've seen.

21:48 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  One thing I still can't get my head around is that the sun is not round but... No, no.

21:57 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  We missed that, yeah.

22:00 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  That's pinar for it's not but look from the point of view of where we are coming we are not coming from an organization that has a huge department of ESG working that is already working with three or four other platforms and have and has something to compare it with and say yeah this one does that or this one doesn't do that we were not coming from any of that.  That mindset what we are trying to see is whether it covers all the aspect of our footprint of ESG to the point where if we do roll it out would we be supported by the people for us both internal and external and would they be able to understand everything and help us.  And when I look at it from that point of view I find this to be extremely helpful. I've lived through eco-virus for the last three months.  I can't give that to anyone in my organization.

23:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  They will kill me.

23:07 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  They'll say, why are you subjecting us to this? That is the problem with most of these platform is that they make it so complicated, because they're trying to be all things to people.  That it loses things of not sure what negative things I can tell you, except of stop asking me negative questions, please.

23:38 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  But then probably we'll rest my case there. Jao, you're going to be up and asking questions, and do you have any questions, Jao?

23:50 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, I do.

23:52 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's more related to- I think Jao is always ready. You have always some questions ready, so it's good. This is more like a clarification question to see if I understood it correctly.  I got the impression that this tracking of the policies or the tracking of the certifications is interesting, but you also seem to have expressed a desire for tracking of other objectives that are perhaps not necessarily ISO, but other things related to this.  Did I understand that correctly? That is correct.

24:29 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  What we are trying to do is to cover all the aspects of ESG. Now, not everything has been translated into ISOs.  So if you look at, say, gas emissions, we are looking very, very heavily in terms of our carbon footprint and exactly how it is embedded in our organization, how much of it is existence-based and how much of it is product and service-based.  and we are going very deep into that kind of analysis for our purposes now.

25:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  An ISO or anything, if you start it from the ISO point of view, you won't be doing all those kind of things because all the end game is to get an ISO certification.

25:19 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  That's not what we are starting from.

25:23 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Our starting point is what do we need to do? Do we have a good understanding and if at some point in time we need an external validation?  Is there an ISO standard that we can adhere to? yes, that is the reason why perhaps our need in certain areas of ESG will be broader in comparison to ISO.  And I'll give you another example. We sign up to a lot of public procurement contracts and we have community benefit plan that we work with.  with these public sector bodies that are roughly 250 to 300 initiatives that we are working or we choose from and working in social side of it and that is alike to social development goals.  I'm not sure how UN social development goals have been brought into this platform because we are allowing all of our social side with 17 of the social development goals.  Now, that is nothing to do with ISO. There is no ISO to say that you have. Actually, there is one coming out, Surindra.

26:37 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  There's one coming out at the end of next year, so we're going to try to be one of the first movers on that one.  Great, great.

26:45 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  We are looking for this as a tool to basically capture all the things we are doing on the ESG side of it.  Some of it may lead to ISO, some of it may not, but ISO is a result.

27:02 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's not the tail wagging the dog, I'm not sure I'm able to explain that. So let me paraphrase what I've heard because I'm interested in understanding like what's the mental model, you think about these things.  what I hear, please correct me, is ISO is about being legible to the market, but there are things that you're doing that did not fit on ISO, but you want to be able to talk about them and to have them at hand to bring into proposals and to communicate internally and externally.  It's like, I don't like the word arsenal, it's too war-centric, but it's a little bit like that.

27:42 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah, it's a mise en place.

27:43 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  You have all the ingredients and depending on which thing you need to do for the proposal or for an interaction with a other organization, you have all the information at hand that explains all of the things you've been putting energy into.  Kind of like that?

28:02 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Where are you based in Brazil now? In the south, Curitiba.

28:07 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Lovely.

28:08 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  mean, you couldn't have put, I couldn't have put it any better than that. Next time I'm in Brazil, I'll go and find you and have a cup of coffee with you.  We'll do that, we'll do that.

28:18 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  You're very good at synthesizing information, a very good skill at that, yeah.

28:23 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  But I think, like, I have been thinking about that.

28:25 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  I think I have been like, of like, all right, let's get this out on 14,000, 137,001. what it's meant to, because some of our customers don't want them, they just want a management tool for their different areas.  we have to think out in it, like, you know, the controls, yes, we set them for ISOs, but there has to be an option for, like, add new controls, you know, or add, like, for the reporting, add new reporting, so then we add, like, or add new tasks so that people can add their tasks, whatever, outside of the ISO process, but they're still able to track it within the system.  So I think that, like, I've kind of been like, oh, let's get this part really focused on the 14,001, but there are, yeah, probably half of our pilots are just like,  just want a management system to be able to manage this. We have to find that right balance of trying to get the bulk of the things that you want if you want to get ISOed, but also have the flexibility if you want to change something as they add some fields that they want to collect, then that we can do that.  I think that's what we need to consider from then. Thank you.

29:21 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I think this will, when you do compete, this will really help us in moving forward and putting everything in one place.  And I'm more interested in making sure that the whole value chain within our stakeholders participate in this and understands the side of it, because we cannot do it on our own.

29:48 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  And that is more important for us. So in terms of kind of next steps, like what

30:00 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  And what is your timing or your thinking like you've seen this you know we're going to have part of it ready for deployment some of our pilots are like you're going to start with us next month at least trying to do a risk assessment offline so we can get this part so we put it into our tool others are like let's start in February let's we can't do anything now until then like where are you on the spectrum or like yeah others are like I want to do 14,001 summer thing I only want to do 37,001 so where are you on the spectrum of like where we can go next with this for you that would be most helpful.  Our time frame is about 15 years.

  So for us it doesn't really matter we are pressed to use this platform to generate an ISO in one way or the other that's yeah that is not there I am sitting so if we can if we can help you in achieving whatever you're going to achieve with our data I am more than helpful it's up to you to use us.

30:55 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It's any pilot is too wasted it just cannot be that we. and everything from the platform and then here it is.

31:03 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  Yeah. I'm trying to, okay.

31:06 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  But when is your date for 14,001? I'm wondering if we can try to at least automate some of that process for the re-certification, because that might be a natural step.  Then we can also look at 1064 or 68.

31:22 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  It was on my list, the greenhouse gas, but the one just to understand that. I'll drop your line, I just don't have it in front of me.  It will be everybody's time if I start searching my file and says this one.

31:33 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Yeah. No, that's fine. But then we can come back with that, and then I'm just thinking, does it make sense?  Then we set up a call in either early January. I just think right now we're doing, or I guess you guys are designing some things like, it could be actually as you guys design the things that actually show to syringes.  Maybe if you're okay, we're going to have another call in December where the Brazilian team can send you, because there's still a match.  submit an audit that we haven't shown you that they can show you that and we can have like an additional conversation about how it could look in the new year.  could that work?

32:10 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  it looks funny.

32:12 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Okay, yeah, then maybe we'll come back to you with the date. I'll talk to Jean Malcy when the schedules are for those sections and then maybe we'll try to find one in mid-December, maybe in two weeks before the holidays.  Yeah, there. Are there any other comments or anything to say goodbye to Rui or Pinar?

32:30 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  Rui, it was wonderful.

32:33 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)
  I really, really do like your questions. It's just that you make me struggle a lot. My job.

32:49 - surendra khandelwal (Aberdeen Laundry Services)

32:51 - MARTINS Rui (Sopra Steria)
  thank you and I hope I know that you have much more interesting discussions further. with Joao and Mao and Abby.  So we'll also be curious to see what is the outcome.

33:08 - Joao Landeiro - Fortifai Design [Ext]
  I hope our paths to cross at some point in time, somewhere in this field.

33:13 - Abbey Lin (fortifai.co)
  Excellent. Okay. Then we'll come back to you as a surrender of the new time, but thank you so much today.  All right, thank you. Thank you.
