2:19 - A L
  Hello, are you, I'm all right, are you, good, good.

2:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, yesterday, we spoke about priorities. Even it's not coming, right? I don't know. It's a mark that's not. Oh, okay.  Okay, so today's the 27th. On the 25th. We discussed about those, so let me share my screen. Hi, I thought you wanted to come.

3:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  No, for some reason I don't have a link to meet in my calendar. Yeah, there's something weird with the link on the calendar.

3:21 - A L
  It disappears and then you need to import it and then you need to go back. I've been late a few months and I'm trying to, there's something weird.  I managed to find it manually through browser history basically.

3:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, exactly. I had to go back to like old meetings and be like, where's the meeting link from this one?

3:36 - A L
  That's something happened with it. I don't know. The meeting link is not in any of the... Just maybe add the description of the meeting if you can.

3:44 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, it is, but you have to import it. I end up having to import it and then you see the link and then see that.  Yeah, something's weird there.

3:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so I didn't... Let's see if it shows up in the description. Got it. So a bit lost, sorry.  In terms of the development work, are we holding you guys back on anything? to start from? No. No. OK.

4:20 - A L
  What would be like, yeah, I guess Romeo working on the new kind of compliance that we were talking about, we'd update the policy.  Yeah. No, I think we need to figure out how we're proceeding. I spoke a little bit with Mal, briefly when he was on the car trying to figure out.  we try to have another sync on it. We did have a meeting with one of our pilots. Yvonne was in it too.  Just kind of giving, they're the first company we kind of propose the SME to. So it was very interesting to see how they reacted.  I don't know, Yvonne, what were your thoughts? Well, it's based on.

5:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  team reacted very well, my question is today, I didn't understand that part about stocks or not, but it seems to me that like it's a bit now in between their VSME company or more like CSRD company, so that's a bit.  Yeah, so it was like if they are then that's good, yeah.

5:16 - A L
  Yeah, so I think they are very they like when they first heard it, they're like, yes, yes, let me thank God, like your platform like seemed too complicated for us, we're really happy to go even simpler.  But then it is true that like I forgot like, and I should have caught this because Tommy that like they for some reason they should be a small medium sized company like in Norway, you have like registration on your company AS meaning like fortify AS, but they register themselves as ASA meaning that they could list if they wanted to like to prepare for listing, but they haven't listed and they don't plan on the listing.  So it's just like, I think they wanted probably access to different financial assets, but like he said in the meeting, he's like, I can go down to AS in two weeks if we wanted, they're kind of in between there.  So the thing is, if they for an ASA, like according to what I read in the regulation, they have to actually do CSRD because they're listed as kind of like a stock listed company in that entity frame.  But I'm gonna go back with EY and check if they're an OSSA but not actually listed on the stock because they never actually, they're not holding people's money and stuff.  Do they still have to do CSRD just because they have the ASA on their back or can they fall under the SME thing, which is what they would much prefer to be able to do that.  I think, and I think also if we were to go back, I'm gonna check with EY because we're working with them on a project.  If they do have to do CSRD, it would be in two years because it wouldn't be in this first wave as part of the OSSA one.  the same time, like I would say, like I would tell them this, unless there's like a compelling reason, just change your association to AS so you don't have all these additional.  Yeah, exactly. And that would be good for us also.

6:54 - Ivan Ćelić
  They can do it for us.

6:56 - A L
  Yeah, but then they also said that, I also said, like if you're not gonna do BSN, me like I mean if you're not going to do CSRD for two years um it's uh you should probably still do BSME in the meantime because you're getting questionnaires you're getting you're trying to go for tender if you're going different things so in the they also said yes but in in short they seem actually quite positive and we're actually very happy um about like the simplification part of it.

7:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I doubt anyone will have anything uh anything against having simplified exactly I'm feeling like they're they're they're they're all gonna be like sweet we don't have to do as much as kind of yeah exactly yeah last time we spent for them is victory for them so yeah and probably for us too yeah exactly yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense I think that there's a good asset test on whether a strategy is useful which is would the opposite strategy make sense so if I'm a politician and I  I promise clean water for everyone that's not a good strategy because the opposite is not an option. So I agree like people will always want simplification so it's it's not a bad sign but it's still a weak signal that's what we're doing is what they want right.  They're doing the right thing and they're doing the thing right. So do they want simplification for sure yes they will always want simplification so and these conversations are good to explore in which ways would it be simpler right for them.  Not the things that we already know right I'm printing out the the yes I mean as basically so I'm going to read it this afternoon so these conversations when they say yes we want simplification that's very good yeah it's interesting if you can get them to

9:00 - A L
  to tell us a little bit more on what's hard right now or yeah and we we are kind of like I kind of like poked a little bit like I don't not I didn't ask like what hard but I said now we have to reset and we need to actually go through and I kind of showed them the compliance map and said like you know these are the mandatory points and we actually need to go through them with it and ideally we can go through it like you know every week every two weeks we go through one point our pilots you know and and then you we do it manually for you and then you see and you give us input on you know what what to do and what what is needed and then they seem kind of open to the idea of participating in it but then also they said like I want to actually better under I would like to have a framework for you first so we understand like like I had how did he say it even like Mara Mehta was like I would I think it'd be good to have a framework first and then kind of do that rather than come open like and just like you know do a like you know be one what do you do he was like well first come with an idea and  We can kind of discuss it is what she was saying, like, because actually, like, I don't know what I don't know, like, in that sense.  So that was kind of so they're they're willing to kind of sit down with us. But they want us to take a first kind of step at it and then like understanding of what that is.  And then they can kind of say, like, OK, can we get this information or would we get this information?  How would it work? But they seemed right, even like that's I'm trying to I'm going through my notes.

10:26 - Ivan Ćelić
  I feel like I need get like a note taker, like a Phantom note taker or a yes, especially for this feedback meetings.  Yeah, we need to get one of those.

10:38 - A L
  Yeah.

10:39 - Ivan Ćelić
  But I don't remember the but yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, we were discussing the framework and. Yeah, I don't I don't remember her saying that exactly, but that's how I understood it.  That's how I understand what you did to my that was my that's what I'm left with in my head.  But I don't remember exactly her saying that we need to. framework than this one. Yeah, I it is.

11:02 - A L
  You say like, we have to come with an initial like, and I just like, you guys should do some work first is what kind of like, remember that she said, because like, you know, like you guys have the opinion kind of that's like, that's said.  But in general, they seem like open. They're happy to participate. They're happy for us. I think happy as for us to do it manually first and figuring out before we build the platform that we would just do it manually for them.  So they're they're fine with that. And I anticipate all of our pilots being the same way, to be honest.  But they but they understood the SME and they're excited that like, they wouldn't have multiple questionnaires and they're like, this is the way that it should go.  And this is like, like this and make sense. so so that. But yeah, we haven't like, but they're happy to participate in these like product discovery calls and things.  Yeah. Okay.

11:52 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, that's good. And when you think about framework, I when you say that there's something that comes to my mind, what  What do you guys that were in the call what what did you envision that they mean when they say we want to see a framework before we agree to this?

12:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  Well, I think they meant like framework like set of set of rules. I'm not sure how to I'm not sure how to best describe it, but like a set of rules or set of procedures or something like that.  To that you need to follow to to to complete this whole understood framework part. That's that's what's for kids to me.  So when someone says framework to me, it's like a Like a set of rules or set of standards that you follow to achieve something That's how I understood it.

12:47 - A L
  Yeah Yeah, I think it was like there because like I was kind of like this is so new we're still trying to figure out We understand these monetary steps but we need to understand kind of what that means and like, you know Can we you know build that with you and then they're kind of like, yes, that's great

13:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  but then later on she's like kind of I think she was kind of hinting that you guys like should come with something first no I understand that I think that's what she meant by frameworks like under come with what you think it should be first I think they also wanted to have I think they will also take a look at it themselves you saw that he asked you for the presentation probably to take it in and see for themselves what's what's it about so okay so my assumption from the outside is it's a it's a little bit like second consulting right people want to see like what can I expect from this are these like five meetings to our meetings are what are the outcome so in my mind when I hear you guys describe this in my mind they ask and they ask about the framework is a plan is a plan on how to do this thing even if manually right and I wanted to check this with you because I think that's a good thing to ask and that's a good thing for us because it's something with that it's within the realm of the things we know how to do right now we  to make consulting proposals immediately. And if we get them to participate, we could get a lot of insight on how to run this, and then later, how to digitalize this, right?  if this reading is correct, what they would like as a framework is kind of a plan on how we would do it with them, I think that that's good.  And I think that also alleviates some of the pressure for having conversations based on the product. Like we could have different kinds of conversations.  And that conversation is a conversation about how to implement VSME that for this stage doesn't need a lot of screens and stuff like that.

14:52 - A L
  Yeah, I think it's kind of maybe both because I already told them I think we want to do one.  I told them you guys are the first ones. with like talking to we're talking with the rest of because we already had this meeting plea pre-planned and then the other ones were meeting that speak and like you know we're looking at different ideas in terms of whether or not it's like one meeting every two weeks and then we kind of go through each of the different standard like if it's the different standard point so I kind of already mentioned that and then and then they're like yeah this is that makes sense I like that and then the conversation about the framework came so it wasn't like and I feel like that was more about like okay that's great we agree like to these ones one meeting or whatever but when we have these one like one meeting every two weeks then you guys need to come with something first like like having an understanding of that when you come to us rather than like discovering it together kind of a thing so that's that's how I kind of read it but I don't know even yeah more or less the same you're yeah they just don't yeah so basically they don't want to schedule a bunch of meetings that we use to figure things out right they want us to arrive with an opinion

16:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so make sense. will, you know, read the documentation, translate the documentation into a series of steps.  these steps, I might suggest it's like a one-pager text only. This is what our opinion of this, this is how we would do it, this is what we think we'll have at the end.

16:22 - A L
  Could you help collect information and see if you can get it in-house and like, you know, how would you collect this information?  If we said to you, we need this, like how would you go about doing it? And so we can also see their understanding.  I've asked Brighton to start mapping out, because she started doing a few things, like to get a one-note, and in each of the one-notes, each of like, you know, V1, V2, V3 on like one tab each, and then to have like both the explanation and then kind of the calculations so that we have everything in one, start breaking it down there.  So that can be like a starting point and also, and then we can take a stab and we're like, how would you like build this into a software?

17:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  something I don't know and then I would suggest a listlet maybe that's maybe not for them exactly but some kind of easily digestible material that people can read on vSME especially on these small and medium companies I don't expect people to know a lot like same like we did initially they don't know a lot about vSME so maybe we could prepare to prepare them for for like in month or two advance so we can try to push for some kind of small pdf or something visual but simple to digest so that they understand it better why they need who they who is it for yeah I think we're like starting to I know I totally agree with you because I also think that's a good marketing and to also get more customers into into our like interest and like whatever if we have a landing page and then being like hey and I could promote it on LinkedIn or different things and like you want to know more about vSME you want every one peter on it like we could definitely do that and then get more people and then as part of that process if you go do you want to join in that similar like journey usually usually how it's done you ask their email and then you  them a little PDF on their email. that can be done when someone needs something from your resilience. So that's a bit here we need to see.  either way, I think that would be a good thing to have to promote and spread the word. Yeah.

18:17 - A L
  No, I think that, like I'm trying to get my head around this and then to try to create some material around this topic.  So then, yeah, we can use that as like also getting people to see who's interested or also in our sales calls with like being like, hey, can you participate in this discovery call and then we'll give you a one pager and like what you need to do or something like that to like, I think there's definitely movement around that that we can do also to drive to the website page and stuff.  So I think yeah, so just collecting the information right now and putting it together and then trying to get over like that hurdle.  I'm trying to do all this stuff.

19:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in that sense, there's a lot of moving parts on that, right? We know exactly, like after this conversation we're having right now, do we know exactly what we need to do as in a line on a task list?

19:22 - A L
  I think it's a little bit also what do we can agree, like what is our premise, right? Things are changing over time, our pilots are super laid back, this is the challenge, right?  They're like, yeah, because a lot of them are nice and a lot of this is not urgent for them, right?  They're like, yes, I know I need to do this, but it's not like I need to do this by a certain time, so I need you to get going.  And we're doing it for free for them right now as things change. So they're like, yeah, I'll help out, I'll show up, do this.  So it's like if we come with a plan, being like, okay, every two weeks starting like June is this time, this is this time, there's eight things.  Do you want to join our every two week boot camp like then then we are like this is how we think about it And then they come back and be like yes or no because this is too much work for me like or you know like we I think I Think some of our challenges.  They're so nice. So they don't have really strong opinions. So then there's like, yeah I'll do this. Yeah, I'll do this But then if we kind of come in and be like, are you willing to commit six weeks into this some of them might be like, oh, this is You know, they have zero buying Currents and they have like almost zero buying.

20:33 - Ivan Ćelić
  It's a couple of meetings here and there with you Abby and say yes But no two questions and the giving feedbacks.  Of course, I would also do it's not a problem. I mean, that's good You're gonna start asking more.

20:45 - A L
  Yeah, exactly the questions when I start asking more and then there'd be like, I don't know but if we do it in a framework being like Vsma you're getting it for free for this time period.  We need this and like kind of like Push them in they might do it or we might lose them  I don't know, but it's kind of the... But okay, so just a question.

21:04 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So these current pilots, they were selected at a different stage of the premises, right, who were aiming at different things and they have different...  A partially.

21:16 - A L
  Like, I was selling a simplified sustainability solution without a simplified sustainability solution. So the premise of a simplified sustainability solution, I never, even if you look at our pilot agreement, it's just like ESG's solution.  It doesn't say, like, it doesn't say, like, exactly... I understand.

21:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  To the point of nobody will ever want a complex ESG solution, the fact that it was simple, simple in their terms, right?  But what's simple for Acura Horizon is not what's simple for some small marketing agency that works on a co-working, right?  They are very different kinds of simple. So maybe a way of getting a massive interest quickly is to try to find and I think that's kind of what I was going to do with the Chamber of Commerce is try to find groups of SMEs that's like guys this thing is coming up we are developing a method you guys want to join in we are figuring something out but this is our basic working theory of that we will meet every week one hour or two and we'll work together for that you want to do this because if you get and there's like a there's churn on this like 10 companies start but maybe two finish for sure and but these would shift the conversation in not trying to convince guys that they exist in a different context like the big company context to want to do VSME and say it's two years but it's going to be good it's difficult conversation especially if they're nice they will not outright deny it but they won't be committed right but maybe if we can find some companies and we don't need that many because there's a lot of small companies  that are like, yeah, I want to do this. They have the buying to participate in this process, right? And they'll give us insight on what's their life like.  So right now we have this thing, which is a little bit of, it's kind of an easy way, which is we already have the emails and the relationship to these big guys, right?  But if they are not exactly the people that have the information we need, we should look for the people that have the information we need, right?  And I suspect that it's relatively easy to find, especially with the interns and so on. You can find maybe 10 companies to join you on this, but VSME readiness, but can just be very open.  We are trying to figure out to do this. We are at the tip of the spear. Nobody has done this before or open to that and they're interested in that.

23:51 - Ivan Ćelić
  But I'm interested, what do we actually need from that? I mean, let's imagine you know SMEs and you know SMEs, they won't care or won't to make  about this. So how I see it is what we'll need from them is after we do our initial research and of course after we understand what's actually the SME what's required so I think the key here will be is this good enough for you is this fast enough for you is this simple enough for you because how I see it is that we'll need feedback so everything's also that I agree with we'll need X companies that will give them that but I have a feeling that they won't be as opinionated our previous pilots were because previous pilots were opinionated because of obvious reasons they're not okay yeah and I think that's like that's what I'm saying it's like I don't I agree we can get more people we can do that but like and this is what I was saying yesterday like we have like half and half of our pilot customers right and and I kind of purposely like and if you look at like going this hand was always like the small medium-sized companies that don't have sustainability compliance officers that had always been my target in terms of like when I

25:00 - A L
  But I had to start with the large ones because those are my contacts and I'm slightly going down to smaller larger contacts and then using the credibility of these large companies to get these one here, right?  And as I said to my, like my investor yesterday, there's a big chance in the VSME process, we will lose these big customers, a lot of them being in the corporate VC that invested in us, right?  And then you still have the companies like the one that we met with then, you know, Cognite, Zenetta, like Ardoch, like Strice, know, like Startup Lab, a lot of these are still the same ones that you would find in the Chamber of Commerce or these other small ones, they don't have the resources and the knowledge to be able to implement.  I understand. But we will likely already lose these and I'm going to talk with them unless we decide they come from the large company portion, like they need to ask the VSMEs for information, then like what kind of tool would help them in terms of getting the information they need from, like using VSME as a questionnaire.  So I think that... I don't think we're that off like I feel like it's not like we don't have our client base of that We actually want to target.  We actually have some pretty good ones that are about 200 employees, you know 250 300 employees not super large companies in there, so I think We're not that Far off there and we can just build on that.

26:20 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so these Still So understood understood. This is not new information. I'm aware of this So my point is if we are going to digitalize the process of running vs me Because you have experience on running more complex processes.  This is not a complete Unknown we have a feeling of what this entails, right? It's probably a simpler version of other things with them.  That is true But it's a new process is a new process for everyone like we've never done it. They've never done it.  Nobody has ever done it if we test out this process with smaller companies before we turn it into software.  We can turn it into software at a level that we, oh, OK. This is something we just by looking at the documentation we didn't realize, right?  Because we don't know what we don't know. And one of the things we don't know is how to do VSME precisely.  We think we know, and there's aspects of it that are probably obvious. But the decision of transforming it into software is a decision that it gets harder to revert the more software developed, right?  So if we do this with these clients, we will learn from them. That is true. That has been my core argument for that.  But we will also learn about, oh, people always trip up on this question. We need more explanation on this question.  Or, oh, how do you solve this? How do you find this information? How do you find it there? OK, that's interesting, you know, these kind of things.  So my point, I think my core point information on them, but I understand your arguments that we are not completely in the park on that.  We have some information that's good, but we also need some information on the process that nobody, no one in the world has run.  There's no one we can go with.

28:16 - A L
  Yeah, that we can ask them about the new process, is my point. like we don't need, we can bring in, we can start with our existing, you know, the ones that still fit within our ICP and then ask them.  But do they want to do it?

28:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What? We were discussing that they don't have buy-in, right? They don't have buy-in.

28:37 - A L
  Because they're nice and they just want to participate and they're fine with it, but... We haven't proposed anything to them yet, right?  that's like, like Marta from the last one, she was like, oh yeah, I think once a week meeting, that should be good.  Immediately said, yes. Yeah, I she's like, I can participate in that. That's fine. So I do think we have, we can get buy-in into them.  It's just more like... What what does it entail right is it gonna like I don't think necessarily we have buy-in it would be like we need 50% Of your time for the next six weeks to help us build this I don't think we have buy-in for that I think we definitely have buy-in for one hour meeting every two weeks to kind of get their feedback on that I can you think we get buy-in on that so I think it's more like They are agreed as part of this pilot to give input.  They've signed an agreement that they'll help us develop this and that so I think it's more You we can engage them absolutely more and set some more expectations.  I think it's just like we have the balance of like Yeah, I think one hour every two weeks or two hours every like we just have to think about what that is and then propose it to them and say like You know, yeah, you're gonna be overwhelmed like I you know, I can't participate in this Some some might some some but I think I would say I would split it into two pages first pages for us to understand what what Processing and how the process looks like and then the second phase is to get feedback from them on the process we

30:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  other than that we created and that's like a very simplified version but visually do that with them.

30:05 - A L
  Yeah and I think then I think we're all in agreement that we don't develop until we figure out what we do like and we said that like you know we'll do it manually with you before we develop it and they're like yeah that's fine like they are cool with that too so but I agree we should get more but if I think it's like time is of the essence so it's like also I think it's fine for now for now is this are the friendlier ones and then we can expand more once we have the product or advanced prototypes or something that people can click on and see and this one this is I think fine yeah but can get them yeah go on keep them no sorry sorry no I just I think we can still like try to gather people in with the nhh and try to like we could do a second wave of like new people and then like we test it but my point is like time is of the essence so like if it takes weeks to get those new people then I don't want to wait like we have five ones that we can start with now and then like bring in new ones on another one like like  like everybody is now like working on this so it is kind of like speed to understandings like that will be of our that will be helpful so that we can like understand what we like to use April to really kind of understand what we need and to start getting some feedback that would be would be good.  Do you think they will have opinions on VSME because my expectation is that they don't know anything about it and I think it's more like I want to get buy in that they're not going to just leave us and go to another like the SME competitor you know like that's gonna cover them is that they're gonna stay with us to help build this and then at the same time because they they have a contract that they're gonna pay money after the thing like so I want them to be like okay instead of you know when you will join us for VSME and we have VSME ready it will convert to a paying contract because it's pretty much the same thing whether it's ISO or VSME.  kind of like the thing is that you're going to get what you want which is sustainability reporting for free at a like a good cost in that.  And I might need to adjust some of the cost to match like you know what is in the kind of the report but like that's kind of the goal.  And then also like I think like I think VSME is a little bit easier because it's like B2 this is what we need right where it's like and then you can go and very be directly I want feedback on B2 how you collect this information or like that whereas our current product is like controls and then policies for this train it's like harder to get like immediate feedback or specific feedbacks like oh you can't give feedback on controls until you've actually seen it then you understand how it actually comes with the dashboard here whereas like VSME is like B2 requires you to do this like where do you find this information how do you find it does this make sense to you know it's a little bit easier to get their feedback before could it so blatant like it's like you read over VSME this  is like what we require from you, know, like, this is an Abby's head about controls and how it links to dashboards.  It's a it's a little bit easier to have a way to engage them and the feedback before we design it.  I think so I think that's also a good opportunity.

33:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, okay. Perfect. So right now, the first thing we need to do is to convert the guidelines into a plan of how to work with clients to get them to VSME.  Is that it?

33:33 - A L
  Yeah, I think so as I want to understand what VSME is and then and then yeah, how would we engage?  How do they engage our customers to get the right feedback that we would need to build the right product, I guess.  Okay.

33:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Can you repeat?

33:52 - A L
  I guess how do we engage our customers to ensure that we build the right product? them. Because one is we need to understand the requirements so we have the requirements are the minimum that we need to build but the question is how do we build it in a way that makes it easy for them to be able to like easiest in the quickest way to be able to feed these minimum standards right so it's like you have to know the minimum standards so if they go like oh we don't need this and we go no actually according to the standard you need to do it this way like okay you need to do it this way so we need to tell you you need to do this way but in essence in your reality of it like how would you do this in your in your way to get this information to meet this minimum requirement so they're not saying like oh we would just do this it's like well then that wouldn't meet the minimum requirement so kind of going in that and trying to see what is the fastest way to do that okay so that's

35:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we need to create a plan for that, right? Maybe that's the same plan. This is the same thing, right?  one.

35:18 - A L
  I, yeah, create a plan on how, I think it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of the...

35:25 - Ivan Ćelić
  I don't think we will collect user information until we have something to show. I think that's how it is, because we need to understand the DSME, that's definitely the first part.  Then we need to do, produce something that's showcaseable to the end users, like pilot customers. That needs to be visual for sure.  If we come up with a huge document, that will be a bit of a footprint, at least in my opinion.  We can try, maybe people are used to that, but still. And then we can get their feedback from there.  But to be honest, I would maybe try to... So I would actually... how I would do it. At least this is just suggestion.  We just do our process and we just tag them along, not pretend but just have a meeting. You can talk to them and say let's have a meeting every two weeks, one hour and there we can just listen to their demands or to present them something or talk with them about the process just to keep them in case.  we are doing our own thing and our thing would be our own thing would be doing the what's VSME, how does it translate to an app and how does it look like and then we build prototypes and then in a couple of weeks a month or whatever we have a prototype that's clickable and that's showcaseable to them.  Okay, look, this is what we build. This is how it will look to you when you will have the app and then we can get the feedback that we need actually because other than that it will be hard to tell them oh, is it okay for you to upload a file here or would you like to have a bulk upload of files or like that?  Oh, I'd say maybe that's the best scenario for us. Yeah, maybe Figma prototype or something like that as I said, I think that would be the best The best way to show it to people, but we won't be able to have it until at least couple of weeks We need to understand the The whole process we need to build it so it will take time to build the prototypes But until then we could keep them in which we have these meetings that you suggest like let's have a one-hour meeting With them just to keep the the line going just to keep the box going so that they're in in it like you suggested So basically the goal is to keep them keep them in the process and we could maybe share share our findings So for example in a week in one week time, maybe you will we will all have more information via semi That's the right and then in the next meeting with for example these today's oh my god I forgot the name but Thomas Yeah, yeah So you will have more friend then you can maybe pretend to them what's we a semi or so on just to keep them in The process and that way they will learn more about we SME they will stay engaged with us.  They will see that we are in the process and then after after we have something visual we can show it to them and ask them real feedback which would be does this look okay to be something you would use and then of course once we start building the app once we start building something then we can include them in testing same way we did basically with this previous software something like that yeah i kind of like it's a suggestion i think it's a very good suggestion yeah i think part of me it feels like it could be better that we just do it manually like we understand each section and like do it manually manually and then like and then and then once we get like then we kind of digitalize the manual process but at the same time how much time do you think i know you don't know but what's your gut feeling on this what do you think this will take for example you go and take to mn and thank you to his company and how much time do you think it would take for you to do vs me

39:00 - A L
  if you know gut feeling like I don't like I don't know that's why we need to dig in what bsme is right some of them I think it's very short because you need to write just like this and we have already done others I do think AI can come in and just like make something up so I don't know we need to look at each one I think it'll be different but I do think that like it could be like almost like a consulting is like okay this is what we need to do for via like I will be like your collector of information Tommy you know like according to BSA you know we need for to do b2 we need to have your scope of this this and this and this you know like can you just give me your invoices you know or like like and then and then and then like have like some agreement of like you know uploading it is that the best way or like where I think a lot of it is like if you think about what is it what is the easiest thing for a startup like or for a small company is actually not doing like what is  Minimum thing that they need to do can they just get away with giving us an invoice and then we can answer all of their scope Three is there a minimum that they can do in terms of what?  Documentation would they need that we can take over and just kind fix it for them as consultants And how would we fix it for them as consultants and then have technology eventually take over this annual process if that's even possible you know and then and then do that because I feel like even like Like I think about like our scope one and two or you kind of got to go in and then answer these questions And then do this and do that that's great But I feel like AI really like if you train the AI and you kind of give them the like understanding of the document They should just be able to make the calculation and put in rather than having them go through a checklist And like they're all of these questions like you know manually in there because I could just picture Tommy being like You know like that's like if yes, it's better than what they would have to You know like it's probably cheaper than what they would have to do But they'd rather hand it to somebody and just have it done and then move on like And then they do

41:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  That's fine. I'm just worried about the time efficiency there. That's basically biggest concern. If we have time, I would say that's a good plan.  And I think that would be like perfect way to get them on board. would help them get VSME. You will help them collect information.  It's a great process. But I'm not sure if we have time, enough time for you to do that with all our pilots, at least the half of them that's in the Yeah.

41:23 - A L
  I'm like, how quickly can we get an understanding of what VSME, what we would need to collect, that you can almost even, instead of one every two weeks, it's like, okay, for one day, we're just going to work with you.  We need this, this, this information, like how easy for you to get.

41:38 - Ivan Ćelić
  And then maybe we just condense it.

41:39 - A L
  then we don't, we only need you one time a month for two hours, we just go through these six points and tell us where you're going to get this information or whatever.  And we try to calculate with you, and then come back with a drawing, two, like, you know, whatever, like, could this work?  I don't know. I think it's hard because we haven't taken to like, so it might make more sense that I think we have a meeting on Monday night and maybe it could be  The event that you participate in it, but it's just like kind of going through the guidelines and then we Like having a look at it.  I was going to have a look at it and then see like How easy is it doing? Maybe we don't need to engage.  Maybe it's so clear that like We cannot release already figure out through the vsm e document. What is required that we you know And I think it's customers.

42:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah in the old process when the demands were more What was the hardest thing usually I would assume that these people don't not knowing where the information is right Maybe there's information.  Maybe there isn't maybe it's in somebody's email. Maybe that person left the company. I would assume that um A form that has a thousand questions and a form that has 10 questions of the same kind Is the same sort of difficulty, right?  So One is harder for sure. It takes more effort, but it's the same type of difficulty So what do do we have and we can look at the documentation?  we will look, as I said, I'm printing it, so that's a made decision. We will have that.

43:05 - A L
  I think the difficulty, what the difficulty is, is that they don't know what they don't know, and they don't know what it means.  And this is why I'm actually excited about VSMA, because there's actually a document. Like, you know, why we haven't been able to get feedback, because it has been a lot in my head, and a lot in this ISO framework, which they didn't understand, and they haven't read the ISO documentation, and the ISO documentation is not as clear as VSMA.  It's like, you have to have an environmental management system. It doesn't tell you what you need to do and what you need to calculate, right?  So, that was one of their problems, is like, they couldn't give much feedback. Like, so I would be like, okay, we're building the controls part of our tool, and then we're going to check the conflict of interest.  We're going to check that and that. But they didn't have, like, other than the ones who knew what I was talking about, the other ones were like, yeah, that sounds good.  Yeah. I think I need to see it to better understand what that really means. But yeah, controls are good like they couldn't really understand what they were doing until we have to build it for them and show it so then they can test it out to see if they could like actually understand it, which is not, I think, a good process because then we are building it before they truly understand it.  Whereas now with BSME it's a lot easier because there's a standard that can fall back to and it's very consistent.

44:31 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, there's something wrong with my thing. I keep freezing. We can figure all the time.

44:38 - A L
  I think that, so I think that was like in the challenge with our current customers. was like, it wasn't so concrete.  It wasn't like B2. I'm going to teach you ISO 140001 clause.

44:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, I understand. My point is even the PDCA cycle, it's a structure, backbone that appeals more to people that are experienced.  right and the people that are not experienced they're like yeah sure I don't know this seems serious but I don't know how to do this right and this is a perfect example of to to drive adoption we need to do things that fit into the way people think about them right so if we need them to think in the new way and then do the thing it's harder so I think that Ivan's suggestion was very good and I think that instead of asking a we are about to enter this new stage do you want to be part of it we just keep having the same we just add more invites right but we don't tell them that we are now in a new research effort something like we just we're trying a new thing a simple conversation to have even I think that's what you said correct me if I didn't just something like that yeah keep keep doing it with them we are now nothing we won't say that we are pivoting or we can't say it's fine we are now doing this vsmv approach we are discovering and this

46:00 - Ivan Ćelić
  what we found out you will need this is something for you we can also help them understand because they probably all I mean Abby took you some time to understand that they will definitely need more time or won't even care at all to read through this and me as a company owner I would it would be good to hear from someone what we need if you if I come on a call with you then my question should be what do I need how much time will it take and what's it and we can maybe go through that process with them and buy us some time buy ourselves some time to get some something visual out in like a couple of weeks or a month and then we can show to them something visual like this is how the application would look like to what we talked about we now have application for this and let's and what do you think about this this makes sense to you now once you've been through the process and now you see the the visual part of it yeah yeah and even that video I mean it clients if you show them like super Polish stuff they they don't give feedback

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  because I think it's done and they don't want to disappoint you. So we can do that kind of quickly and just, hey, we thought about this, maybe a window with a box and you upload the documents, it's good.  Yeah, it's good. So that process doesn't have to be, doesn't have to take so long because the most time that we that we lose is not so much that the things we are creating are too complex, is that we do them and then we learn something and then we go back.  So if you validate these things the way Ivan described very quickly with clients, I think you can get, you know, faster and with more certainty.  So I think we are kind of agreeing. It's just what what I think. How quickly can we go, right?

47:42 - A L
  is it like then is it every week we have 30-minute meetings with the customers? You know, and I think they would all agree to like a 30-minute meeting like or like a one-hour meeting every two weeks.  Is that what we're agreeing to or are we?

47:56 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, I would say yes, but just with a small offset maybe. Yeah, so I would say yes, but with a small offset of a week or two, just to give us a little bit of time to get ahead of this, to understand the process and get started with it.  So something like that sounds good to me, but yeah. I'm meeting with them next week and next week, we're not going to start getting it, it's more getting there.  Yeah, but you will, exactly, exactly.

48:27 - A L
  So then start, you know, like we start on the week of April 7th and just saying, right then, we'll have like, half our meetings with you, like, but then that, you know, that means next week we would need to kind of get a hold of a VSME.

48:41 - Ivan Ćelić
  Maybe best to give us another week, if possible, if that's not too much of a gap between meetings. If you say whatever week is next, after 17, 14th of April, whatever, then that will give you enough time to, like, two weeks, two full weeks to understand.

49:00 - A L
  we would have a better understanding of all of the SME, or is it better to do like one week and we're kind of in between that?

49:06 - Ivan Ćelić
  Well, we can have the first weekly meeting on the 14th and then have a week after week. I'm just saying that to give us a week or two time to start to understand the better process and everything, we will for sure have a better understanding.  I just don't know if we'll have understanding of all the process because it's, I don't know the scale of it.  It seems like we'll meet sometime.

49:28 - A L
  Because I think it's like, as long as we get like the first three processes ready, then we can start talking.  That's also fine. Yeah. know, while we're getting the other ones.

49:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, yeah, that's fine. If we can have that until 7th of April, then that's still fine, I think that's good, yeah.

49:44 - A L
  But I wanna, like we can read like, I think, you know, just printing out the standard, Yvonne, it could be good for you, you too, also look at, could send you the one that I printed out with like the highlights with my notes.  Is it in the email? It's in the email, there's another version I have, which is like has highlights. It's on it that I've already made, which I can forward you or put it in the teams that I have made highlights on it being like green.  I think we already have it in our platform. know, yellow is just more information. Red is like, we don't have the information.  Yeah, I saw it in the meeting.

50:18 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

50:19 - A L
  So I think that here I can just, I'm going to put it into my team chat so you can look at that.  then like, then you guys can have a look. I know that Brighton is also looking at kind of making that one note on that, which will have some more like, you know, information.  But I think it's more like, yeah, getting our heads around. It's a, you when we engage them, what information do we want to ask them of it?  how do we get more people interested in this? It would be like the the reason why I thought about this boot camp because this is what Sprintel and Vant to do like they they also have they have kind of like they call it a six week boot camp to ISO 27,001 because they also see that they can't just be totally left alone to like figure it out that is like kind of also motivating the people to actually move ahead and like kind of get compliant.  So we could we could also do that and just say okay I mean like you're going to have to go through this work anyway like you can't automate everything it just more like are they free now to do this work or is it better like yeah later on and yeah so to get their commitment to do it now.

51:37 - Ivan Ćelić
  I think it's crucial yeah it's crucial that we know exactly what they need so that they need to do it twice but I think for pilot customers your plan sounds good to me so once we understand the first couple of such in the VSN stuff we can start discussing with them and telling them what they need from data and we can maybe get some head start on the process there because in parallel with all what we are saying this we need to start doing  you know, how to translate this into application. So then those things need to happen in parallel, in my opinion.

52:06 - A L
  And we can try to regroup more companies in and kind of like reach out to the Chamber of Commerce, I don't think we can charge anything yet.  It's like it, because it's so... I wouldn't... Yeah, I don't think we need them.

52:15 - Ivan Ćelić
  We have five customers that you are in good terms with and we know them. I think that's more than enough for now.  And later, when we have something to test that we don't... It won't require us so many hours of engagement with them.  I'd say let's include the circle of companies. I would divide it with the phases, basically, yeah.

52:34 - A L
  So what do you think? Do you think we need more companies in? Or do you think the five existing ones are enough?  Or what do you...

52:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we can start with the five and maybe the future. think we could start with the five and then it doesn't take much work to have like testing conversations in the meanwhile, while we're talking to this five to maybe think about the next cohort.  But yeah, we can sacrifice for sure.

53:01 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah, okay keeping here I think this differentiate the differentiate this from the standard feedback process that we have for product in that We see me the standard and in that standard.  That's that's the standard Okay, they're probably different ways how you can approach it But it's the standard we have a guideline and what we actually need from our pilots is not To tell us how to do we SME that something that will discover What we need from them is to know if the process that we did is okay for them is is it easy enough for them Is it something that they would embrace and that's what I I think is the crucial thing we'll need from them So we need feedback on that side and also we will need to for the we have two different than groups I have pilot customers, which we need to somehow pull in engage with these things that we mentioned right now So I start with the process manual with them, but for the other groups I would say we don't need that for the future ones for the bigger scope We need to have an app or something that will that they can do themselves  Sangina's feedback through that. That's our differentiators to our faces and groups.

54:08 - A L
  Okay. Yeah, I'm open. So like, but I do think like, yeah, I think when we, when you have a look at BSME, and I think maybe like one like read over BSME, but then I think if we were to start with them, most likely we would start on the mandatory ones.  So there are like certain BSME points that are only mandatory. And actually in the BSME standard, you don't catch that very easily.  I didn't realize that until I looked at another documentation that had the overview of which ones are actually mandatory and which ones are not.  So it's like kind of reading over the whole thing. But like where we would start is probably the mandatory ones.  Because knowing our, knowing everybody, they're only going to do the bare minimum, which is mandatory ones. So those are kind of the ones that we should start with in terms of thinking like how would you collect the information?  from the customers on the mandatory ones. And if you wanna know which mandatory ones you can look on the Figma.  There's also like a little chart I think that we put into the mural that says which ones are mandatory, just so you know.  But I would still read over the whole thing so you get a kind of understanding of the gist of it.  But the mandatory ones are the minimum ones. And those are the ones that we'd probably need to figure out how would we do that?  How would we try to collect information? And those would probably be the first pilot customers doing the minimum of that.  Part of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah.

55:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I'm on the Figma. I'm not sure I have the mandatory.

55:40 - A L
  It's that one with the compliance map that I made, the new compliance map. like that right here. I'm on the Figma, so I'm on the mural.  Oh, on the mural, I thought I copied and pasted it. There's a piece of, on that mural there's there's that chart that has like two things and it goes mandatory, not mandatory, it's not there.  Are you sharing the link or are there?

56:09 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, we are seeing your Google Doc.

56:13 - Ivan Ćelić
  Yeah.

56:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah.

56:18 - A L
  Let's see. It's in back. It, where is it? It's right here. Can you see, follow me here? This is where it is.  mandatory. So like this B1 is mandatory, B3 is mandatory, B6, you know, B7, B8, these are the mandatory ones.  And then for the comprehensive, these are the mandatory ones. So this is like, so like, you know, we went through with the vendor, one of our customers is most likely basis for preparation is pretty straightforward.  Energy and greenhouse gas. This is kind of like our scope one and two, you know, that we haven't really tested on it and water, we haven't really done resource, we haven't really done general work versus super easy.  This one is pretty straightforward. I think this one, they would have to do research on that. Not sure they're going to be super happy about doing that.  So it's not, to me, it's not so much. think C is more like comprehensive one is a little bit more like human rights and policies.  We have that. This one, they're not going to have any of this. This one, they're not going to have any of that.  So, and then there's like a part of energy transition. So it's not that much, I would say, but it's like, especially for the non mandatory ones.  I felt like pollution, air, water and biodiversity were like quite difficult, but then now I see that they're not mandatory.  It might not be, it might not be needed, I would say in that, but it's pretty, I would say simplified in terms of what needs to done.  needs to happen for those. Got it. So there are some like, you know, because like, you know, we have some digital companies, but like Acre Biomarine, there are some companies that have factories.  And if they do have factories, then there's in the standard, it goes, if you have a factory, then you need to do more things like, you know, than that.  So that's kind of like, if we want to keep Acre Biomarine, if we want to keep like some like RU company, then it might be a little bit more for them because they have factories versus the digital companies, but it's laid out in the thing there.

58:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it.

58:34 - A L
  Okay. All right. But yeah, Yvonne, this is just like something that we're doing is trying to map out understanding, you know, what to think.  So still work in progress. yeah. So then I guess, so we have a plan for like Monday, I guess, and then like, what, like you're traveling though, right?  Yeah, I have a project next week.

58:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like all of next week? Or is it No, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, I mean the middle of the next week.

59:07 - A L
  So maybe we could also set up a meeting on Friday then. And then how about the following week? you traveling or do you have other projects?  No, following week is a normal week.

59:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Normal week, okay.

59:22 - A L
  Yeah, so then we could also maybe set up a time on Friday next week to kind of decide. But we have that thing on Monday, so we can do it there.  okay, then is it all good? we kind of have a plan. Yvonne, you read VSME, I'll read VSME, and then I'll read VSME, and then we'll see.  then the focus maybe, I think it could be good to read the whole thing, but like then go back and look at the mandatory ones.  then you, because that's where we would probably start with the customers. It makes sense to start with the mandatory for sure.

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. All right.

1:00:04 - A L
  And then tomorrow we have a meeting. Romeo will come back tomorrow with kind of some of the drawings. that correct?  He's working on the compliance map that like kind of updated. Yeah.

1:00:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. Perfect.

1:00:16 - A L
  Okay. Thank you then. you.

1:00:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye.
