  This meeting is being recorded.

0:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hello.

0:05 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Hi! How great to see you, my friend!

0:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  She's a... It's been a while. How are you?

0:15 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  How am I? I'm good, I'm good. It's been a wild ride. I'll tell you, it's been a wild ride.  How about you?

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't know. It has been interesting. Lots of learning.

0:34 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  But now I'm very intrigued. Because you really put some intention into your answers. When we last met, I was on a contract.  That was like four years of me being on a contract. And so since then, I've wrapped up a contract.  I finished that contract. I started a new one. I've learned... Well, I'm in the process of learning design. which pairs so nicely with the work that you do that it's a bit ridiculous actually.

1:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That group I think selected for that, the school of the possible.

1:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Oh my god. And so yeah because basically that's the invite. Please create like a mini pilot to test an idea or assumption but actually learning design as a skill.  It is very hard by the way.

1:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What do you feel is harder? which part is harder?

1:40 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  So I have done workshops for years right I just made  up but then suddenly when you have insight into or someone being a bit thoughtful slash critical about you know what like the order and it's it's a kind of a facilitator's guide.  Like a train-the-trainer approach versus Yeah, well this makes sense here like in my mind that makes complete sense because I'm running the workshop So I know I can adapt based on where I am And I can take people on whatever journey I want.  So there but it's for someone else and Their requirements You can't do that. They don't let you do that and And it has to make complete and you have to link the things in a certain way But there's no criteria that is obvious.  It's just like a make-and-dance criteria But if you've never done it before in that way And you've done whatever you wanted for as long as you want it and then someone's like, no, that's not right and I'm like But the thing you're designing is It's your design train-the-trainer for other trainers.  Yeah, no other facilitators.

2:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Oh, okay.

2:59 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Okay. Yeah Yeah.

3:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And now, now like doing this for someone else to use it based, I would guess that you need to be more explicit or formal.

3:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Intentional. like, I can, I think things make sense or I'm like, oh, that could link with that thing. No.  No, it doesn't link with that thing, Melissa. It links with the other thing and I, so I think there's another market out there for you.  For people who think they know how to do workshops, but they like it, but they don't. Like you could actually just pivot, like get very super niche on people like me that's like you're really good at workshops.  I would say I'm good at workshops. Like I've had years of practice of doing this, but did you know by doing this one thing you could improve your workshops by, you know, 80% you could  you get 80% more memorable, you could have 20% more referrals and you could have like 50% more fun. , I would buy that.

4:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I would buy that.

4:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Someone could explain the labyrinth of what I've just experienced.

4:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's such a niche thing, right?

4:21 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  But there are so many people out there doing workshops that don't know how to do workshops for real.

4:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that's for sure. That's the fact is like, I don't know if I told you this at the time, like I've done workshops, I've done a lot of workshops, but part of the reason why I try to position myself as these like workshops or consultants is that I didn't want to be, you know, competing with people because workshops have been around for a long time, right?  Some people have been running workshops for much longer than than I have. I know I'm not world-class at workshops and the internet really is hard if you're not...

5:01 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  differentiated in some way.

5:03 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I like, I don't want to try to cling that ladder because there's some very good people like super dedicated working on, don't know, the UN solving difficult negotiations with the workshop.  There's like levels to this and I'm not that one. So I was like, oh, I need to find a place where this is useful, but most people don't know it, right?  And it's so funny, you need to kind of pick your poison, because now I'm finding more people that are like, what's a workshop?  And oh, yeah. Okay, yeah, they don't know. I need to explain what the workshop and sometimes they've been to a workshop, but they didn't they didn't realize that's what it was called.  Yeah, or they went to a thing called a workshop on the paper, but it wasn't more than it was just like a keynote presentation with a quiz or something like that.  So it's it's interesting. But how did this come to be like, so this is a new contract you're doing?

5:59 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, but It's almost over like I've done two modules. One is about emotional intelligence, which is what I needed to learn in order to navigate doing this work.

6:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So the irony is not lost on me.

6:13 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Like I had to learn how to emotionally regulate myself through this. And then the other one is about resolving conflict.  So those two skills, intelligence and, you know, hosting conflict conversations, these are like big things to help people navigate, like it's not easy to help bring awareness to, you know, big emotions.  Right. Like, you know, you've got to have that conversation with someone. You're like, ah, now I got to tell them they're doing kind of a  job at that.  But I.

7:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  that was exactly what I was talking to my wife about a third person before I got on this call.  Like there's a client I'm getting really frustrated with. And I think it starts to see through like in Oh, yeah, that's because you're non verbals are actually, you're actually expressing what is happening very clearly.  Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm expressing that a lot. So, and like, I don't want to have to deal with but I'm also trying to very consciously think about this in like, this is good skill to have.  It's good to have the opportunity to practice this skill. Yeah, it's the mature thing to do. I don't want to do it.  But I'm like, maybe I can frame this as, you know, something good out of it. But I also feel I don't, I don't know if you feel this way about facilitation of these kind of things.  So much of it hinges on, you know, self awareness and, you know, like that.

8:01 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And it's hard to assess that for the person that asks you to do the workshop, but if they don't have that, then in order to have it, maybe they have a different language, like a different love language or, know, maybe that's it, like that's part of actually having that difficult conversation is inviting them in to explore what's happening.  So you can, you can practice empathy, which is what you're trying to do, like care for others. And they can practice self awareness, which is understanding what's happening for them in the context of the situation.  And sometimes actually, when we slow things down and say, I'm noticing certain behaviors, and I'm really curious. about that because something clearly is happening for you that either I'm not able to pick up in the moment or I like there seems to be some some things that are going on under the surface so if I have a better understanding of what that is and if we can meet like I want to invite you into this conversation and these conversations like no one really wants to have this conversation by the way like I don't really want to have this conversation but I care enough like this relationship matters to me to step you're very good at this with you and what I propose is this and you can just frame it like there's a there's a feedback model that you could use called coin  Like, what's the context?

10:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  What did you observe?

10:05 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  look at the coin model and then draft up the coin model in advance of the situation in terms of what your interpretation was of that.

10:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, context, observation, interpretation.

10:20 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Next steps. And so you're actually coming at the end of the coin experience for you, but it's the start of the self-awareness empathy conversation for you both.  Because I think there's also some reflection on not only what are you assuming about their behavior, like, what's the story?

10:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You're making up.

10:53 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  But how could you step into their shoes for a minute and actually ask, get really curious about what other things may be going  going on that I'm not aware of? What other assumptions am I making in their behavior? Other things like power differentials, because in the relationship, if they have hired you, you have, you're probably like me, it's like, I want to do a really great job.  And you have the power to take away funding from me. And so therefore, you have power in this relationship.  And I am the receiver, like, unless I have you have lots of clients. And then it's like, well, I wouldn't care as much about this relationship.  And maybe I'll say, this isn't a fit and we should move on. But what you've indicated, because you're curious is, and by inviting them in, you're saying, this relationship matters to me.  And I care enough about this relationship to be direct, be candid and have candor with you. So Oh, like, not all conversations are like this, but this one matters enough to me that I'm prepared to do some thinking around it.  But think of it like a story. You need to do the thinking first. You need to have a beginning.  But you also have to bring your own self-awareness. Like, what are the triggers for you? Where do you see your emotions landing and all of this?  And you need to own that for yourself before you even activate the next thing. Because you're the second part of the puzzle piece, right?

12:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  For sure. sure. And I mean, this situation is perhaps a little bit more extreme. Streaming the sense that it's really getting on my nerves, but it's not a bad person.  So it's not black and white kind of thing. Like, oh, they're serious. They're an idiot. mean, it's not like that.  It's just some things that really... this has happened before in the past, not exactly this pattern, but me not being able to handle the frustration and letting that show through and then demolishing like that bridge like oh yeah cool I'm glad the work is done let's not never speak again this has happened so it would be better not to oh you're sharing your screen I'm sharing my screen this is just screen cap it why am I feeling right why am I what am I feeling what's driving that emotion what do I want for the conversation for myself and for the other person what do you what's the future vision for that what's their perspective what what my baby feeling thinking how can I regulate my emotions in the situation so it might be like having a big glass of water ready so when you start to feel that thing happen in the pit of your stomach you have a big drink of water
  SCREEN SHARING: Melissa started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Dgxyyzp4UnrzLBBm3MSSEp-wP5iHVzQ2?timestamp=796.321932

14:00 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And you're like, okay, I'm grounded. I'm back in the present. I'm not in the future. I'm not assuming anything right now.  Right? And then how can I approach it with curiosity, not this like, oh, why can't you get this? is it the right time?  Is there other things that are triggering you? So maybe you should just wait. And here's the last point that I was mentioning around the power dynamics.  Like, is there anything that we need to address that may be getting in the way? That we can acknowledge on the way into the conversation.  That's your thinking before you even start to think about what that may be. And maybe also like Google Emotional Rights and techniques.  So when you feel yourself like... You know, acting that you're better able to say, what's the thing that I'm going to do?  I'm going to do some box breathing. Just wait. I'm going to go to the washroom. I'll be right back.  In for, hold for four, pause for four, release for four.

15:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Imagine just pulling out a cigarette. That's so old school.

15:27 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah.

15:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, but this is really useful and very actionable. Like, don't know if, do you mind if I pick up the phone?

15:40 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  ringing.

15:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You'll go ahead. So. Hi. Wife, wife got to it in time. Sorry. Um, so, but this is very. I don't know if I told you when we last spoke, I took like a coaching course or like eight months thing.  It was a lot of time. And I think if we were to sum it up, there's a lot about practicing this really genuine curiosity.  Not like, oh, I have the answers on an eight week level really fast. Otherwise they don't see the value of what I do.  It's like just be very curious. And yeah, I can see like, oh yeah, this all of this is connected.

16:35 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  you are very curious. In fact, I think, you know, perhaps the reframe in this is like, you actually know what you're doing.  You just need to apply the same principles that you apply to other people to yourself. So that self-awareness like why, what's happening right now?  am I feeling so much of whatever this is? What's the actual emotion that I'm feeling? Because the other thing is when we don't have a broad language for emotion, it's like colors, magenta versus pink.

17:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's that meme, right?

17:20 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, exactly.

17:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, there's a book here in translated, I think it would be the emotionary, like the chinary for emotions. I thought it was such a clever term.  But yeah, for sure. And I think, in a sense, I was a little bit stuck with this, I would say that of course, my self-worth is a lot of holes.  But I was like, yeah, I think I know what I'm feeling, but I was just not feeling like that I had the tools.  manage this, right? So this is why I liked so much about, like, this was a very actionable set of tips that you gave me.  And I can see, yeah, yeah, I can, you know, put myself in that frame and go through it, not as a robot, but like, navigating, reading the moss on the tree, like, yeah, this is the way we move.  So I think this was, I mean, Uncanny and Kenny, how timely it was.

18:27 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  No, but this is why we had to connect, because you need to get that checklist. Yeah. Like, I have to spend hours last night to create it.  So last night, because you needed it today. I stayed up late.

18:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's fresh.

18:40 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  And I got it for you for this conversation.

18:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, sorry, there's someone I need to introduce you to, because I think he's a very nice guy as well.  being nerd on developing facilitation for others. I think you will really love, you know, learning with you, learning with you.  His name is Kurt. He's in the state. He's here in Canada, but he's closer, I think, time-wise.

19:23 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  I love an intro.

19:26 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll do that. It's very public. He to me this week. Well, I thought that the half hour could maybe work, but I think it's just a warm-up.

19:38 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Clearly it's a warm-up, but it's okay because it's been so long. I have so many questions for you. okay, the coaching.  And I know we have five minutes left, so it is not the time to ask this question. I'm just...  How are you applying it? What does it look like for you?

19:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  does like... What are the pieces of all of that? um, no, I just took it because I wanted to understand a little bit more of that language, not that I wanted to necessarily put up a shingle.

20:10 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Oh, so you're not planning to coach, you're just wanting to understand it in a different way?

20:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think that this is a kind of relationship that pops up all the time, but we don't realize or we don't know that we're in it.  We don't have like what we just like you gave me tools to handle this thing. And there were aspects of it that I think I felt somewhat naturally inclined to, but never had any sort of formal thing.  And I'm so sorry, the door is ringing right now, it's the food.

20:46 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  You know what, let's just let's just book another time.

20:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, it's good to reconnect. it is.

20:51 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  Yeah, and I'm looking forward to our next one.

20:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Same, same, I'm so sorry for for living this way.

20:58 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  No, no, oh good.

21:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  See you later.

21:01 - Melissa Breker (Melissa Breker)
  See you You got your checklist. That was the thing. I'm done. Out. I did. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
