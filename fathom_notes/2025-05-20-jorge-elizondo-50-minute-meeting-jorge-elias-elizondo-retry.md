0:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Hello sir. Hello.

0:11 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How have you been?

0:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Wait, wait, wait.

0:15 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Hi. How are you? Good.

0:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You? Good to see you.

0:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Every time I see you have a new haircut. I'm trying new things.

0:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Always trying new things. It's been a while. Three months maybe? It's been a while. You also have a new haircut.

0:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. It's just not a haircut. A non-hair haircut.

0:42 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Well, it's just you look different. Different hairstyle. That's the thing.

0:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I should do something about it maybe. But so I think last time we spoke and then you went to Japan and then you came back.  And then we spoke. A bit before we set up this call.

1:05 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I watched your Exotic Matter episode with Nick. It's nice. it did? Thank you. Thank you for that.

1:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll ask for feedback later on. It's so much work to do a podcast. I think I knew, but I didn't at the same time.  Because everybody told me, it's a lot of work. Yeah, sure, but it is a lot of work. But anyway, I'm glad that I did it.  I hope it opens some doors in terms of conversations, inviting people in, stuff like that. So tell me, how can I help you today?

1:44 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, well, I talked to you about helping me get templates for future workshops that I want to do. I was thinking about ideas.  You told me also in the message that we should have a structure. Before. Trying to create this templatized version of the workshop, you know, so I know that the main, the essence of a workshop, it's like opening, emergence, and closing, right?  We need the generation of ideas, like the check-in, and what are we doing here, blah, blah, blah, then the opening, and then the closing, you know, what do we need to evaluate, what are going to decide, next steps, right?  So in that essence, I want to like, how can I create like workshops with the psychedelic preparator or integration in mind?  And I've been playing around and, you know, like more of kind of freestyle kind of things, but I like how you have like a structure, you know, it feels like you have a feel, like, you know, like where you can play, you know, like with sometimes I just get into my role, and we just did one, I'm trying, I'm doing this new type of workshop.  It's a psychedelic-assisted creativity or psychedelic-assisted workshop that it's, you know, taking a microdose or a mini-dose and, you know, creating, like, going through a methodology, you know, like, you know, like, what's the problem?  What do you want to solve? You know, like, obviously, first the checking, how do you come to the space?  What are your plans? How are you feeling? And, know, we connect a bit. And then I actually did that already.  And we started with some ideas of what he wants to solve or the things that he doesn't understand. And then I played with these kind of pip-text cards, know, like, different kind of exercise.  But, you know, I don't, like, I don't have, like, actual boards or things. It's just more of, like, pre-mind mapping in a way.  So, I'm trying to get these building blocks of the exercises. So I can just, you know, like copy and paste the template and, you know, and I don't take a lot of time in designing the template, you know, and with that in time, you know, I know I can play with different exercises, with different frameworks.  Maybe it will be nice for me to have a better idea of the actual exercise that I want to play, but at the end, like this card, know, like the tools and the exercises are limitless, right?  But what I want to have is at least some kind of structure for each exercise where I can, you know, it's going to save me time to change some things.  It's like, as you told me, when we started working together in the worship, that you already have some templates and you just change some things, but it's not taking you as much time as, you know, building it from start to finish, right?  So that's where I'm at. Perfect.

4:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So in my mind... This is a little bit about, well, it's like templates, right? So that you can mix and match, and like after this one, I want this one, put it in.  They are editable, so you can change the time or change the prompt or stuff like that.

5:19 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like modular blocks, right? You know, like maybe with you, I've been like 10 or 8 or I don't know, and now I know like how can I play or how can I do more, but with the same kind of design and things like that, you know?  Got it, got it.

5:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Do you want to show me some of the stuff that you've done that made you think about creating templates and models and stuff like that?

5:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  That's a lot. So, what is this one? I'm going to show you one that I just did with a friend, psychedelic creative, psychedelic assistant workshop, that it's, you know, like, you will see, like, how messy it looks, but it's just to show you, like, I need a structure, you know, I just, I get a thing and I put, this is going to be our game, game zone, you know, like, we're going to do an opening, we're going to stay in the markets to see what ideas are.  You see my screen, right? I see your screen, yes. And then the convergence phase, you know, like, it's when we're going to decide, you know, I have here, first we need to understand the problem, then we need to set the goals, and then we go to the generation of ideas, and then we evaluate, decide, and discuss, you know, like, what are we going to focus on, right?  So, at the beginning, I just, you know, this was more spontaneous, just to try now things, but it was a checking, like, how are you feeling?  And, you know, he is feeling fine, excited. He was with the psychedelic person and he was having a lot of visual effects.  So it's good to have a check in just to see, like, how is he doing at the moment. And then I did an exercise that I just came into my mind, you know, about what are, it's, with this workshop, it was about how can we collaborate and how can this kind of psychedelic assisted workshop can help you.  And we worked with what are my qualities, my talents, and my weaknesses, the same as him. And we started writing that just to see, like, if there's any connections or, like, similarities in values, things like that.  And then we decided to, okay, now we need to formulate, like, from this, what kind of work can we do together, you know?  So we started exploring ideas about, you know, he is a futures thinking innovator and he used to work at Oracle and he likes, you know, future thinking and things like that.  He's the purple ones, and I'm the black one, and I'm more about, you know, maybe we can create a framework or a canvas or explore different creativity tactics, or maybe just how can we develop a creative workshop, you know, and he explained his ideas, and then we decided more like, okay, maybe we could create a consulting firm, right?  And with that, I put my ideas, trying to formulate like, how can we, or how might we, that's like the next one, and then we, I did like kind of, kind of Eisenhower matrix about like, how are, but it's just slightly different about how can we commit better together, and it's going to fill us and excite us, and at the same time, it's going to have an impact, because one of us, value, you know, social impact, so, you know, from this, we decided to put it here and decide what if you  See, you know, there's no structure, and it doesn't look neat, and, you know, like, it's so messy. But then we decided on one, you know, and how might we create a new methodology of psychedelic instruction about the future, you know.  So we decided I'm going to do four prototypes, and you're going to do four prototypes, and, you know, like, what's the name, what's the concept, and what's the description, you know, and, you know, this is the fun part, the emergence part, you know.  So we started doing the different kind of ideas, and he did his ideas, and then I asked him to evaluate my ideas, and I was evaluating his ideas about what are the good aspects, what are the bad aspects, or the negative aspects, and what are the potential opportunities about this prototype.  So it was fun, and we started to understand more about we need to work with a certain emotion, not the actual client, not a profile of a client, but with the actual emotion, and with this, we developed this.  Then we discussed the idea, and I did a light, I wish, I wonder, and the next step. So the next step was, you know, like, I just watched the video with you and Nick about, you know, how can, you know, there's nice ideas in the workshop, right?  There's always an emergence of ideas, and those ideas are really nice. But after the workshop, it's like kind of after the psychedelic experience, people don't do nothing at all.  So I heard about how Nick said, you know, in the university, like, hey, you need to put this in your calendar next week and do it now.  So I was in the next step, you know, like, just schedule this. We're going to explore now one of these methodologies, and we're going to build it as we do it, but schedule four hours to do that.  And this took me like four hours to play, you know, it looks simple, short, but it was, you know, it was kind of four hours.  And then I was developing this kind of, like, Professional integration, kind of the business model new in a way, and the idea is to explain, you know, first we need to know like where are you in your professional career at the moment, why we need to research, why we need to define everything with design thinking in a way, and I was putting this, you know, like this is something that I was playing around, you know, I'm hearing a description of the model, who am I, and with this it's to evaluate the progress each week after.  We do this, it's just, it's not something static, but something that we can go over and over each week, and here I was putting this board that I got from Dave Gray about, you know, how can we, I like how he was checking in on each person each week, and you know, like any needs or desires were, like, were attended, and how is the commitment, and...  There's another kind of framework that I put, you know, to see, like, how are they feeling each day of the week, you like, any problems or anything or any achievements, you know, so we can put it in here.  I haven't tried this, but I was taking the time to building this. So from now, from this kind of work that I did here, that it's more of a workshop and here is more of a follow-up kind of dashboard, I was thinking, you know, like, I really want to have these kind of things because it's, the workshop, it's fun, you know, and actually with the psychedelic, it was fun.  And the guy that I did this, he was really inspired about this kind of dynamic. So I'm like, okay, what if I put more structure into it?  It doesn't have to have, like, this beautiful design as Lucy or your friend Spencer, that they're great and amazing, but I think I don't have that kind of...  Me to develop those kind of scenarios, but maybe just as simple as the ones that you do, that I like them about.  And also I have another, my other friend did...

13:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So before you open this next one, I want to see it, but just before you open that one. So the first example you showed me with that, that was something you did with your friend.  It was a thing to help you, both of you, to figure out a way of collaborating together, right?

13:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. It's like the collaboration canvas sort of thing.

13:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And the second example you showed me, my interpretation is, it's more to work with clients over a period of time, so we can use the same mirror board to check tasks and stuff like that.

13:53 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Is this correct? Yes, would be more of a kind of a dashboard to be more like kind of a success.  Coaching, and the other one is just the first try of trying to do like the, the psychology workshop, and I have something more, you know, let me show you my website.  I have ideas of workshop products that I haven't decided. It's just, I'm doing this. I'm just putting all them together to see what are the best take on it.  What I was doing, you know, in the actual, as a, for business or innovation, you know, some about like, what are the, like, first one is like, what is, what is, what you want to, to, to accomplish, you know, like in, in to see if we can help you in a way.  And this is, this is, maybe this is more easy, but I'm, I'm trying to stay into the, the more expertise of me that it's the psychedelic.  And it's more about, you know, I was thinking, you know, like the healing activation worship that it's kind of, you know, getting the same exercises of the business, but to analyze the person and their problems, you know.  So with the microdose, we do this or maybe a workshop for lifetime, lifetime line to see, like, we need to explore the key moments of your history of life, achievement, crisis, changes.  How can we look at together what kind of ideas are you getting from this and then take it to the next step, you know, like from this, what are the key insights or key learnings from all that you've been through?  Now with these insights, what are the things that you decide that it's going to be important to integrate in your life, that it's going to make a change in how you perceive, how you see yourself and your self-concept, you know, like more into the personal and maybe.

15:57 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Jorge, if the concept is not opening for me. Change? The what?

16:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  New website. Ah, my website. I have a new website. Oh, that's, let me show you my new website. I decided to, at the end, I decided not doing like the actual six-week course, but I was, I decided to do like, it's included, but it's going to be like kind of a integration.  And your retail change as well, or is the same? Jorge, expandiendoconsciencia.com. Yeah, cool.

16:44 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Integration as a service.

16:46 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Well, me show, while you see that, I'm going to search for something also that I have here. Classroom. Hmm.  And I have this, it's called, you know, the Rootmine Workshop Series, where I'm going to do, like, kind of a short workshop for each week, for six weeks, and it's going, the first one is like the clarity code, right?  And with that, I know I need to develop in the structure, the introduction, the scene, how are we going to work that, and then the next steps.  And I was doing here some of, I have some ideas, you know, like the opening 30 minutes, we do maybe a hopes and fears, emotional checking, and then in the versions, the sailboat to charity.  The CSD matrix, certainty, a question that we also, like, put when we... We're doing the project management thing, and then the affinity mapping, and then the Eisenhower mattress, you know, and then next one, it's, you know, like more of doing all other exercises that are going to align them to what they need, what they need, and we want to also drive their commitment.  And I was developing some graphics and some kind of matrixes as well, or frameworks, if we want to call them to help them have more clarity in their decision making, right?  And then we have the dot voting, so they choose which are the actions that they really can do now after the workshop, and, you know, like defining the next step, you know?  And, okay, I have here some of ideas, you know, about the opening, exploring, and closing, and... These are some of the exercises that we have here, and I put to check to, you know, also GameStorm, we have a lot of exercises.  The thing, I have a lot of, there's so many, so many tools and exercises that I haven't tried, that I know there's so many, and with you, it's like, also learning, like, what are the best kind of exercises that you find that are the most, not interesting, but, like, the ones that give better results, like, along all the things that you've done in your life.  right? Like, how can I know, you know, because AG Smart, you know, they have this kind of core framework that it's maybe generate ideas, collect, connect, and decide, you know, these four steps.  And in those four steps, it's open, emergence, and close, you know, the essence of the... ROI. ROI. Thank Or shopping kind of system, way of working.  But they just decided to do some simple exercises. They just always do lighting demos, they do sailboat, they do dot boarding, but that's it, you know, and maybe those are the ones that work the best, you know, but I don't know if those are the ones that work the best, so that's where I'm at.  Okay.

20:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I've started once a blog post with a sentence, a quote from Bruce Lee. He said, I don't fear the guy that has trained a thousand kicks, I fear the guy that has trained one kick a thousand times.  And that's how I think about workshops as well. Like, my exercises are not complex at all, right? But I like to think that there are mechanics, like we...  Understand the mechanics, and we just stack them on top of each other. So I don't have like exuberant exercises usually.  And I think that most of the times exuberant exercises are more a liability than a strong point. Because sometimes people don't understand them, people misunderstand them, which is even worse, because then you need to correct them and pull them back.  back to the origin point. So I have a post on this, but basically, I agree with those rough four, I think, about five families of exercises.  And it's very rare that I look for other things. Sometimes I mix and match things. To give an example, just as an illustration.  So voting is a very simple idea, right? But you can make voting much more that apply Interesting, by creating special votes, or people have veto power, or, you know, stuff like this, or you can vote twice on the same thing.  You can change the rules of voting, but the mechanic of voting remains the same, and just by changing the rules, you get different answers.  So that's a thing. Okay, so here's what I'm hearing, and let me know if this makes sense. So from the Miro perspective, you'd like to have, like, the basic structure that, you know, ties everything together, right?  It feels like an experience that has been structured and designed. But at the same time, if in your sessions you feel that, oh, there's something interesting to explore here, we need to leave the structure that we've designed, it feels to me that that's something you would like, the ability of step.  And I think we need a few basic templates. We need, for sure, a cover that's also useful for the miniature in the mirror and so on.  We need kind of an agenda or program for the session kind of thing. I also like to use, when there's more than one session, a program for a slide that shows all the other sessions, right?  So people understand, oh, okay, so we are in the session two or four, and there's more stuff, but now we'll focus on this, right?  There's a bit of a zooming in and zooming out, right? We need a slide for instructions, and we need slides for content, basic.  next time. So And it's very easy for us to get lost in the slides for content and then buy two columns, three columns, six columns.  And to begin with, I wouldn't do all of those. And I think it's important that we have a final slide that is the one slide that tells people what to do next, that you can export as a PDF, send them, maybe they can print it, you know, connects to the next steps.

24:23 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Like a tangible, something like something, know, like a summary of everything we've done and the next step. Because I was thinking about that, you know, like, okay, they need to have like this reminder or kind of memory or how do you call it?  Like a souvenir of what happened, you know?

24:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  A memento, yeah, yeah. Question. Okay, so from a design perspective or content perspective, this is relatively easy to understand.  Because you have the psychedelic-assisted sessions, we have a new element that is a new thing for me, but I think we can find a way around it, which is there's instructions for people to do things in the real world, right?  Like, okay, now take, I don't know if it's a T, take the thing, we'll initiate the microdosing effect and so on.  So maybe we need that?

25:31 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I'm actually, you know, about the whole thing of psychedelic-assisted worship, and I'm trying to do like kind of, it's also kind of, I don't know if it's a program, but they need to have in my way, like kind of some instructions about what they might expect of, you know, of the field.  So the psychedelic, because it's not just doing a workshop, you know, like just bring your soul and be open mind, you know, they do the psychedelic, it's going to be more.  So I have different. Important things to tell them about that and also about the implications of, you know, what happens if you are doing psychedelics for creativity, you know, the downside is, you know, you're going to have low capacity for logical thought processor, you're going to be going to be lost or not in the hallucinations, not concentrated, but at the end, the good side of doing that for creativity is you're going to have increased access to unconscious data.  You're going to have more ability to see patterns, you know, what I found when I was doing the workshop, you know, we were doing the prototypes, you know, like the things that we want to do, and that what we do in the workshop, it's very superficial, you know, it's, you know, what do we do?  But when you close your eyes and do the creativity, you can see with the mind of the psychedelic, kind of with some more depth, and you see, you know, what is the core?  Around these prototypes, you know, like, what is the essence of this pattern? And the psychedelic, it's helping to get to the essence, you know, like, you know, all of the prototypes is about creating a methodology, you know, it's not a, it's not about the prototype, you know, get to the essence, it's about having the structure.  And when you have this, like the, like, like the nervous system, you can be loved about, you know, so that's the interesting things about psychedelics, you know, you have more hiding empathy also, but what's happening, and how are you feeling around what you're doing, and you feel more connected with the things, you know, so in that kind of instructions, I think it's, it's important to have it, but I think it's before getting into the worship, not the instructors in the worship, right?

27:50 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm. For sure, for sure. There's a feeling that the弱 that an extreme, extreme, at let's Not what I'm proposing for this moment in time, but at an extreme example, it's like a design system for your entire communication, right?  So, cool. Very cool. Okay. I can see in my mind the kind of assets that we need. And can we pick one of these workshop structures that you showed me?  Which one of these is closer to the workshop that you want to offer your clients? So we begin with that one.

28:47 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think it's good if I explain to you a bit so you can help me decide which one is the best one.  Okay, where am I? So I have, I was thinking about names also, you know, the first one is the clarity is, you know, about, you know, like, what am I going to do with what I've seen, you know, so with that, we want to transform the confusion of what they experience in the psychedelics, or maybe they don't know how to handle or manage the experience, and it's, you know, let's get into clarity, and that's what I'm trying, you know, what are your hopes and fears, you know, to identify your expectations.  and fears, know, and how are they feeling right now, so I can understand, like, where are they at the moment, and with the emergence phase explaining, know, like, let's do the sailboat, you know, with the experience, you know, try to, I put the image of the boat, and, you know, now explain, explain to me, you know, like, what are your anchors, what's training you at the moment, what's cause, what, what it's a main concern for you, what is the iceberg, you know, like, what are the things that you are preoccupied  That might happen, that it's not letting you to flow into where you're headed. The sun is like what is nurturing you and how can we nurture yourself more with that.  And what is your island or your treasure, you know, like what are you trying to achieve, you know, and what is favoring you, what are the opportunities that you have around you.  So in a way, this is going to give them clarity to see, okay, this is what it's blocking me, you know.  And when we're in the psych, like micro psychedelics, I can go more in depth into their, into their cell phone and do like, okay, like, but what is the cause of this preoccupation or concern, you know.  So this is just like kind of just a first frame where I can diagnose more the person, but I think it's good.  And maybe also, you know, what are the assumptions, questions or certainties that you have right now, you know, after the experience, you know.  What is something that you're assuming that might happen or that you are, that you don't have the resources to work with it.  What are the questions? So that you have like that you you need answers. So maybe I can help you answer that.  And what is something that you already know? Maybe you already understood that you have a problem with your mother and you need to solve it, but you don't know how.  That's what everybody has a problem. Everybody was has. It's not it's never too late to have a happy childhood.  So everybody has a. And about affinity mapping, you know, about all these. These ideas that you're telling me, or maybe it's not affinity mapping, it's something else.  But it's, know, like, what is the essence of all of these? But, you know, look at it, connect with it, close your eyes, you know, what are this and what are you needing?  You know, what is the problem? What is the need? And what is the fear? And what is the desire?  You know, you know, a marketing matrix, you know, like kind of know themselves, you know, because marketing is about the user, you know, okay, that's a good idea.  How can you know yourself through these four lenses? can yourself through Thank I know, you know, like, I don't know if you heard about the clickbook of Jake Knapp, the new one.

32:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Just before entering your session, I was asking AI about it.

32:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, so they have this kind of pounding hypothesis, know, everything is a hypothesis, something to test it. The same way, if I can put something of that into the clarity, you know, remember, you know, you are, after the experience, having some insight, but at the end, it's a hypothesis.  How can we test it, you know, and how can we test it fast? So, they also have this kind of framework about the lenses, the lens of the customer, lens of, I don't know what, but what I would, we put, like, kind of these lenses, like the Joharis window, what do you know about yourself, what you don't know about yourself, what do you think others know about yourself that you don't know, but something like that, I think that will be a cool exercise, the matrix, like the four boxes, and the lens, this desire, fear, pain, and brain pain, and...  ... Problem and need. Oh, this is something that I found out. Okay, so I think with those lenses, they can understand themselves better and to see, like, where I'm at psychologically.  Because this is more psychological thing. It's not about my physicality. Or maybe I was developing another framework, you know, like, if consciousness and awareness is the bridge between mind, body, soul, and emotions, I was developing this kind of framework.  Or, know, like, in an exercise, how are you feeling? You know, how does your brain look? Or something like that.  like, unlock the motion. Like, what is the motion that you're feeling? Talk to me more about the motion. And write down in the sticky notes what is the nature of the motion?  How is it making you feel? How are you sensing your body? What kind of thoughts are you feeling? And maybe we have a board and let's unlock this emotion first, you know, like, what does?  In the end, it's uncovering the motions, you know, this kind of, I was thinking I'm doing this in workshop, but later on, if the workshops work, I want to do this in a deck of cards, know, like the integration deck, my integration deck, so like the visual frameworks from the grid, so people can do this at home, you know, at the beginning, because this is so new, I need to tell them how to do it.  So I was, inspiration, inspiration, I was doing, you know, I have this, I put like kind of the exercise of the model of integrated consciousness, so it's like, how does your mind look at the moment, you know, write down everything and put it like kind of in, put it in a circle, and the same way with spirit, what are your spiritual beliefs, how do you feel about the spirit, what do you think it is, you know, the same with emotions, what are the emotions that you feel you in your biology, how are they affecting you, you know, so they give them this is this is giving them giving them giving them  More clarity and more clarity, and this is just some examples of how can we help them, you know, like have this sharpened clarity about the different aspects of their system, their inner system, and how getting to know it, they are going to have more clarity because people don't need help in the external part of life.  They are successful, they have money, or they have things that they have, but it's always with the inner part.  They don't know, they don't have the frameworks to know the inner part of themselves, you know, so this is with their workshop, and then if they have all these ideas, you know, like now let's prioritize what is the best things that you can do right now, you know, like how can we, if all the things that you already seen about your psychology, like what are the next steps for you, you know, and maybe to have them decided, you know, what's giving you the most energy, what is going to get you  We're committed. What is going to make the most impact around your whole inner system? So how can we get to the root choice?  That's why it's called root. We want to get to the root. We need to choose the most aligned decision that is going to be aligned with your energy, with your clarity, and what you can cope with.  So this is one. And maybe another one, it's just, I haven't done more about it, but it's about the identity map, the identity research.  It's just about welcoming them. It's about, you know.

36:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So before you explain this one, sorry to interrupt. Okay. Because you have so many ideas. So let me see if I can locate myself.

36:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Sorry if I go fast. No, no, no. No problem.

37:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I just want to make sure that I got it. You have, so your business changed the name, but it's the same business, right?  I mean, there's some differences, but like the how of things and the why, they're not too different. The what is different, perhaps.

37:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The what, it's different, but I'm trying to not do more retreats, but like work digitally with people. And doing it, it's, I think for me it's better because I, if I get to the main root of the problem of the people, it's, they get frustrated, they are confused.  They always ask, what do I do next, you know? So that's why the workshop, it's, I found the workshop gives you a lot of clarity.  The same with the marketing teams and all of those kind of organizations, you know, like where are we headed?  You know, like, what are we going to do as a group? So that's why I found the workshop in system.  Got it. Got it. And also no one in the psychedelic field is doing this kind of workshop. They call workshops, you know, people talking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So word of advice. I love the format of the workshop, of course, but I'm noticing that sometimes calling things workshop is not helpful because the market doesn't associate that.  But of course, I love workshops. Got it. And you've run a few of these, right? You've used Mural many times.  Have you run the same workshop more than once? Same format?

38:45 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I think I need to go to my Mural because I've done other kind of workshops. And, you know, this is called the integration workshop.  Oh, let me get to the… Okay. So, you know, it's very simple, but I don't have the kind of the framework.  it's welcome to the integration, right? So we need to plan seeds of change and growth, you know. So be intentional with what you see.  What was your dose? And this is more about kind of this sequencing, but it's not an actual workshop. It's just a sequencing of doing things.  is something that I've done. And now do a collage or a mind map of what you've seen, you know, and people get here and put different images of a space of childhood or sadness.  This is something that works. They find it really cool. And I did this with 26 people and they're like, okay, I've never done this and I like it, you know, this is something.  A new way of expressing my ideas and having them down here, it's, you know, like, it's helpful. You know, like, what was your intention?  You know, what did you discover? But this is not something. Like in a frame of exercise, it just prompts, right?  But this working people like the way they're doing. And I also have this is for integration and I have one for preparation.  That is, you know, like vision versus intention, you know, like the astronomers or the biologists, they don't get attached into their instruments, you know, like they just observe and they come back, you know, they develop the vision and then intention is just something that you do.  So with this, I have, you know, like some instructions, you know, like how have you prepared for the experience?  You know, what is the objective of this dynamic and things like that? What is the, how would you like your preparation to be or like what were you missing?  And also it's just about prompting and this work, but I just don't want to do prompts, you know, I want to do like kind of exercise because I think it's more complete.  Well, yes, I've done it. Good times. Okay. And I have, this is also good, you know, like I think this, this exercise, this is an exercise, it's just not an actual problem, but people like it.  So it's one I was telling them, just imagine that you have achieved your like desire integration, you know, so for this time you get the opportunity to travel into the DeLorean to the future, you know, so explain to me what, what had to happen so you can achieve your vision, you know, and then I have them like stick notes and they start doing the emergence part, exploration part of, brainstorm of ideas, you know, so with that it's helping to the clarity of what they need to do.  So with this kind of preparation, they also have super clarity before the actual exploration. So this is to refine their intention.  This is, this is, this is, is the ones that I've done. I haven't done this one, but I know, like, when you need to develop identity, you start with the values.  So I don't want to go too far. Let's just, I'm going to pause here and listen to you, to what you think.

42:14 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So lots of cool stuff happening. And the reason why I asked about, like, which ones have you run multiple times is that making the workshops pretty with templates, it's more than pretty, but as an approximation, it's a little bit like polishing them, right?  So, like, just making them better. And if we start doing that and then we realize more things about the workshop because we are running it, then we might need to rework things.  And some level of rework is always good, of course. But I think that there's a... of me that is a little bit unsure about, can we find of the several ideas you present, can we find one and say this one, let's make like templates on this one and this workshop that already works will get upgraded, and then you read it a few more times and see if the templates work and if the style works and so on.  Does this, how do you feel about this?

43:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I get you, yeah, we need to test it, right? It's kind of also a prototype and we don't want to also put so much, so much time in something that maybe needs to be reworked, right?

43:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, and also like there's an element, I don't know if I'm getting this right, so forgive me if I'm not and correct me if I'm not, but I think you are more creative, creatively independent than most people, right?  You can make a lot of things, you know how use the softwares and you try and experiment, know how to make these things.  And because of that, there's not a lot of barriers between you having an idea and you starting to work on that idea, because you know how to use the things, you don't need to call anyone, right?  I'm like that. And I think that one of the good things about the templates is that they will give you a little bit more like a closed box, and then you're forced to use that box a few times, and then maybe we're evolve the templates, but you're stuck with them enough times to see like the nuance, so, ah, when I ask this prompt, even though the question is open, most people, they answer one of three things, right?  At Insight, we can use and improve the templates and turn that into kind of a visual framework. So instead of just prompt and space, you can have prompt, and...  A figure, I don't know, where people drag themselves to that figure, right? It's an easy way to level up a prompt-based facilitation, right?  We just notice the patterns, and we transform the most common answers into things that people can see on the canvas and can interact with.  How do you feel about this?

45:21 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like it. I get you. Also, it's going to be like my scientific lab, you know, because I'm having my tables in a way, you know, and in the tables I can do more observations, you know, it's not about free-flowing, so I cannot connect.  So this is one of the things that I want to put some of my effort into building this, because working into boxers, it's time boxing or closed box or this.  I think this is where I can see something with a better perspective. That's why when we do the microscope, we don't put it everywhere.  We put it in a little...

46:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. Okay, got it. So, yeah, so the plan that I suggest is, you sent me the links for that one, the pictures of the people in the woods, like a Benetton picture of people of all races, all styles.

46:28 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You want the link of that?

46:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, please. Oh, that's a Muro? Okay, but I think I can open it as well. You're now using Muro or Miro, Mark?  What do you use, Mark?

46:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  It's because I think if I share the Miro, they're going to see all of my things, and I just, with Mural, it's just, they cannot access my room.  I don't know, the last time I sent a Miro, they got into my team, in a way, or I don't know if I shared correctly.  Oh, I know, I know, I know.

47:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, Miro is a  about that. I know what you mean. When you add someone to the board, the default option is to add them as the team member, and then Miro charges you for it.  This is a  move. But then there's another option underneath, which is like, just as a board visitor, I think.  We can do it together if you want. I can show you.

47:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I fell for that more than once.

47:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  How can we do it?

47:27 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, okay. So you're...

47:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Go back, please. In the Miro or Miro?

47:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  In the Miro.

47:35 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so you want to share something. Anyone in that workspace, people without a Miro account with a link can edit.  Yes. Yes, okay, that's it. Then you send me that link. Okay.

47:52 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I send it to you, and all this is for the... Oh, I need to make a login.

48:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, this is good to know. What is that? It's asking me for a login.

48:20 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But it shouldn't ask you, right? I thought no, but...

48:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Anyone, people with... Copy link. Oh, yeah, okay. So the second link is good. The second link is good. Try the third one.

48:51 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  The third one? Okay, I'm going on the third one. Is it the same one? Yeah. Third and the second work.

49:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It was the first one that was not great. Okay, so now I'm on this thing. Okay, I'm entering as a visitor.  I'm not logged in. Okay. Okay. Let me save this. Okay. So you've sent me... Is it always the same thing?  I'll show you. Sorry, this part is a bit messy, but let's go. So this is what I'm seeing, right?  And you sent me the first link, which is this one. And this first link enter as a visitor. Okay, the thing is hidden.  The content is hidden. think you need to reveal it. Okay, let me go there.

50:22 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Which one is it? What's the name of it?

50:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The first link is the integration generation 2.

50:32 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  You have a great Spanish, sir. I like it.

50:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I can understand. I just don't feel very confident speaking. Integration. I watch Casa de Papel.

50:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, Vishen, Vishen, Vishen, Vishen, Vishen, Vishen. No, that's... Can you zoom out? That one is okay, right? This one...

51:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's good, and this one is, everything is locked.

51:14 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Try this one. Have you tried the pip decks?

51:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Uh, no, I have not. They're still locked. They're nice, this one.

51:35 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yeah, I think I want to get them.

51:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I think I know what's happening. So when you are sharing, I think you need to put me as people that have the link can edit.

51:55 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Try. It's loading up.

51:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Enter as a visitor. Thank Thank Well, there's a visitor. Okay. And now I can edit. But it needs to be revealed by a facilitator.  Wow, I don't know.

52:11 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But it's revealed.

52:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  This same way, I'm going to paste this link on your site. This thing. Okay. It seems that you are opening them.  Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. So there's this one, and there's this one. So that first one, it's very clear to me how to transform it.  This one says step two? Yeah, I don't.

53:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Maybe that's a mistake. Okay. So this is step one?

53:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Okay. And it's like this. Oh, can you? I'll log in, and then I'll add it. Okay. So for now, this is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to create a version of this.

53:54 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Well, can you do it in Miro? I prefer Miro.

54:07 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So we can create it there, and we'll use that to then fine tune and to experiment what we can do.  In terms of visual language, if I look at this, is this the visual language you would like?

54:38 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you need access to my brand book?

54:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, it would be nice. Everything helps.

54:50 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Can you send me your email here in the... For sure, for sure.

54:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes. Thank you. Send.

55:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes, it should be in your inbox. But with the brand book, I'm trying to... How can I say it?  What's possible to design it in the... In the mirror, like...

55:29 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  You want to keep it as much inside of Miro as possible? Without extra... Stuff?

55:40 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  No, I want it to be nice, but as simple as well, you know? I like how you sent me one of your workshops.  You have like a YouTube workshop that you use this kind of... You use emojis to explain ideas. Maybe I don't know if...  Ah, know. or... But something that it's really, that I don't want it to look like that much corporate or that much, I want it to be just simple but fun, you know, intuitive, decide.  Like the framework you did to me, like kind of this, you know, I don't know how to explain, you know, because I like the Rootman brand new.  When you see the brand new, you will understand, and that it's just to see, like, what colors can you use and things like that.

56:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I think I know what you mean. I think I know what you mean. This is not a bank, right?  So, no, that's good. Okay, so I'll do this. I'll have a version ready in a week from now. Oh, and do you think you can try to see, it would be good if you could test it with a new template?  Yes, yes, I want test.

57:13 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Got it. Perfect.

57:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So you sent me the design assets, you sent me the links. Okay, so just a final thing. Because we are aiming for, we're thinking about this not in terms of, like, amount of time, but we're thinking about this unique, like, task, and the task is to design assets for one workshop.  We need to keep it somewhat fixed in terms of scope so it doesn't go on forever and just fizzles out at the end.  So I'm thinking that... that... Thank you. I can do, like, this first version, and then we can do two major revisions, but other smaller ones.

58:09 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Do you feel comfortable with it? Yes. Well, in the first version, are you also helping me translate maybe some prompts in kind of an exercise, or do you want to stay just in the prompting things?  Because in the ones that I send you, it's just, like, actual, like, just prompts, in a way. Mm-hmm.

58:37 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let me open you here. Okay. So this one, I think, is promptable. Mm-hmm. This one, I think it's pretty good as it is, just give it some boxes to organize it better, and so on.

59:07 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Or maybe that one, just divide it in for, you know, like, how are you experienced mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and energetically or physically, something like that.  Or I don't know, it's just an idea. Maybe with that we can play more, but because the collage is just, they're going to express everything they feel.  But maybe we can put it into, like, the main parts of the experience that it's always going to be a mentally part, emotionally part, or a spiritual part, and an energetically part.  Maybe we can put, like, kind of a matrix or something like that. Or what do you think about that?

59:54 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'm thinking. Here's what I'm thinking.

59:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  wasn't talk a like, Everybody and offense anys. You

1:00:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I suspect that the good thing about the collage exercise is that it is automatically an exploring exercise, right? People just start putting things in, and they don't filter too much.  They filter a little bit, but not too much, right? We can always go back to the exercise and then ask them, Ike, which one of these is more like spiritual for you?  Oh, this one. Which one of these is more mental for you? one. Stuff like this. If we ask them to do the two things at the same time, do the collage and organize the collage, people will participate less because they're like, oh, I really want to make sure I get it right, you know?  So if we do that, if we separate the collage into different lenses, I would say we do it in two phases.  First of the collage. Good, good. Now let's go back to the collage and change something about it. so I think that's...  that's... It's an easy thing to do. And for instance, an example, to give an example of how the second round of the exercise could go.  We could have. OK, so imagine that there's this thing here, right? And there's wait. There's this one, there's this one, and there's this one, right?  And you say, OK, now I want you, second round, right? They did the course. Now I want you guys to take the red one, which is the heart, I don't know, and put it on top of the picture that we use speaks more about the heart.  You know, that's an easy thing to do. Everyone gets a set of things. And in that way, you can do both sides of the exercise.  They probably won't. Oh yeah, this one is the heart, this one is the head, and this one, I don't know, you know what I mean.  So it's like tokens that people move like chips on the poker table, right? This one, I think we can also begin with a prompt, but it's possible that we make this prompt more interesting to fill in.  Okay, same.

1:02:36 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  And I think you, maybe with your creative power and your experience with workshopping, maybe you could also, you know, kind of tropicalize or do something fresh or just maybe.  At the end, also wanted with kind of each face like kind of an exercise so they can play with it and have.  If there's a problem, maybe they just write some things. Maybe with an exercise, they write things, but it's more like when you go to the gym, it's not like just do whatever.  It's not like right now we're going to do the biceps and then we're going to do this. know, like, I don't know if it's bad me.

1:03:25 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so we can do that. can do that. Here's the thing. The more we, for instance, this exercise, it's relatively easy to transform it into kind of a quest, right?  At the start, please make a mental map of the thing that you carry in your psychologic backpack, right? And then you can have, like, drawings of a backpack and people do the collage inside of the backpack.  Do that, right? And as we move through the exercise, people could also, like Jumanji, they could move through the board, right?  We could do that also.

1:04:17 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  I like that.

1:04:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I don't think we should do that on the first version. Okay. Because if we need to change a little thing, we need to change everything, right?  So, for now, it's when we talk about the mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics, so we're just tidying up the mechanics, like people know what to do, there's places where they can answer, and so on.  As this gets really tight, then we move into something that is a little bit more visual or more narrative, like this is an expedition, put on your hat, we're moving through the board, look, there's a crocodile, you know, stuff like this.  But I would not start with that, because if we need to change the workshop, we'll lose everything, we'll go back to square one.

1:04:59 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Yes. Yeah, but I like that maybe not the actual frames or images of the backpack, but maybe once you start working with it, maybe you also get idea, you know, maybe this could be a good idea, you know, like what are people carrying?  And maybe it's a primer or an exercise, not just with images, but just kind of a suggestion to put that.  And that's why this is something that I would also like. Maybe, I don't know if you feel comfortable, but just also like kind of your spice.  It's like getting with a chef that with your experience, maybe not designing the whole imagery and the illustration things, but just kind of the mechanics of what might you do if you were me, you know, like kind of that in the flow.  Like when you see the macro flow, like what I'm trying to do is for them to integrate and to have clarity, you know, like what do you do when you work with people or corporate?  Organizations to get clarity, you know. So in a way, it's just, let's get insights, and then insights into actions, but also taking in consideration the emotional part of this, you know.

1:06:17 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  There's lot of things at the same time, right?

1:06:24 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Have fun, play, play, play. Yeah, I will play, I will play.

1:06:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Good, good. Okay, okay. So let's schedule another one for next week so I can show you what I did next week.  Perfect.

1:06:41 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, just a second.

1:06:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Stop sharing. There's that thing. Let it go. Okay. I'll see you. Thank you. Okay. Okay.

1:07:03 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Got the link.

1:07:05 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay. I've placed a link here to schedule another one. Good. So for this, I think we're set. You sent me a briefing.  have stuff to work with. Can I send you the proposal document just to formalize things? Yes, of course.

1:07:26 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Let's do that as soon as possible. We can motivate ourselves.

1:07:36 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay. I'm excited about this. There's a lot of good stuff that we can do here.

1:07:43 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Thank you, Jorge. Thank you. Have a good one, and please let me know when can we schedule. You send me your calendar, please.

1:07:51 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, just pick a time for next week, maybe Monday or Tuesday, and we'll do it. Okay.

1:07:57 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  But do you have your link with you at the moment? It's here, it's on the chat.

1:08:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, perfect.

1:08:02 - Jorge Elizondo (expandiendoconsciencia.com)
  Okay, see you then next week. See you next week. Bye.
