0:00 - Nate Jebb
  But the more I prefer the analog, like before it felt almost like, well, they're similar, know, now it's just, I don't know where we are.  Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of thoughts on that as well. Before we start, and I'm sorry about this, I have a call at the hour mark.  Okay. So win 50 something minutes.

0:28 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. No problem. No problem. So let me share the screen. Boom. Boom. It looks a little bit different because I changed the layout, but it's the same questions.  All the answers are here. So I just put them in here. Right. This is so cool, man. I was so excited to meet with you.

0:54 - Nate Jebb
  Thank you.

0:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Thank you. I mean, it's, it's, it's good to do this right. I'm having a little. fun and any excuse for us to meet is always good but the additional bonus of you know putting in the reps and be useful after you've helped me so much it makes it better awesome so okay so last on on on our last session we gorgeous do you see my screen yeah my screen yeah I can also send you the link yes I'm going to I don't think there's a password on that oh there is a password it's Nate it's twice no no no caps small text okay I'm in perfect so I'll pull you to me we now we're seeing that we're looking at the same thing right  So on our last conversation, we got into this thing. Some views on your craft, on what you do, and some views on your worldview of things.  And the thing we'll do right now is to try to start to pull this stuff into here and to see what stands out, right?  OK. So the first question is some concepts that we have surfaced, some ideas that we have surfaced. And did I agree with that thing, the purple thing?  Oh, yeah, it's here. So one of the things was the turbo relativity for spicacy, CT. equity from NACIS, I don't know, you introduced that, but I don't remember.  And did you marinate on this for a bit during the week?

3:15 - Nate Jebb
  I didn't, you know, because part of it, I didn't realize that that was, I should have, but I didn't, I didn't ask you to do it, so I did not, it didn't do anything wrong.  Yeah, and I don't feel on the spot, but you know what's funny is these, I answered you from the heart, and I just feel I could speak to them exactly, because I'll just answer from the heart again, you know, and it's coming from the same source.

3:40 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So if you were to select maybe one postage from each column, which one would you pick? From every column, not just belief scenarios, but what's one business, what's one desire?  Yeah, now from each. Yeah, the leaves in there. It's a white column. Be extremely logical is a top priority as like, that's not good.

4:10 - Nate Jebb
  That's the one I would pick.

4:12 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm. So let me change the part of it. Mm hmm.

4:22 - Nate Jebb
  Listen with the level of intensity most cannot match. Mm hmm. The Ray Ban glasses point of view of the practitioner.  Mm hmm.

4:55 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm hmm.

5:13 - Nate Jebb
  Failure of nerve, the book, it's in bottom left, yeah, yeah, up one, yeah, there go.

5:24 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and now let's do the same on the thing underneath.

5:55 - Nate Jebb
  Breaking with the habit of following others' advice. First first bottom line for the first white column The key thing makes sense right yeah, yeah, right Looking for materials for my art Yes overview book Let's copy this thing  It's funny, those are all the exact same point, all four of those.

7:23 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'll just change this so it fits better. You said that all of these are the same point?

7:35 - Nate Jebb
  least the last four, where I don't know about the first four.

7:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Interesting. I do see that there's a thread, but I didn't assume that they were the same thing. Which one of these do you think relates?  Let's try to distribute them according to these four boxes. We don't need to fill in all the boxes. If we were to move them around related to your methods and the way you work, these things could indicate something about how you work, what you do, who you do it for, why you do it, why you do it in that way, why you don't do it in a certain way, and we can duplicate them.  It can be at a different place at the same time.

8:29 - Nate Jebb
  All right, I'll just start on the being extremely logical as top priority. That's both who I work with and how I work.

8:43 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Listen with the level of intensity most cannot match is how I work.

8:52 - Nate Jebb
  Buying Ray-Ban Metaglass is that that's kind of like what I would do. That's like a high concrete tool, basically.  Failure of nerve is... Wow. I was gonna say it's how I work, but it's really why I'm alive, I think.  You know, that's a much bigger point. That's what I'm trying to seek in life. But if it relates also to how you work, you can...

9:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, then I'll put it in how I work, too.

9:32 - Nate Jebb
  It's similar. Oh, if I believe God's asking me to do something, that has to do with who I work with, too.  Because if they can't tell the truth, I can't really help them. I can't help people out of that. And then that is also how I work.  If I believe God's asking me to do something Jazz review book is both what I'm doing and how I'm doing it Sorry, I think it said what and how What explain why again to me why what why I'm doing this worker

11:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  can relate to many things. So it's really why at the most basic level. So why do this work? Why do do it like this?  Why you like this work? Why you don't want to do things in a certain way? It's just really a prompt to it.  Can you use it as the brother sense? Or just think out loud when we together? I'd say breaking with habit of following others advice is part of why I'm doing this work.

11:24 - Nate Jebb
  Like I need to be autonomous and work in my own instinct. Looking for materials for my art is that's what I'm doing.  That's how I'm doing it. That's why I'm doing it. I don't know if it applies to who but it applies to all the others.  It may even apply to who because in a way I want to work with people who have you know, in art, not necessarily like painting, but  Richard, they view what they're doing as an art, you know. They may not even say that, but you can see it in how they do it.  Yes, yes.

12:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  The way I see it is like a certain relationship to the crafts, the, you know, respect for the process and the news and so on.  Okay, so the idea now is that we take these things and we pick a few that we want to focus a bit more on, right?  Because this is like a broccoli, right, or a fractal. We can go deep on any one of them. But let's, let's try to see if we can pick some that, that we want to focus on.  And before we do that, I'll change the colors of each one so that we can see when they're repeating.  Okay. So like this one is orange, this one is up, this one could be this. You're good at Miro.

13:14 - Nate Jebb
  You're fast in it. Oh, I think Miro is like Spotify.

13:19 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  It's always open from my computer. Yeah.

13:22 - Nate Jebb
  But thank you. I use it a lot.

13:42 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Pink maybe. Jazz review book. So this one was in a lot of places. And it's purple. Where is purple?  Okay. I think we have, we just don't have this one, the turbo. Oh yeah, sorry, we can put that in, I'd like to put that in.

14:16 - Nate Jebb
  It's definitely how I work, and it's definitely who I work with. I am able to work with anyone because I can pick up what they're doing quickly enough that I don't make them repeat themselves.

14:33 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So I think, yes, yes, yes.

14:41 - Nate Jebb
  Actually, weirdly, it's also why I'm doing it. I mean, that's like one of my most inherent needs, it's not just that I can do it.  I want to work at that speed.

14:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I have difficulty working at a slower speed.

14:58 - Nate Jebb
  Mm-hmm.

14:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  At some point I was like, These things really connect, right? It's difficult to, I think, especially for real life people.  Yeah, yeah. OK, good. So I'll bring them here, right, bring them here. And now let's think about ways to prioritize them.  If it is important to you, we can add a number of how many times they showed up. But I don't feel that's necessary.  This one, come on. You know, it's the same size. OK, how would you place them, assuming like at this point here is like,  really relevant doesn't have to be done today just not nice to have and as we go up it's something that you feel that is impactful for the way you talk about your work and it's something that you really want to address sooner rather than later.

16:14 - Nate Jebb
  I would say the most impactful and urgent so top right is listen with level of intensity that most cannot match and I'm actually in this moment I'm applying it to the way that I'm running this business not just listening to people but being silent and listening to get you know that intensely.

16:38 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Perfect so this one up here let's do the other ones if you want I can drag them or if you want to drag them yourself it's fine we can do it.

16:46 - Nate Jebb
  Okay um I don't know am I allowed to yeah okay I can all right yeah I'll drag them myself  Uh He's are in a way the same it's like this is the what that's that's the alright I I'm just doing my gut feel I don't really know why I'm Mm-hmm exactly placing it anywhere, but Okay Anything

18:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Ends out to you.

18:03 - Nate Jebb
  Well, I was surprised that looking for material for my art didn't feel urgent, because I was kind of thinking of it as similar to listen with a level of intensity that most cannot match.  I thought of that as the same, but then this one is not urgent. This one is very urgent. And the difference is this one feels like in act of creative exploration.  And this one feels like it. So this is more play and an act of dependence. And in a good way, an unwillingness to move forward until I've heard a command, you know, and I don't mean these things religiously.  I'm talking about waiting on the muse till I hear something. So the difference is why I'm doing the behavior.

18:58 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, so let me make a quick note here. Can you rephrase what you said or restate? This one's about play.

19:31 - Nate Jebb
  This is play and this is about dependence.

19:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  That's an interesting word. Why do you use that word? Is it E or D?

19:49 - Nate Jebb
  E and CE I believe. Dependent. This is like something I would do on a Saturday, and this is something I do on a Monday, and the difference is, and there's something underneath this too, because this may actually be more important, but looking for materials for my art in the better frame of mind, but when I'm scared I kind of seek control, this feels like the listen with level of intensity feels like a obsessive kind of control, like in a way I'm saying dependence on God, but I'm also emphasizing I'm gonna kind of ring his neck until I hear a word from him, whereas this is no expectation on it, the point of this is just play.  So, and I've seen this as a theme in my life. I always do better here materials for art than I do here.  because this I get very serious and tense here there's no tension and I've told my wife before like I'm the best when I'm like pulling a prank like I call it a shenanigans muscle so I almost feel like I'm disagreeing now with how it's structured I almost feel like this one the materials for art is the urgent one this this feels urgent now because that's the way I really need to just spend time living this one the reason I said urgent is because it has a sense of fear and control to it so it's like I wanted it to be urgent you know but it may not be the right thing to emphasize got it but in that way we could perhaps

22:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  or both of them, we could perhaps explore both of them. why doesn't it, never mind. And then figure out this from both angles, right?

22:23 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, that's actually quite interesting, the difference.

22:32 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Let's do it differently. Let's not change their positions on the board, but let's make them... Can I make a side note that's interesting is this.

22:45 - Nate Jebb
  This one, by necessity, is not urgent. It can't be urgent. That's the point. And that's why I'm so much looser and more effective here.

23:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Now at a meta level is it urgent that I spend more time being that way kind of but also That's the wrong way to that's the wrong angle to approach it from Yeah, yeah, I understand it's It's a bit of a Think they call it ambidextrous in like companies like you need to be good at doing your thing And you need to be good at creating your next thing and it's very difficult to do Both of these motions at the same time in a company.  Yeah, because they require different ways of thinking and Sometimes you're gonna have like different people doing that, right? But can I read you this?

23:39 - Nate Jebb
  This is from TS Eliot's a four quartets. Okay. Mm-hmm in order to arrive at what you are not Must go through the way in which you are not And that's exactly what we're talking about here if I want to be more of this looking for materials for my art I can't  it urgently. I can only approach it lightly. So I didn't fully hear your ambidextory thing because I was looking at the book, but tell me that I can do it.

24:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  No, no problem.

24:11 - Nate Jebb
  So there's a tension here, right?

24:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  And there's a tension between Monday stuff. thought that was a great analogy Monday stuff and Saturday stuff. Because it is a Saturday stuff that will eventually change your Mondays, but not the next Monday.  will change like your among the weeks from now. But if you only do the Saturday stuff, the Monday stuff comes around and it's a problem.  So that's what I thought about the idea of ambidextory. We need to be able to balance doing both kind of at the same time.  Difficult and tense and so on. Got it. Okay. Let's speak to others to focus on, to other aspects to focus on.  I would say the jazz overview book in the in the turbo readability Okay, cool, so it's this this this and this and place it here Okay So from that conversation We're looking at these four things, right?  Yeah, and now our prompt is Tell me about tell me like we can role play we can find ways of doing this that make the most sense here Tell me how you do your thing like and I'll try to make a You  A basic process of it.

26:04 - Nate Jebb
  Like for work, what I do.

26:06 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Like a typical engagement or an expected engagement.

26:13 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, so everything really follows that classic divergent, convergent shape, both the interviews like in their own way and the entire project.  The first interview is trying to shape the nature of the work. And so it's almost like what we're trying to come up with is.  What is the size of the knowledge that we need to document?

26:59 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So imagine like. It's an archaeology dig.

27:01 - Nate Jebb
  Are we digging up like Brabs and seashells? Is it that or are we digging up a t-rex? Like how much can we do and how much time do we think it'll take?  Was it uncover?

27:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, I think it had the different words. Uncover, yeah.

27:21 - Nate Jebb
  Like I said archaeology, know, thinking about digging up the the fossils.

27:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay.

27:43 - Nate Jebb
  Then I think one of my I think my favorite part of the entire thing is the unstructured interviews. Mm-hmm because I'll ask the person like so so like we've picked a scope right like for this client Blue Delta.  Means we picked we're gonna make sure that they're more consistent on all of their travel So they do 200 events a year.  We're gonna make sure the level of quality is the same for every event So that's the scope Then I get to the unstructured interviews and I just say to the guy who runs the events really well Tell me about your last event Mm-hmm And then whatever he's saying I kind of play jazz off of what he's saying, you know, it's like well Okay, you know at our last event We were at a golf course and I saw someone They didn't they had their ipad, but they didn't bring the charger.  So they had to use the Paper form, but then they pulled out a pen that looked like it was really old and we sent we sell like $500 jeans I'm like, why are you using a dirty pen?  Like so they give these examples And then I'm saying to um Why do you think they're Why do you think that wouldn't have occurred to them?  Don't use a dirty pen. We're talking to executives on a golf court. And then he said, well, you're younger, plus they're not thinking like that way.  And I was like, what do you mean that way? So you're just kind of trying to feel around for their MO, their way of operating, way that they're what they believe about the whole thing, kind of like what you're doing with me right now.  It's like they believe every detail should look good. Why do the other guys not believe that? Because it seems like they kind of should or they do, but they're not acting like it.  So that's right. And then out of that, I'll show you. Can I share my screen for a moment? Mm-hmm, because I'm like so proud of this.  I Hired my friend who's a copywriter and you're not gonna be able to read what I'm showing because it's just too much, but you'll See it.  I hired my friend who's a copywriter and I I sent him the The let me present I Sent him the unstructured interview videos And he's really a smart guy and he spent 10 hours on them like he it's three hours of videos So he listened to it really thoughtfully He gave me creative direction notes at a top level and then if you scroll down, I'm gonna scroll down Okay, I know you're reading These are the questions that we need to film on video Like what do events mean for blue delta and then he gives like a possible answer to spark  thinking What does this toolkit like that we pack mean for our team? Now or what is this toolkit like the video content we're recording mean for this team?  What do we do at the events? Well, we do golf casino and corporate events. What do they look like?  We set up at a tea box. So he took the mess and really tightened it up I mean, this is a phenomenal document, but he's really um He's skilled at tightening things up, you know And so I want his process here Can you can you still know you don't see that share this to haven't said Like this is what he said he did Reviewing and making notes on the interviews three hours Organizing the notes one hour creating a hierarchy two hours musing on the structure writing and organizing formatting like That's exactly what I want someone doing.  I cannot do that. It's not how my brain works. And so that's just a really...

32:13 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But so what Chris did was that he processed the notes and the questions and the recording and the transcripts into this one document, right?  Yeah.

32:23 - Nate Jebb
  And the reason that's so valuable is when I come out of the unstructured interviews, if you asked me any question about it, I could really speak well to it.  I don't know how to even package up what I now know. So what Chris did is like I elicited the right things from the interviewee and Chris consolidated it into a level of clarity.  I don't have the ability to do. So after that's Chris's process, my creative director's process. And one of the things we're saying now is we're saying instead of gather, organize, train, I'm saying collect...  collect, classify, coach, you know, just so it's easier to remember, I'll seize. But the unstructured interviews, that's collect, consolidation of collected insights, that's kind of classify right there, you know, like you're trying to get it tighter.  And then we then film again. But this time we say like, we ask questions in that document and they answer more concisely, you know, so we tend to have these sprawling answers, and then all of that is recorded in Fathom.

33:48 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Okay, and structure ones as well?

33:53 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, the unstructured are recorded in Fathom, but we don't really, I don't know yet. Because this is the right now is the first time I'm building out this AI tool for a client because all the others have been through playbook builder And I'm just now hitting the moment where I'm making for a client what I've made for myself because I've only ever done this once like I don't really I've been working with Fathom for two years Myself mm-hmm never built it for a client I've always edited down the videos and put them in playbook builder and put them in these categories, so And I don't know have you ever seen playbook builder I Have when we met Yeah, think you've shared Yeah, then then you don't need it.  I mean the point is it's just an old way of doing You know so That's it, you know, and then I got to coach their team on Okay, now the here's a critical thing  In this process, is the critical thing. Skeletons in their closet, we discover skeletons in their closet. So, like, one of the examples is, I'm working with a construction company.  The project manager, when I asked him in the unstructured interview what he does, he started getting frustrated, not at me, but he was frustrated with the company.  And he explained to me that he's been asked to build buildings when the architectural drawings weren't complete. So, like, how can he build it?  am I building? There's no drawing. And it turned out that the owner is so good at sales, he doubled their sales in a year, and he didn't hire anyone new.  So the architect are really behind. And so then, after I do that unstructured interview, and I went back to the owner, he said, please be sure to tell me if I'm being an  or if anyone needs to talk to me.  Like, tell me something. And I said, oh, I'll tell you, and you are. You're a great guy, but you are selling too much and your team can't handle it.  And even though they're loyal to you, they're going to burn out in like three years and they're going to leave He said that's when he really was like you're my guy Nate like because you're telling me the truth So that's a very important part of this that I'm not yet explaining.  I don't know how to explain yet But it's come up in every client Some true thing that needs to be spoken that hasn't they're not saying to each other or at least they're not dealing with if They have said it Mm-hmm and I made a note on that and then the other thing is It's an it can't just be a video database like I'm gonna be making for blue Delta Little checklists that we put laminate and put on the key ring and put on the bags that they used to travel to events You know like a little recipe book For them, that's what's needed.  So there are there are assets that are needed That I figure out as I go It's like what do these people need and the way I figure that out is I go to the person  who is like the customer of this video database, you know, like the employee, and I say, what issues are you having?  And when I hear their issues, it's like a sales process. go, if I could show you how to solve that issue, would you wanna see it?  And they're like, sure. And then I and take this stuff I learned from the expert and I apply it to the new guy.  And that's how I get them to communicate, basically. I sell the ideas from the expert to the new guy.  Does that make sense? I think so. So I'm going to paraphrase. If I think about like a bronze level, silver level, gold level.

37:39 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  bronze level would be, I've interviewed everyone here, there's 50 hours of video, everything you need to know is there.  The silver level, it's, yes, you have the video, but you also process the video. There's like written stuff that's easier to parse, easier to search, easier to find.

38:00 - Nate Jebb
  but still doesn't connect exactly to the way they do things right it's in force fit into things and the gold level is this thing you describe which is oh I understand that for your context which unit is laminated checklists that are very easy to put on your back pocket okay so we'll do that yep so did I get it right yes but one more thing mm-hmm bronze level was right silver level actually has the checklists in the back pocket okay gold level is where I do change management I work within their team to sell everybody at the company on these ideas so I don't just make the tools for them I'm going through the company in persuading people that it's to their benefit to use these things and the way I'm doing that is I'm listening to what they need and I'm creating the tools in a way that will solve their needs so it just involves more meetings mm-hmm  Okay, okay.

39:18 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So what is like this four, these five steps, like shape nature of the work, I understand that this is maybe like the briefing of it, something like that.

39:31 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, that's shaped the nature of the work is like a 90 minute call where I ask the owners of the company, what issues are you having and they list everything out.  And then out of that we figure out which one is most important to solve using this knowledge management tool.  Because I believe if we get rid of a pain, it will be more exciting to the company than if we just make a little library on the side.  Mm-hmm So in a way all of what I'm doing is like Finding problems and then finding the knowledge that's already in the company that solves those problems and facilitating that handoff Fine problems Facilitating that yeah, I'm connecting the two It's like Remember when beef he had that big oil spill Mm-hmm, and they like get a competition to ask who solved this problem and the person who solved it was a tattoo artist Because they understood they understood something about how ink and this one chemical interact And so they were  to like dissolve some of the oil using what this tattoo artist said in a way I'm facilitating a similar thing I'm going what is the problem and then I go out searching amongst the knowledge of the team figuring out Who's got info that would solve that issue?  Got it.

41:16 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Got it Uh-huh And Part of it you hours It's do I say your name right?

41:29 - Nate Jebb
  Wow? It's pretty good. It's impossible to say because it's very nasal Wow But it's good it's good, okay Um Since I just started this in January and the first two clients that I did this with were through playbook builder I've only done the old system.  Mm-hmm. I haven't yet completed an entire project

42:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  using my new system so even describing it to you I'm going oh yeah I guess that is what I'm doing because I'm just going by feel right now mm-hmm but this is helping me realize like oh that there is a method I'm doing I just I was just kind of trying to make sense as I went oh yeah and I think that's that's a lot of what we're trying to do here which is like uncovering the method yeah but there was something oh yeah okay I feel that the common pattern not just with what you describe with all the people described to me especially this kind of weird work is that people have ideas about what it means they have like their own mental model of what it is and they come to you and say oh I need this thing but then you investigate and that's a different thing that they need right yep so like for me like the example for me would be oh I need the first  It's not really a presentation that they need, but presentation is a language that they understand that they can use to communicate what they need, right?  Yeah. And... Keep going. Now, I think this is a common pattern that I'm noticing on, like, weird work and it could be interesting to have some framework for that to help them connect what they think they need, like, connect the language they have with what they do, right?

43:27 - Nate Jebb
  Well, in here, I use this tool from Procter & Gamble, okay? And this is what I'm... This is what I believe.  Are you sharing something? Yeah, I'm going to share it right now, I'm trying to get it. They did a...  How do I attach a file, you know? I can just show it to you. All right, hold on. visualizing.  Okay. Here it is. This is from Procter & Gamble and they did a study over their huge company with tons and tons of people and if someone's not getting their work done, it's one of these nine reasons.  So everything I'm doing is trying to solve for one of the things. Some of them, like if it's a tool or a job aid, I can build that.  Some of them, like staffing or org structure, like that's I need to tell the truth to the owner. Information and reference, that's like what they think I'm building.  lot of times, the number one issue is role expectations. I mean, that's the far and away most important and a lot of times, just by me asking what they do, it clarifies the expectations.  So I solve for the.

45:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  things but that's my model that is what I'm doing mm-hmm okay it is really good because we can use that yep quite a bit okay um so let's let's cross-check these things right yeah first I think we have a bit I feel we're still exploring I think the blue the blue process yeah because you get the structure interviews based on the previous synthesis or perhaps happens after that well I have to decide what product I'm making you know I always have to make the Fathom video portal which is like they have to download Fathom and have these calls recorded and then they can search them and I show them how to search them but I'm

46:00 - Nate Jebb
  So we're going to have decided during the unstructured videos and structured, do they have any of the other problems on that nine influences list?

46:10 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  if so, what is our solution? We have to come up with a solution to that problem.

46:15 - Nate Jebb
  So if the solution is like, we're going to make a physical checklist, then I need to make the checklist and design it and print it and edit on their bags.  So at this point, after I've filmed them answering the questions tightly, the actual knowledge base is done. But the project is not complete because at the beginning of when we said shape the work, there was a reason we were doing this and we were going to measure it somehow.  And for Blue Delta, it was the events have to be the same. our solution has to be a belief.  a to get all of the events to be the same. And the solution that I proposed was, I'll make a database for you, I'll make checklist for you.  And then also, the manager of the team, I said to him, I wanna be direct, feel free to throw this out if it's wrong.  You are a very skilled person and you're not giving your team enough time to take work off your plate.  That's why there's unevenness. And he said, yes, that's true. And I said, but you do seem like you're willing to be honest with yourself and take ownership.  Why aren't you? And he said, I think I'm just impatient. I don't wanna hear them work it out. It'll take 15 minutes or 10 minutes for him to talk it out.

47:41 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I'd rather just say three.

47:43 - Nate Jebb
  And I said, but you're also telling me you don't wanna do that. So how can I support you to not do that?  And he said, just text me, hold me accountable. And so I said, okay, I'm gonna start texting you. don't have to respond to me.

47:53 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  But I'm just gonna say, are you asking questions?

47:55 - Nate Jebb
  You know? So that's a deliverable.

48:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah Okay, okay, okay, let's put a pin on that. I'll go I'll go back to that But you know what I'm realizing is I don't actually have Now that I'm not focused on playbook go their own way.

48:22 - Nate Jebb
  I don't have a very clean deliverable Mm-hmm as it could be any I feel like it could be anything, you know, and that's danger for me.

48:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Mm-hmm I agree. I agree that that is a dangerous thing Especially for creative people because we fall in love with the act of creating a new tool or a new Assessment or anything like that.  I also think that it's a little bit like the quote you said before earlier There's an element especially at this stage of understanding  Like what kind of investments in terms of time energy focus attention You need to make to realize. Okay, so you're prototyping actually.  Yeah, even paid to prototype What what's the best way of? What's the best deliverable, right? Yes, and I think as long as you keep it in within that frame And you don't call yourself product Development thing.  Yeah, I Think you're fine. Yeah I also I I Sometimes fall into that as you for sure now and I've been trying to step away from there from that because it's that's that's Saturday And I'm creating anything Well, and I also should know I have not promised any of that in the statement of work Okay, it's much much smaller than that So that thing is like a bonus You

50:00 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah, I mean the truth is No one's asking me to make that and pardon me feels like I maybe I shouldn't because I'm endangering Myself and the project by offering too much, you know Mm-hmm.  It may not be what they want even though it's what I believe will help. I mean the statement of work I have Like I'll just show you one of these I think there's one Did I send you one?

50:30 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, did I send you the Delta one?

50:34 - Nate Jebb
  Yes, yeah, so that's I Mean that all that promises is like I'm gonna build it in playbook builder, you know Mm-hmm.  We're gonna select it. We're gonna approve the interview questions.

50:46 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  We're gonna, you know, that's it Okay But you you do have this creative ability that connects to a commitment to actually changing the way they work  right right and you understand that you have the flexibility in the way you do that that allows you to you know come up with ideas that for them they're like oh my god it's so useful thank you and just it's the appropriate level of complexity that would actually get just like printed checklists are a perfect example of it really changed things yep right so what I'm thinking is and because we have like five minutes before your call I I'll just say this really quickly yep what I've been noticing for myself is that I think I need a way I think I need an outlet for this creative energy around my work and I needed that outlet to be very atomic like I can shake I can ship things really quickly yep and I don't get a lot of working progress or a lot of unfinished stuff right yes yes  Exactly.

52:01 - Nate Jebb
  Yeah.

52:01 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So for me, what I'm thinking is I should be making like a deck of concepts or a deck of ideas.  Yep. And because it's like a book that you can edit nonstop, right? And at the end, I can just add, oh, this client gave me like two more ideas.  And I just put it put it on the deck. And for the next client, I could just send them the newest version of the deck.  And as you work with new clients and you realize, oh, I need to put this concept into my Veritas method deck.  Yes. You can do that. It's a very small unit of work. It's done. And it's done forever, right? You don't need to re-edit it like a book would need to be re-edited.

52:48 - Nate Jebb
  So is the deck basically like different deliverables, like the checklist deliverable as one of the cards in the deck?  Or did I misunderstand it? Yes, it's like strategies, right?

53:00 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So, for instance, yeah, so you could say, check list, or you could say it plays, we know how to run in a deliverable, I know how to make, and I go, great, I'm going to apply this here, great, I know how to do that.

53:19 - Nate Jebb
  Yes, yes, right.

53:21 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yes.

53:23 - Nate Jebb
  And they could all be targeted at one of those nine factors of performance, you know? Absolutely. Yes, target any single one of them.  I can show you something.

53:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  I got this in the mail from some friends, I know you've got to go, so I'll just use this as a prompt for your imagination.  So, this came from a company that do like futures thinking, forecasting, that kind of thing, right? Yeah. And they have like a deck with a lot of them, and they just send me a few, like this is about urban mining.  Yep.

53:54 - Nate Jebb
  About spatial computing.

53:56 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yep. Yes, I have gotten a deck like this before, in

54:00 - Nate Jebb
  add agency and it's very effective.

54:02 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so you could start with like 10 and make it very easy for yourself to update it and you could just send them like physically this stuff.  Yes. I'm thinking about the same thing for myself as well. Yeah, I think it's a great idea because yeah it creates boundaries around that creative instinct that we have and we'll always have right right and okay so before before leave a couple things first I did some notes around here on the side related to like how I understood what you told me yes it's purpose I understand that we are still exploring a little bit of the first half but mostly it seems that the first half is about understanding mostly yeah the second half is mostly around correcting changing you know action  Have it change, yeah, deliverables and have it change.

55:04 - Nate Jebb
  Okay.

55:08 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Yeah, so my prompt for you is take a glass of water. I'll send you an email with some ideas around this next week.  You might not be able to make this time because I'll be traveling, but I'll send you an email with that.  And thank you, thank you for, this was very interesting, gave me a lot of ideas. Yeah. Thank you, man, I love talking to you.

55:30 - Nate Jebb
  I'll see you later.

55:31 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  So it's great. Thank you.

55:33 - Nate Jebb
  Have a nice one. All right, bye-bye.

55:34 - João Landeiro (joaolandeiro.com)
  Bye-bye.
